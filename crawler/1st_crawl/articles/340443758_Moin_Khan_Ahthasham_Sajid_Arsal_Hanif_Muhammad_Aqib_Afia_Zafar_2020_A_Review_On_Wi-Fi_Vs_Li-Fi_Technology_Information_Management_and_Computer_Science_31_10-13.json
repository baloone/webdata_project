Line of sight has been one of the major barriers for VLC based technology which causes eminent hindrance in the widen applicability of the technology. Li-Fi is a non-Line of Sight alternative which does not merely confine its limits or depreciates its efficiency; in fact, it makes it an ineffective option for the LoS based scenarios. This paper will discuss the hybrid approach to wireless solutions in an effort to address the said impediments. This paper also discusses the methods to minimize the lope holes which jeopardize the gains associated with the non Line of sight (NLoS) nature of the light propagation and explains ways to control eavesdropping.","authors":["Moin Khan","Ahthasham Sajid","Arsal Hanif","Muhammad Aqib"],"meta":["March 2020","DOI:10.26480/imcs.01.2020.10.13"],"references":["331620429_Visible_Light_Communication_A_System_Perspective-Overview_and_Challenges","306124378_Visible_Light_Communication_Applications_Architecture_Standardization_and_Research_Challenges","278038295_Scope_and_Challenges_in_Light_FidelityLiFi_Technology_in_Wireless_Data_Communication","26408209_WiFi_Technology_Future_Market_Challenges_and_Opportunities","325416793_Li-Fi_Technology_Data_Transmission_through_Visible_Light","315915093_The_looming_visible_light_communication_Li-Fi_An_edge_over_Wi-Fi","312410810_Li-Fi_light_Fidelity_the_future_technology_in_wireless_communication"]}
