{"id":"329625880_A_Horizon_Scan_of_Emerging_Issues_for_Global_Conservation_in_2019","abstract":"We present the results of our tenth annual horizon scan. We identified 15\nemerging priority topics that may have major positive or negative effects on\nthe future conservation of global biodiversity, but currently have low awareness\nwithin the conservation community. We hope to increase research and policy\nattention on these areas, improving the capacity of the community to mitigate\nimpacts of potentially negative issues, and maximise the benefits of issues that\nprovide opportunities. Topics include advances in crop breeding, which may\naffect insects and land use; manipulations of natural water flows and weather\nsystems on the Tibetan Plateau; release of carbon and mercury from melting\npolar ice and thawing permafrost; new funding schemes and regulations; and\nland-use changes across Indo-Malaysia.","authors":["Alice Hughes","Becky LeAnstey"],"meta":["December 2018Trends in Ecology & Evolution 34(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.tree.2018.11.001"],"references":["332159560_Daisy-chain_gene_drives_for_the_alteration_of_local_populations","328012871_De_novo_domestication_of_wild_tomato_using_genome_editing","327706251_A_Blockchain_Implementation_Prototype_for_the_Electronic_Open_Source_Traceability_of_Wood_along_the_Whole_Supply_Chain","326496818_Meat_consumption_health_and_the_environment","325890095_Decoupling_Livestock_from_Land_Use_through_Industrial_Feed_Production_Pathways","325876956_Mass_balance_of_the_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet_from_1992_to_2017","325532198_Reducing_food's_environmental_impacts_through_producers_and_consumers","328082965_Agricultural_research_or_a_new_bioweapon_system","327636491_Classifying_drivers_of_global_forest_loss","325867856_Mercury_in_Active-Layer_Tundra_Soils_of_Alaska_Concentrations_Pools_Origins_and_Spatial_Distribution"]}
