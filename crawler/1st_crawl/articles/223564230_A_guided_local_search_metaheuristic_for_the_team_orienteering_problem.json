{"id":"223564230_A_guided_local_search_metaheuristic_for_the_team_orienteering_problem","abstract":"In the team orienteering problem (TOP) a set of locations is given, each with a score. The goal is to determine a fixed number of routes, limited in length, that visit some locations and maximise the sum of the collected scores. This paper describes an algorithm that combines different local search heuristics to solve the TOP. Guided local search (GLS) is used to improve two of the proposed heuristics. An extra heuristic is added to regularly diversify the search in order to explore more areas of the solution space. The algorithm is compared with the best known heuristics of the literature and applied on a large problem set. The obtained results are almost of the same quality as the results of these heuristics but the computational time is reduced significantly. Applying GLS to solve the TOP appears to be a very promising technique. Furthermore, the usefulness of exploring more areas of the solution space is clearly demonstrated.","authors":["Pieter Vansteenwegen","Wouter Souffriau","Greet Vanden Berghe","Dirk Van Oudheusden"],"meta":["July 2009European Journal of Operational Research 196(1):118-127","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2008.02.037"],"references":["345958701_Applying_an_Extended_Guided_Local_Search_to_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","309124071_The_orienteering_problem","255353181_Traveling_Salesman_Problems_With_Profits","230856233_Heuristic_Methods_Applied_to_Orienteering","220669191_Solving_the_Orienteering_Problem_through_Branch-and-Cut","220403497_Metaheuristics_for_the_team_orienteering_problem","2886283_Guided_Local_Search_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","2429351_Resource-Constrained_Geometric_Network_Optimization","313436512_The_mobile_tourist_guide_An_or_opportunity","230498603_A_Multifaceted_Heuristic_for_the_Orienteering_Problem","225438292_Variable_neighbourhood_search_Methods_and_applications","223691318_A_guided_local_search_heuristic_for_the_capacitated_arc_routing_problem","223241477_A_TABU_search_heuristic_for_the_team_orienteering_problem","222860033_The_team_orienteering_problem","222675552_A_vehicle_routing_problem_with_backhauls_and_time_windows_A_guided_local_search_solution","222502337_Guided_local_search_and_its_application_to_the_traveling_salesman_problem","222276237_Variable_neighborhood_search_Principles_and_applications","222236796_A_fast_and_effective_heuristic_for_the_orienteering_problem","221476238_An_Exact_Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Resource_Constrained_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Application_to_Scheduling_with_an_Aggregate_Deadline","220668789_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_the_Orienteering_Tour_Problem","220567912_The_Selective_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","220472874_An_Efficient_Four-Phase_Heuristic_for_the_Generalized_Orienteering_Problem","220472181_A_Heuristic_for_the_Multiple_Tour_Maximum_Collection_Problem","220438552_The_Mobile_Tourist_Guide_An_OR_Opportunity","220432537_Integer_Programming_Formulation_of_Traveling_Salesman_Problems","220209008_A_branch-and-cut_algorithm_for_the_undirected_selective_traveling_salesman_problem","200621988_The_Orienteering_Problem","35785110_Algorithms_and_solutions_to_multi-level_vehicle_routing_problems","4867012_A_Tabu_Search_heuristic_for_the_undirected_selective_traveling_salesman_problem"]}
