{"id":"277690945_De_Novo_Design_From_Models_to_Molecules","abstract":"Innovative bioactive agents fuel sustained drug discovery and the development of new medicines. Future success in chemical biology and pharmaceutical research alike will fundamentally rely on the combination of advanced synthetic and analytical technologies that are embedded in a theoretical framework that provides a rationale for the interplay between chemical structure and biological effect. A driving role in this setting falls on leading edge concepts in computer-assisted molecular design, by providing access to a virtually infinite source of novel druglike compounds and guiding experimental screening campaigns. In this chapter, we present concepts and ideas for the representation of molecular structure, suggest predictive models of structureâ€“activity relationships, and discuss approaches that have proved their usefulness and will contribute to future drug discovery by generating innovative bioactive agents. We also highlight some of the current prohibitive aspects of fully automated de novo design that will require attention for future methodological breakthroughs. This chapter provides an introduction to important pillars of de novo drug design, whereas the subsequent contributions presented in this book offer in-depth treatments of current trends, methods, and approaches together with numerous practical examples. We are confident that the reading will inspire.","authors":["Gisbert Schneider","Karl-Heinz Baringhaus"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1002/9783527677016.ch1","In book: De novo Molecular Design
