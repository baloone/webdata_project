{"id":"320651806_Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_Estimation_Using_a_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network","abstract":"Tropical cyclone intensity estimation is a challenging task as it required domain knowledge while extracting features, significant pre-processing, various sets of parameters obtained from satellites, and human intervention for analysis. The inconsistency of results, significant pre-processing of data, complexity of the problem domain, and problems on generalizability are some of the issues related to intensity estimation. In this study, we design a deep convolutional neural network architecture for categorizing hurricanes based on intensity using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Our model has achieved better accuracy and lower root-mean-square error by just using satellite images than ’state-of-the-art’ techniques. Visualizations of learned features at various layers and their deconvolutions are also presented for understanding the learning process.","authors":["Ritesh Pradhan","Ramazan Aygun","Manil Maskey","Rahul Ramachandran"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2017.2766358"],"references":["305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","279068412_Understanding_Neural_Networks_Through_Deep_Visualization","277411157_Deep_Learning","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","258724594_Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_Estimation_in_the_North_Atlantic_Basin_Using_an_Improved_Deviation_Angle_Variance_Technique","236076719_An_Evaluation_of_Dvorak_Technique-Based_Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_Estimates","228344387_High_Performance_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Document_Processing","224352977_Objective_Measures_of_Tropical_Cyclone_Structure_and_Intensity_Change_From_Remotely_Sensed_Infrared_Image_Data","221376179_Convolutional_Networks_and_Applications_in_Vision","220812758_Flexible_High_Performance_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","216792820_Convolutional_Networks_for_Images_Speech_and_Time-Series","215991023_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI","3857543_On_derivation_of_MLP_backpropagation_from_the_Kelley-Brysonoptimal-control_gradient_formula_and_its_application","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","319770305_Learning_Convolutional_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Visual_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","310467753_Reprocessing_the_Most_Intense_Historical_Tropical_Cyclones_in_the_Satellite_Era_Using_the_Advanced_Dvorak_Technique","299679657_Hierarchical_Representation_Using_NMF","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","286235371_Deep_Learning","284334506_Satellite-Derived_Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_in_the_North_Pacific_Ocean_Using_the_Deviation-Angle_Variance_Technique","267055959_Gradient_Theory_of_Optimal_Flight_Paths","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","258424423_Visualizing_and_Understanding_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","253222311_Estimating_Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_from_Infrared_Image_Data","241272511_Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_Analysis_and_Forecasting_from_Satellite_Imagery","216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition"]}
