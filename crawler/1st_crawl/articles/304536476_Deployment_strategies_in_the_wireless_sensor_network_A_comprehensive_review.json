{"id":"304536476_Deployment_strategies_in_the_wireless_sensor_network_A_comprehensive_review","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have come across several challenges such as node deployment, the reduction of power consumption, secure routing, bandwidth allocation, Quality of Service (QoS), and so forth. Since sensor deployment is an important matter due to its influence on cost and the network capability of WSN, the focus of this study is the deployment issue and related concerns such as coverage, connectivity, and energy efficiency, which have a great impact on the performance of WSNs. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that analyze and review the current scope completely. In this paper, some important research in the scope of sensor deployment will be investigated and analyzed as well as identifying their main specification. The deployment problem is classified based on few important factors and four deployment strategies and their related results are studied in each class. Also, the advantages and disadvantages along with important challenges of several strategies have been discussed so that more efficient deployment strategies can be developed in future.","authors":["Sanay Abdollahzadeh","Nima Jafari Navimipour"],"meta":["June 2016Computer Communications
