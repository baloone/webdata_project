{"id":"231365897_Tuning_PI_Controllers_For_Integrator_Dead_Time_Processes","abstract":"Chien and Fruehauf proposed an internal model control (IMC) approach to selecting the tuning constants for a PI controller in a process consisting of a pure integrator and a dead time. The only tuning parameter to be specified was the closed loop time constant. This paper points out that the IMC approach can lead to poor control unless care is taken in selecting the closed loop time constant. An alternative approach that avoids this problem is suggested. The proposed method uses classical frequency response methods. We show that there is a minimum reset time for the integrator/dead time process below which reasonable closed loop damping coefficients cannot be achieved. We also show that, for a given reset time, there is an optimum controller gain that minimizes the maximum closed loop log modulus. Equations for the calculation of the optimum reset time and the optimum gain of a PI controller for the control of an integrator/dead time process are developed.","authors":["Bjorn D.
