{"id":"225026502_Assessing_Computer_Education_in_Costa_Rica_Results_of_a_Supply_and_Demand_Study_of_ICT_Human_Resources","abstract":"In the last decade, Costa Rica has established a reputation for being a global provider of information and communication technology (ICT) products and services. Several important multinational companies have begun outsourcing operations in the country. In addition, a growing number of local firms have been created to provide ICT products and services worldwide. As a consequence, the country is experiencing a shortage of ICT qualified workers.\nTo understand the ICT human resource situation and improve the country’s capacity in computer education, a supply and demand study was conducted from 2007 to 2009. This paper presents the results of this study and its implications for the educational system. In addition, policy recommendations for computer education are proposed in order to support the country´s competiveness in the global ICT market and advances related to these recommendations are discussed.","authors":["Rosaura Matarrita","Francisco J.
