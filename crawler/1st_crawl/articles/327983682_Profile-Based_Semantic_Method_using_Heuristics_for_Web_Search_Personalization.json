{"id":"327983682_Profile-Based_Semantic_Method_using_Heuristics_for_Web_Search_Personalization","abstract":"User profiles play a critical role in personalizing user search. It assists search systems in retrieving relevant information that is searched on the web considering the user needs. Researchers presented a vast number of profile-based approaches that aims to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval. However, these approaches are syntactic-based which fail to achieve the user satisfaction. By the means that the search results do not meet user preferences, due to the fact that the search is keyword-based rather than semantic-based. Exploiting user profiles with the application of semantic web technology into personalization might produce a step forward in future retrieval systems. By adopting profiling approach and using ontology base characteristics, a semantic-based method using heuristics and KNN algorithm is proposed. It engages searching ontology base domains horizontally and vertically to discover and extract the closest concept to the meaning of the query keyword. The extracted concept is used to expand the user query to personalize the search result and present the customized information for individuals.
