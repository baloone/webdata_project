{"id":"224591557_Research_of_Automatic_Medical_Image_Segmentation_Algorithm_Based_on_Tsallis_Entropy_and_Improved_PCNN","abstract":"It needs set parameters on image segmentation based on PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) now. This paper points out the new method for medical image segmentation based on improved PCNN and Tsallis entropy. The new methods can automatically segment the medical images without selecting the PCNN parameters. It gets the best results with combining with the Tsallis entropy. The new method is very useful for PCNN application in the medical images segmentation.","authors":["Shi Weili","Miao Yu","Zhanfang Chen","Zhang Hongbiao"],"meta":["September 2009","DOI:10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246315","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Mechatronics and Automation, 2009.
