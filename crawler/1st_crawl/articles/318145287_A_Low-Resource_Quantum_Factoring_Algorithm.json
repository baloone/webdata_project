{"id":"318145287_A_Low-Resource_Quantum_Factoring_Algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, we present a factoring algorithm that, assuming standard heuristics, uses just \\((\\log N)^{2/3+o(1)}\\) qubits to factor an integer N in time \\(L^{q+o(1)}\\) where \\(L = \\exp ((\\log N)^{1/3}(\\log \\log N)^{2/3})\\) and \\(q=\\root 3 \\of {8/3}\\approx 1.387\\). For comparison, the lowest asymptotic time complexity for known pre-quantum factoring algorithms, assuming standard heuristics, is \\(L^{p+o(1)}\\) where \\(p>1.9\\). The new time complexity is asymptotically worse than Shor’s algorithm, but the qubit requirements are asymptotically better, so it may be possible to physically implement it sooner.","authors":["Daniel J.
