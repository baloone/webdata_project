{"id":"333182685_Number_of_Spanning_Trees_of_Cartesian_and_Composition_Products_of_Graphs_and_Chebyshev_Polynomials","abstract":"Enumerating all the spanning trees of a graph without duplication is one of the widely studied problem in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science literature. Since the number of spanning trees increases rapidly with the size of the graphs, a highly efficient method desired to compute all the spanning trees of a graph such as the method of eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix. In this paper, using a connection between the eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix and known properties of Chebyshev polynomials, we have explicit formulas for counting the number of spanning trees of Cartesian and Composition products of certain families graphs.","authors":["S.N.
