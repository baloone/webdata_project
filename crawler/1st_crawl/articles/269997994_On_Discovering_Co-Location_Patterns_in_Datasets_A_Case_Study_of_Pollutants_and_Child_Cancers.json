{"id":"269997994_On_Discovering_Co-Location_Patterns_in_Datasets_A_Case_Study_of_Pollutants_and_Child_Cancers","abstract":"We intend to identify relationships between cancer cases and pollutant\nemissions and attempt to understand whether cancer in children is typically\nlocated together with some specific chemical combinations or is independent.\nCo-location pattern analysis seems to be the appropriate investigation to\nperform. Co-location mining is one of the tasks of spatial data mining which\nfocuses on the detection of co-location patterns, the sets of spatial features\nfrequently located in close proximity of each other. Most previous works are\nbased on transaction-free apriori-like algorithms which are dependent on\nuser-defined thresholds and are designed for boolean data points. Due to the\nabsence of a clear notion of transactions, it is nontrivial to use association\nrule mining techniques to tackle the co-location mining problem. The approach\nwe propose is based on a grid \"transactionization\" of the geographic space and\nis designed to mine datasets with extended spatial objects. Uncertainty of the\nfeature presence in transactions is taken into account in our model. The\nstatistical test is used instead of global thresholds to detect significant\nco-location patterns and rules. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real\ndatasets. This approach can be used by researchers looking for spatial\nassociations between environmental and health factors. In addition, we explain\nthe data modelling framework which is used on real datasets of pollutants\n(PRTR/NPRI) and childhood cancer cases.","authors":["Jundong Li","Aibek Adilmagambetovm","Osmar R.
