{"id":"350034902_Repetitive_Control_Design_Based_on_Forwarding_for_Nonlinear_Minimum-Phase_Systems","abstract":"We propose a new design for a repetitive control scheme for nonlinear minimum-phase systems with arbitrary relative degree and globally Lipschitz nonlinearities. We represent the delay of the repetitive control scheme as a transport equation and we propose a new forwarding-based (partial) state-feedback design that uses not only the boundary information of the delay, but the entire state of the transport equation representing the delay. Through a rigorous mathematical analysis, we show that, from a theoretical point of view, asymptotic convergence of the desired regulated output can be achieved with the proposed control design.","authors":["Daniele Astolfi","Swann Marx","Nathan Van De Wouw"],"meta":["July 2021Automatica 129(16)","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2021.109671"],"references":["348462648_Forwarding_design_for_stabilization_of_a_coupled_transport_equation-ODE_with_a_cone-bounded_input_nonlinearity","334720515_Forwarding_stabilization_in_discrete_time","320385061_Cone-bounded_feedback_laws_for_m-dissipative_operators_on_Hilbert_spaces","342214674_L-asymptotic_stability_analysis_of_a_1D_wave_equation_with_a_nonlinear_damping","338089660_Francis-Wonham_nonlinear_viewpoint_in_output_regulation_of_minimum_phase_systems","337035115_Multivariable_Repetitive_Control_Decentralized_Designs_With_Application_to_Continuous_Media_Flow_Printing","335371004_A_Stability_Analysis_Based_on_Dissipativity_of_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Repetitive_Control","325914672_Stability_Analysis_of_Nonlinear_Repetitive_Control_Schemes","320956168_Multipattern_Output_Consensus_in_Networks_of_Heterogeneous_Nonlinear_Agents_With_Uncertain_Leader_A_Nonlinear_Regression_Approach","304411052_Approximate_regulation_for_nonlinear_systems_in_presence_of_periodic_disturbances"]}
