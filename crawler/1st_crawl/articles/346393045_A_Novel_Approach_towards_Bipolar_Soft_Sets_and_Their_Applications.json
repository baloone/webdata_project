{"id":"346393045_A_Novel_Approach_towards_Bipolar_Soft_Sets_and_Their_Applications","abstract":"The notion of bipolar soft sets has already been defined, but in this article, the notion of bipolar soft sets has been redefined, called T-bipolar soft sets. It is shown that the new approach is more close to the concept of bipolarity as compared to the previous ones, and further it is discussed that so far in the study of soft sets and their generalizations, the concept introduced in this manuscript has never been discussed earlier. We have also discussed the operational laws of T-bipolar soft sets and their basic properties. In the end, we have deliberated the algebraic structures associated with T-bipolar soft sets and the applications of T-bipolar soft sets in decision-making problems.","authors":["Tahir Mahmood"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Mathematics 2020(5):1-11","DOI:10.1155/2020/4690808"],"references":["337464281_STUDY_OF_FUZZY_SOFT_SETS_WITH_SOME_ORDER_ON_SET_OF_PARAMETERS","336700338_Contributions_to_the_Theory_of_Soft_Sets","334682859_Parameter_Reductions_of_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_with_Their_Decision-Making_Algorithms","329953142_Some_results_on_lattice_ordered_double_framed_soft_semirings","327652386_LATTICE_ORDERED_SOFT_NEAR_RINGS","327652370_A_New_Kind_of_Vector_Space_Soft_Vector_Space","327512386_Hybrid_models_for_decision-making_based_on_rough_Pythagorean_fuzzy_bipolar_soft_information","351262976_On_Lattice_Ordered_Double_Framed_Soft_Rings","334259569_Generalised_multi-fuzzy_bipolar_soft_sets_and_its_application_in_decision_making","333937943_A_decision_making_approach_based_on_multi-fuzzy_bipolar_soft_sets"]}
