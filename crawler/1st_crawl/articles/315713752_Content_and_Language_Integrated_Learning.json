{"id":"315713752_Content_and_Language_Integrated_Learning","abstract":"Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) is a dual-focused educational approach in which an additional language is used for the learning and teaching of both content and language. CLIL involves the use of language-supportive methodologies leading to authentic learning where attention is given to both the topic and the language of instruction. “Achieving this twofold aim calls for the development of a special approach to teaching, in that the nonlanguage subject is not taught in a foreign language but with and through a foreign language” (Eurydice, 2006, p. 8).\n\nKeywords:\n\nbilingualism;\nlanguage teaching;\nlanguage in the classroom;\nmethods;\nneurolinguistics;\nmultilingualism","authors":["David Marsh","María Jesús Frigols Martín"],"meta":["November 2012","DOI:10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal0190","In book: The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics"],"references":["282789282_CLIL_in_Spain_Implementation_Results_and_Teacher_Training","270815134_Tara_W_Fortune_and_Diane_J_Tedick_eds_Pathways_to_Multilingualism_Evolving_Perspectives_on_Immersion_Education","254327518_CLIL_Learning_Achievement_Levels_and_Affective_Factors","240792907_Foreign_Language_Competence_in_Content_and_Language_Integrated_Courses2008-03-282008-05-272008-06-11","229304969_Second-language_learning_and_changes_in_the_brain","344082758_Learning_and_Teaching_Languages_Through_Content_A_counterbalanced_approach","292428605_Content_and_language_integrated_learning_Evidence_from_research_in_Europe","290829114_CLIL_counterweights_recognising_and_decreasing_disjuncture_in_CLIL","281290451_English_Next_India","271104516_Foundations_of_Bilingual_Education_and_Bilingualism","271059039_Language_the_Learner_and_the_School","262450443_CLIL_Content_and_Language_Integrated_Learning","245578400_Awareness_of_Language_An_Introduction","237727297_Multilingualism_Cognition_and_Creativity","232904141_Towards_an_integrated_second-language_pedagogy_for_foreign_and_communityheritage_1_languages_in_multilingual_Britain","230140612_The_Impact_of_the_National_Child_Development_Study","227525581_New_Discoveries_From_the_Bilingual_Brain_and_Mind_Across_the_Life_Span_Implications_for_Education","8636266_Bilingual_corpus_callosum_variability","6394811_Who's_afraid_of_a_cognitive_neuroscience_of_creativity"]}
