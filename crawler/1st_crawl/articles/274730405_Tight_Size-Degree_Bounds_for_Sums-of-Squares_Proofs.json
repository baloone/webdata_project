{"id":"274730405_Tight_Size-Degree_Bounds_for_Sums-of-Squares_Proofs","abstract":"We exhibit families of $4$-CNF formulas over $n$ variables that have\nsums-of-squares (SOS) proofs of unsatisfiability of degree (a.k.a. rank) $d$\nbut require SOS proofs of size $n^{\\Omega(d)}$ for values of $d = d(n)$ from\nconstant all the way up to $n^{\\delta}$ for some universal constant$\\delta$.\nThis shows that the $n^{O(d)}$ running time obtained by using the Lasserre\nsemidefinite programming relaxations to find degree-$d$ SOS proofs is optimal\nup to constant factors in the exponent. We establish this result by combining\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-reductions expressible as low-degree SOS derivations with the\nidea of relativizing CNF formulas in [Kraj\\'i\\v{c}ek '04] and [Dantchev and\nRiis'03], and then applying a restriction argument as in [Atserias, M\\\"uller,\nand Oliva '13] and [Atserias, Lauria, and Nordstr\\\"om '14]. This yields a\ngeneric method of amplifying SOS degree lower bounds to size lower bounds, and\nalso generalizes the approach in [ALN14] to obtain size lower bounds for the\nproof systems resolution, polynomial calculus, and Sherali-Adams from lower\nbounds on width, degree, and rank, respectively.","authors":["Massimo Lauria","Jakob Nordstr√∂m"],"meta":["December 2017computational complexity 26(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-017-0152-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261469505_Lower_Bounds_for_DNF-refutations_of_a_Relativized_Weak_Pigeonhole_Principle","256079535_Linear_Lower_Bound_on_Degrees_of_Positivstellensatz_Calculus_Proofs_for_the_Parity","311694215_The_complexity_of_proving_that_a_graph_is_Ramsey","303571623_Parameterized_complexity_of_DPLL_search_procedures","303568359_Parameterized_Bounded-Depth_Frege_Is_not_Optimal","271468541_On_the_Power_of_Symmetric_LP_and_SDP_Relaxations","265511876_Narrow_Proofs_May_Be_Maximally_Long","261762020_Sum-of-squares_proofs_and_the_quest_toward_optimal_algorithms","258817343_The_Complexity_of_Proving_That_a_Graph_Is_Ramsey","258374140_Communication_Lower_Bounds_via_Critical_Block_Sensitivity","252239678_Complexity_of_Null-and_Positivstellensatz_Proofs","245015335_An_approach_to_obtaining_global_extrema_in_polynomial_mathematical_programming_problems","243767082_Squared_Functional_Systems_and_Optimization_Problems","242855762_Structured_Semidenite_Programs_and_Semialgebraic_Geometry_Methods_in_Robustness_and_Optimization","236203368_Relativisation_makes_contradictions_harder_for_Resolution"]}
