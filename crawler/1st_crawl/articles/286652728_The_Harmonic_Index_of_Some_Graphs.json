{"id":"286652728_The_Harmonic_Index_of_Some_Graphs","abstract":"The harmonic index of a graph G is defined as the sum of weights \\(\\frac{2}{d(u)+d(v)}\\) over all edges uv of G, where d(u) and d(v) are the degrees of the vertices u and v in G, respectively. Let \\(\\mathscr {T}(n,\\gamma )\\) and \\(\\mathscr {C}_n^\\pi \\) be the sets of trees of order n with domination number \\(\\gamma \\) and connected graphs of order n with degree sequence \\(\\pi \\), respectively. In this paper, the tree with minimum harmonic index among trees in \\(\\mathscr {T}(n,\\gamma )\\) is determined, as well as the trees with maximum harmonic index among trees in \\(\\mathscr {T}(n,\\gamma )\\) when \\(\\gamma =2,\\lceil \\frac{n}{3}\\rceil \\). Moreover, we show that among graphs in \\(\\mathscr {C}_n^\\pi \\), the maximum harmonic index is attained by a BFS graph.","authors":["Jianxi Li","Jian-Bo Lv","Yang Liu"],"meta":["December 2015The Bulletin of the Malaysian Mathematical Society Series 2 39(S1)","DOI:10.1007/s40840-015-0289-8"],"references":["287321822_The_harmonic_index_of_a_graph","270471024_A_lower_bound_for_the_harmonic_index_of_a_graph_with_minimum_degree_at_least_two","258199562_The_harmonic_index_of_unicyclic_graphs_with_given_matching_number","256848254_On_the_harmonic_index_and_the_matching_number_of_a_tree","253287647_The_Harmonic_Index_for_Bicyclic_Graphs","268606158_Bipartite_Graphs_with_the_Maximal_Value_of_the_Second_Zagreb_Index","267081399_A_survey_on_the_Randic_index","262408757_Note_On_the_harmonic_index_and_the_chromatic_number_of_a_graph","257934928_The_Harmonic_Index_on_Unicyclic_Graphs","253241219_A_survey_on_the_Randic_index"]}
