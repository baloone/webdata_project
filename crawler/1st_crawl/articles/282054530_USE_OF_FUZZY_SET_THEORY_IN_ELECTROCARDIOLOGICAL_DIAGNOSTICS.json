{"id":"282054530_USE_OF_FUZZY_SET_THEORY_IN_ELECTROCARDIOLOGICAL_DIAGNOSTICS","abstract":"The author has revised the first serious attempt of R. Degani and G. Pacini in order to use the framework of fuzzy set theory with respect to electrocardiological diagnostics. The basic idea of this revolutionary approach consists in following the current interpretation method used by physicians, namely, the use of linguistic terms, in order to describe the state and the utilities of the alternative pathologies. The problem of the final ranking of the alternatives has been solved using the fuzzy maximum operation constructed in accordance with Gaines' extension principle. Using this ranking method, results were obtained which deviate from the original ones of Degani and Pacini.","authors":["Etienne E. Kerre"],"meta":["January 1982"],"references":[]}
