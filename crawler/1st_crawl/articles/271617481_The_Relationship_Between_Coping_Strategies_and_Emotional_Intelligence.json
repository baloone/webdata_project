{"id":"271617481_The_Relationship_Between_Coping_Strategies_and_Emotional_Intelligence","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence and coping strategies. A total of 200 (96 females, 104 males) students from Razi university completed measures of emotional intelligence (TMMS) and Coping Responses Inventory (CRI). Data were analyzed using correlation coefficient and regression analysis. The results revealed significant relationship between emotional intelligence and each of the five items of coping strategies in CRI. In addition, regression analysis showed that, emotional intelligence can significantly predict each of these five coping strategies (problem-solving, social support seeking, cognitive evaluation, somatic inhibition and emotional inhibition). These results can be useful for prevention and treatment of behavioural and psychiatric disorder. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
