{"id":"220556368_On_the_stabbing_number_of_a_random_Delaunay_triangulation","abstract":"We consider a Delaunay triangulation dened on n points distributed independently and uniformly on a planar compact convex set of positive volume. Let the stabbing number be the maximal number of intersections between a line and edges of the triangulation. We show that the stabbing number Sn is ( p n) in the mean, and provide tail bounds for PfSn t p ng. Applications to planar point location, nearest neighbor searching, range queries, planar separator determination, approximate shortest paths, and the diameter of the Delaunay triangulation are discussed.","authors":["Prosenjit Bose","Luc Devroye"],"meta":["February 2007Computational Geometry 36(2):89-105","DOI:10.1016/j.comgeo.2006.05.005","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221590183_Primitives_for_the_Manipulation_of_General_Subdivisions_and_the_Computation_of_Voronoi_Diagrams","220669978_The_expected_extremes_in_a_Delaunay_triangulation","220492503_Optimal_Expected-Time_Algorithms_for_Closest_Point_Problems","285511207_Handbook_of_discrete_and_computational_geometry","280688957_Delaunay_graphs_are_almost_as_good_as_complete_graphs","279043538_Applications_of_a_Planar_Separator_Theorem","266354976_Concentration","266060032_Beyond_the_method_of_bounded_differences","262203018_Point_Location","262090816_A_Handbook_of_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures","261179979_Introduction_to_Algorithms_Third_Edition","248413997_Weighted_sums_of_certain_dependent_variables","247827897_The_degree_sequence_of_a_random_graph","247572109_Software_for_C1_Surface_Interpolation","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","242609100_Triangulation_de_Delaunay_et_maillage","242594582_Complexity_issues_in_VLSI","242419083_Computing_Dirichlet_Tesselations_in_the_Plane","236736804_On_the_method_of_bounded_differences","236496932_Area-efficient_VLSI_computation","235127121_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","234811237_Handbook_of_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures","230596035_A_Separator_Theorem_for_Planar_Graphs","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","227268813_The_analysis_of_a_nested_dissection_algorithm","226966942_Online_Routing_in_Triangulations","225638772_Sharp_concentration_of_the_chromatic_number_on_random_graphsGn_p","222881949_Intersections_with_random_geometric_objects","222546692_Expected_time_analysis_for_Delaunay_point_location","221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","221590798_Faster_shortest-path_algorithms_for_planar_graphs","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","220574043_Fast_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Hamiltonian_Circuits_and_Matchings","220573304_Faster_Shortest-Path_Algorithms_for_Planar_Graphs","220566333_Geometric_Range_Searching","220424200_Multidimensional_Binary_Search_Trees_Used_for_Associative_Searching_Communications_of_the_ACM_189_509-517","220345650_The_degree_sequence_of_a_random_graph_I_The_models","220345377_The_Transitive_Closure_of_a_Random_Digraph","38370094_Weighted_sums_of_certain_dependent_variables","38349465_On_the_size_of_a_random_sphere_of_influence_graph","34642257_Graph_separator_theorems_and_sparse_Gaussian_elimination","31048548_Computing_Dirichlet_Tessellations_in_the_Plane","30867879_Multidimensional_Binary_Search_Trees_Used_for_Associative_Searching","4355154_Delaunay_graphs_are_almost_as_good_as_complete_graphs","4354716_Applications_of_a_Planar_Separator_Theorem","2792856_Closest-Point_Problems_in_Computational_Geometry","2426605_Online_Routing_in_Triangulations"]}
