{"id":"316938260_Geographic_information_science_I_Geographic_information_observatories_and_opportunistic_GIScience","abstract":"Geographic information observatories (GIOs) extend the capabilities for observatory-based science to the broad geographic data associated with a place or region. GIOs are a form of scientific instrumentation that affords a holistic view of geographic data. This potentially could lead to new insights about geographic information, as well as the human and coupled human-natural systems described by this information. In this report, I discuss GIOs in light of a timely question â€“ what new types of GIScience should we be doing with big geographic data? I argue that GIOs also allow for a new type of opportunistic geographic information science that leverages real-world events via ongoing observation, experimentation and decision-support.","authors":["Harvey Miller"],"meta":["May 2017Progress in Human Geography 41(4):030913251771074","DOI:10.1177/0309132517710741","Project: PiHG GIS updates"],"references":["288482773_Geographic_information_observatories_for_supporting_science","282538532_Data-driven_geography","279956978_The_Web_Observatory_A_Middle_Layer_for_Broad_Data","279210353_POI_Pulse_A_Multi-granular_Semantic_Signature-Based_Information_Observatory_for_the_Interactive_Visualization_of_Big_Geosocial_Data","271132061_Knowing_and_governing_cities_through_urban_indicators_city_benchmarking_and_real-time_dashboards","269763850_Towards_Geographic_Information_Observatories","261645421_The_Integration_of_Geographic_Visualization_with_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Databases_and_Geocomputation","260808437_Relation_Between_Higher_Physical_Activity_and_Public_Transit_Use","260304852_The_Web_Science_Observatory","236648859_Seafloor_Observatory_Science_a_Review","200621956_Spatial_decision_support_systems","10800816_What_Is_a_public_health_observatory","7323610_Learning_from_Evidence_in_a_Complex_World","5970448_Complexity_of_Coupled_Human_and_Natural_Systems","331648778_The_role_of_volcano_observatories_in_risk_reduction","318494418_The_Computational_Beauty_of_Nature_Computer_Explorations_of_Fractals_Chaos_Complex_Systems_and_Adaptation","312877025_The_Web_Science_Observatory_-_The_Challenges_of_Analytics_over_Distributed_Linked_Data_Infrastructures","312632715_Observlets_Empowering_Analytical_Observations_on_Web_Observatory","309823037_Natural_and_Quasi-Experiments_in_Economics","308861136_Big_Data_for_Healthy_Cities_Using_Location-Aware_Technologies_Open_Data_and_3D_Urban_Models_to_Design_Healthier_Built_Environments","307589401_Spatial_Simulation_Exploring_Pattern_and_Process","303557374_CAN_NEW_LIGHT_RAIL_REDUCE_PERSONAL_VEHICLE_CARBON_EMISSIONS_A_BEFORE-AFTER_EXPERIMENTAL-CONTROL_EVALUATION_IN_LOS_ANGELES_LIGHT_RAIL_AND_CO_2_EMISSIONS","302205066_Planning_an_Observational_Study","299346879_Opportunistic_natural_experiments_using_digital_telemetry_a_transit_disruption_case_study","298727872_Policy_Urban_physics","290614953_Visual_Exploration_and_Explanation_in_Geography_Analysis_with_Light","282469635_Building_a_Real-Time_Web_Observatory","281512718_Public_transit_generates_new_physical_activity_Evidence_from_individual_GPS_and_accelerometer_data_before_and_after_light_rail_construction_in_a_neighborhood_of_Salt_Lake_City_Utah_USA","276433449_Cities_of_Data_Examining_the_New_Urban_Science","276359103_Transit_Use_Physical_Activity_and_Body_Mass_Index_Changes_Objective_Measures_Associated_With_Complete_Street_Light-Rail_Construction","275206750_Broad_Data_Exploring_the_Emerging_Web_of_Data","274872012_Beyond_sharing_Cultivating_cooperative_transportation_systems_through_geographic_information_science","261959158_7_Billion_Home_Telescopes_Observing_Social_Machines_through_Personal_Data_Stores","260809605_The_Parable_of_Google_Flu_Traps_in_Big_Data_Analysis","257582087_Web_evolution_and_Web_Science","256054458_Social_Science_in_the_Era_of_Big_Data","249734334_The_Urban_Observatory_Approach_A_Decade_of_Conceptual_ization_and_Experimentation","235674676_Cities_of_Tomorrow","229785648_The_Validity_and_Usefulness_of_Laws_in_Geographic_Information_Science_and_Geography","229696361_Evaluation_Policy_Learning_and_Evidence-Based_Policy_Making","228034112_Observational_Study","227988749_GIScience_Geography_Form_and_Process","227601455_Complexity_science_and_human_geography","222751939_The_Social_Observatory_Time_Series_Data_for_Health_and_Behavioral_Research","222557467_Simplifying_Complexity_a_Review_of_Complexity_Theory","222402715_Correlation_or_Causality_Between_the_Built_Environment_and_Travel_Behavior_Evidence_from_Northern_California","220689647_Abductive_Reasoning","37419834_Research_Initiative_6_Spatial_Decision_Support_Systems_Closing_Report","36816961_Mirror_worlds_or_the_day_software_puts_the_universe_in_a_shoebox_how_it_will_happen_and_what_it_will_mean"]}
