In this study, the relationship between various metrics of\n63,805 PLOS research articles are studied. Generally, article views correlate\nwell with citation, however, different types of article view have different\nlevels of correlation with citation, when pdf download correlates the citation\nmost significantly. It's necessary for publishers and journals to provide\ndetailed and comprehensive article metrics. Although the low correlation\nbetween social attention and citation is confirmed by this study and previous\nstudies, more than ever, we find that social attention is highly correlated\nwith article view, especially the browser html view. Social attention is the\nimportant source that bringing network traffic to browser html view and may\nlead to citation subsequently. High altmetric score has the potential role in\npromoting the long-term academic impact of articles, when a conceptual model is\nproposed to interpret the conversion from social attention to article view, and\nto citation finally.","authors":["Xianwen Wang","Chen Liu","Zhichao Fang","Wenli Mao"],"meta":["September 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["286021836_Correction_Can_Tweets_Predict_Citations_Metrics_of_Social_Impact_Based_on_Twitter_and_Correlation_with_Traditional_Metrics_of_Scientific_Impact","257662983_Validating_Online_Reference_Managers_for_Scholarly_Impact_Measurement","250926321_Social_Media_Release_Increases_Dissemination_of_Original_Articles_in_the_Clinical_Pain_Sciences","236978654_Do_Altmetrics_Work_Twitter_and_Ten_Other_Social_Web_Services","236455949_Usage_History_of_Scientific_Literature_Nature_Metrics_and_Metrics_of_Nature_Publications","261855483_Evaluating_altmetric","255704500_Tweeting_Biomedicine_An_Analysis_of_Tweets_and_Citations_in_the_Biomedical_Literature","253239383_How_far_does_scientific_community_look_back","245604402_Comparing_citations_and_downloads_for_individual_articles_at_the_Journal_of_Vision","243459112_Exploring_scientists'_working_timetable_A_global_survey","232975512_How_the_Scientific_Community_Reacts_to_Newly_Submitted_Preprints_Article_Downloads_Twitter_Mentions_and_Citations","230613690_Tracing_scientist's_research_trends_realtimely","232764964_Article_downloads_and_citations_Is_there_any_relationship","230666845_Exploring_scientists'_working_timetable_Do_scientists_often_workovertime","227675818_How_and_why_scholars_cite_on_Twitter"]}
