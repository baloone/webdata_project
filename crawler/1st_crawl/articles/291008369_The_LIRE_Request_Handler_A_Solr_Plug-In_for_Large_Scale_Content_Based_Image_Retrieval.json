{"id":"291008369_The_LIRE_Request_Handler_A_Solr_Plug-In_for_Large_Scale_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval","abstract":"Big data in the visual domain and large scale image retrieval are current and pressing topics. In this demo paper we describe a specific implementation, that allows for large scale content based image retrieval using the Apache Solr search server. The combination of the robust and well accepted Apache Solr search server with the LIRE content based search framework provides an easy to use and well performing combination of two popular open source tools. We demonstrate the usefulness of our plug-in based the a real life scenario of visual trademark search with more than 1,800,000 images.","authors":["Mathias Lux","Glenn MacStravic"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-04117-9_39","Conference: International Conference on Multimedia Modeling"],"references":["235169903_Multimedia_Information_Systems","221573704_OpenIMAJ_and_ImageTerrier_Java_Libraries_and_Tools_for_Scalable_Multimedia_Analysis_and_Indexing_of_Images","33040041_Multimedia_information_retrieval_new_challenges_in_audio_visual_search_Workshop_Report","8664797_A_Review_of_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval_Systems_in_Medical_Applications_-_Clinical_Benefits_and_Future_Directions","277460483_Image_retrieval","262312450_LIRE_open_source_image_retrieval_in_Java"]}
