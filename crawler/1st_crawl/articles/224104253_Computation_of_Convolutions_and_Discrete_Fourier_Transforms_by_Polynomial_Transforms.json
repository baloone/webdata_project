{"id":"224104253_Computation_of_Convolutions_and_Discrete_Fourier_Transforms_by_Polynomial_Transforms","abstract":"The calculation of two-dimensional digital convolutions has many applications, particularly in image processing. The main problem associated with these convolutions relates to processing load required for their computation. In this article discrete transforms are introduced and defined in a ring of polynomials. These polynomial transforms are shown to have the convolution property and can be computed in ordinary arithmetic, without multiplications. Polynomial transforms are particularly well suited for computing discrete two-dimensional convolutions with a minimum number of operations. Efficient algorithms for computing one-dimensional convolutions and Discrete Fourier Transforms are then derived from polynomial transforms.","authors":["Henri Nussbaumer","Philippe Quandalle"],"meta":["April 1978Ibm Journal of Research and Development 22(2):134 - 144","DOI:10.1147/rd.222.0134","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["313449340_On_computing_the_discrete_Fourier_transform","269888928_Introduction_to_Number_Theory","265358731_Introduction_to_Number_Theory","247878188_The_Fast_Fourier_Transform_in_a_Finite_Field","246983745_Number_Theoretic_Trans-formsto_Implement_Fast_Digital_Convolution","239513164_Discrete_Convolution_via_Mersenne_Transforms","229099884_An_Algorithm_for_the_Machine_Calculation_of_Complex_Fourier_Series","224738109_A_method_for_programming_the_complex_general-N_Winograd_Fourier_transform_algorithm","224104367_Complex_Convolution_via_Fermat_Number_Transforms","224104350_Digital_Filtering_Using_Complex_Mersenne_Transforms","215458980_An_Algorithm_for_the_Machine_Computation_of_Complex_Fourier_Series","7188419_On_Computing_the_Discrete_Fourier_Transform","3999681_New_algorithms_for_digital_convolution","3999652_A_new_method_for_computing_DFT","3400312_Digital_filtering_using_polynomial_transforms","3184761_On_the_Application_of_the_Number_Theoretic_Methods_of_High-Speed_Convolution_to_Two-Dimensional_Filtering","3175964_Fast_One-Dimensional_Digital_Convolution_by_Multidimensional_Techniques","3045597_The_Relationship_Between_Two_Fast_Fourier_Transforms","2994052_Number_Theoretic_Transforms_to_Implement_Fast_Digital_Convolution","2990882_Discrete_Fourier_Transforms_When_the_Number_of_Data_Samples_Is_Prime"]}
