{"id":"328085977_Ear_recognition_using_local_binary_patterns_A_comparative_experimental_study","abstract":"Identity recognition using local features extracted from ear images has recently attracted a great deal of attention in the intelligent biometric systems community. The rich and reliable information of the human ear and its stable structure over a long period of time present ear recognition technology as an appealing choice for identifying individuals and verifying their identities. This paper considers the ear recognition problem using local binary patterns (LBP) features. Where, the LBP-like features characterize the spatial structure of the image texture based on the assumption that this texture has a pattern and its strength (amplitude)-two locally complementary aspects. Their high discriminative power, invariance to monotonic gray-scale changes and computational efficiency properties make the LBP-like features suitable for the ear recognition problem. Thus, the performance of several recent LBP variants introduced in the literature as feature extraction techniques is investigated to determine how they can be best utilized for ear recognition. To this end, we carry out a comprehensive comparative study on the identification and verification scenarios separately. Besides, a new variant of the traditional LBP operator named averaged local binary patterns (ALBP) is proposed and its ability in representing texture of ear images is compared with the other LBP variants. The ear identification and verification experiments are extensively conducted on five publicly available constrained and unconstrained benchmark ear datasets stressing various imaging conditions; namely IIT Delhi -I, IIT Delhi-II, AMI, WPUT and AWE. The obtained results for both identification and verification indicate that the current LBP texture descriptors are successful feature extraction candidates for ear recognition systems in the case of constrained imaging conditions and can achieve recognition rates reaching up to 99%; while, their performance faces difficulties when the level of distortions increases. Moreover, it is noted that the tested LBP variants achieve almost close performance on ear recognition. Thus, further studies on other applications are needed to verify this close performance. We believe that the presented study has significant insights and can benefit researchers in choosing between LBP variants as well as acting as a connection between previous studies and future work in utilizing LBP-like features in ear recognition systems.","authors":["Mahmoud Hassaballah","Hammam Alshazly","Abdelmgeid A.
