{"id":"322371625_A_Practical_Approach_to_Measuring_User_Engagement_with_the_Refined_User_Engagement_Scale_UES_and_New_UES_Short_Form","abstract":"User engagement (UE) and its measurement have been of increasing interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). The User Engagement Scale (UES) is one tool developed to measure UE, and has been used in a variety of digital domains. The original UES consisted of 31-items and purported to measure six dimensions of engagement: aesthetic appeal, focused attention, novelty, perceived usability, felt involvement, and endurability. A recent synthesis of the literature questioned the original six-factors. Further, the ways in which the UES has been implemented in studies suggests there may be a need for a briefer version of the questionnaire and more effective documentation to guide its use and analysis. This research investigated and verified a four-factor structure of the UES and proposed a Short Form (SF). We employed contemporary statistical tools that were unavailable during the UESâ€™ development to re-analyze the original data, consisting of 427 and 779 valid responses across two studies, and examined new data (N=344) gathered as part of a three-year digital library project. In this paper we detail our analyses, present a revised long and short form (SF) version of the UES, and offer guidance for researchers interested in adopting the UES and UES-SF in their own studies.","authors":["Heather Lynn O'Brien","Paul Antony Cairns","Mark Hall"],"meta":["April 2018International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 112","DOI:10.1016/j.ijhcs.2018.01.004"],"references":["306363686_Overview_of_the_CLEF_2016_Social_Book_Search_Lab","319893008_Antecedents_and_learning_outcomes_of_online_news_engagement","316551631_Why_engagement_matters_Cross-disciplinary_perspectives_of_user_engagement_in_digital_media","314290789_Asking_Good_Questions_Questionnaire_Design_and_Analysis_in_Interactive_Information_Retrieval_Research","313407197_Using_multi-channel_data_with_multi-level_modeling_to_assess_in-game_performance_during_gameplay_with_Crystal_Island","311945361_What_makes_online_news_interesting_Personal_and_situational_interest_and_the_effect_on_behavioral_intentions","304618825_Engaged_or_Frustrated_Disambiguating_engagement_and_frustration_in_search","303688896_Theoretical_Perspectives_on_User_Engagement","303571238_Is_there_a_universal_instrument_for_measuring_Interactive_Information_Retrieval_The_case_of_the_User_Engagement_Scale","298092678_Scale_development_theory_and_applications_applied_social_research_methods_Sage_Publications"]}
