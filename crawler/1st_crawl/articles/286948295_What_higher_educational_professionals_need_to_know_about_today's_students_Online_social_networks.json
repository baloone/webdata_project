{"id":"286948295_What_higher_educational_professionals_need_to_know_about_today's_students_Online_social_networks","abstract":"In this study, the author specifically focused on the most popular social media website-Facebook-and investigated the nature of student learning engagement associated with Facebook activity. Data pertaining to student Facebook use and activities were collected. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to measure the relationships between Facebook instructional methods and grades. A linear regression was also performed to analyze the predictors of student grades. An empirical study of Facebook users (n= 134) during the 2011-2012 academic year revealed that course-based Facebook use had a significant positive effect on student learning engagement and grades. This study concludes that Facebook use in instruction assists students in achieving better grades, higher engagement, and greater satisfaction with the university learning experience. Thus, the author recommends the use of Facebook as an educational communication and interaction tool to enable faculty to assume a more active and participatory role in teaching and learning.","authors":["J.
