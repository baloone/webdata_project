{"id":"317272167_Exploring_new_formats_of_the_Self-Assessment_Manikin_in_the_design_with_children","abstract":"Lang and Bradley's Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) is an assessment tool that has been successfully used in different areas to elicit the affective responses in the three levels of valence, excitement and dominance. The pictographic format of this instrument makes it accessible for those with low literacy skills, including children and the elderly. In this article, we report and discuss our experiences using SAM and we present the adaptations made to SAM along a process that originated new formats of SAM, used in design practices with children.","authors":["Elaine Hayashi","Julián Esteban Gutiérrez Posada","Vanessa Regina Margareth Lima Maike","M.
