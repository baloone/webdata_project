{"id":"347138580_Hybrid_approximation_for_solutions_of_high-order_integro-differential_equations_including_variable_delay","abstract":"In this study, a numerical technique with hybrid approximation is developed for solving high-order linear integro-differential equations including variable delay under the initial conditions. These type of problems are of applications in mathematical physics, mechanics, natural sciences, electronics and computer science. The aim of this work is to investigate an approximation with the matrix forms of Taylor and Laguerre polynomials along with standard collocation points. By the reduction of the solution of this problem with regard to the matrix relations, the solution of a system of algebraic equations has been obtained. The usefulness of this algorithm has been demonstrated by numerical experiments together with an error analysis technique.","authors":["Burcu Gürbüz"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1641(1):012062","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1641/1/012062"],"references":["336646280_On_some_comparison_of_the_multistep_hybrid_methods_and_their_application_solving_of_the_Volterra_integro-differential_equations","320320539_Laguerre_Polynomial_Solutions_of_a_Class_of_Delay_Partial_Functional_Differential_Equations","335465481_Laguerre_polynomial_approach_for_solving_Lane-Emden_type_functional_differential_equations","334148484_Galerkin_method_with_new_quadratic_spline_wavelets_for_integral_and_integro-differential_equations","257194451_Recent_advances_in_the_numerical_analysis_of_Volterra_functional_differential_equations_with_variable_delays","222218777_Asymptotic_behavior_of_solutions_to_a_first-order_differential_equation_with_variable_delays","220179921_Optimal_Superconvergence_Results_for_Delay_Integro-Differential_Equations_of_Pantograph_Type"]}
