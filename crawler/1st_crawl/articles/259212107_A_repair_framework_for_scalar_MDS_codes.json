{"id":"259212107_A_repair_framework_for_scalar_MDS_codes","abstract":"Several works have developed vector-linear maximum-distance separable (MDS)\nstorage codes that min- imize the total communication cost required to repair a\nsingle coded symbol after an erasure, referred to as repair bandwidth (BW).\nVector codes allow communicating fewer sub-symbols per node, instead of the\nentire content. This allows non trivial savings in repair BW. In sharp\ncontrast, classic codes, like Reed- Solomon (RS), used in current storage\nsystems, are deemed to suffer from naive repair, i.e. downloading the entire\nstored message to repair one failed node. This mainly happens because they are\nscalar-linear. In this work, we present a simple framework that treats scalar\ncodes as vector-linear. In some cases, this allows significant savings in\nrepair BW. We show that vectorized scalar codes exhibit properties that\nsimplify the design of repair schemes. Our framework can be seen as a finite\nfield analogue of real interference alignment. Using our simplified framework,\nwe design a scheme that we call clique-repair which provably identifies the\nbest linear repair strategy for any scalar 2-parity MDS code, under some\nconditions on the sub-field chosen for vectorization. We specify optimal repair\nschemes for specific (5,3)- and (6,4)-Reed- Solomon (RS) codes. Further, we\npresent a repair strategy for the RS code currently deployed in the Facebook\nAnalytics Hadoop cluster that leads to 20% of repair BW savings over naive\nrepair which is the repair scheme currently used for this code.","authors":["Karthikeyan Shanmugam","Dimitris S.
