{"id":"225045184_Galois_Field_Quantum_Mechanics","abstract":"We construct a discrete quantum mechanics using a vector space over the\nGalois field GF(q). We find that the correlations in our model do not violate\nthe Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) version of Bell's inequality, despite the\nfact that the predictions of this discrete quantum mechanics cannot be\nreproduced with any hidden variable theory.","authors":["Lay Chang","Zachary Lewis","Djordje Minic","Tatsu Takeuchi"],"meta":["May 2012Modern Physics Letters B 27(10)","DOI:10.1142/S0217984913500644","SourcearXiv"],"references":["253153674_An_Introduction_to_Finite_Geometry","289914904_Field_Theory_of_Galois'_Fields","267093645_Algebraic_Curves_Over_a_Finite_Field","266936197_Quantum_Theory_in_real_Hilbert-Space","265374085_Projective_Geometries_Over_Finite_Fields","265033988_Dynamics_Statistics_and_Projective_Geometry_of_Galois_Fields","253523503_Bell's_theorem_without_inequalities","247316361_Quantum_Field_Theory_and_Parastatistics","241518264_Quaternionic_Quantum_Mechanics_and_Quantum_Fields","231050029_Quantum_systems_with_finite_Hilbert_space_Galois_fields_in_quantum_mechanics"]}
