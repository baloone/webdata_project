{"id":"342452008_Guide_to_the_Software_Engineering_Body_of_Knowledge_-_SWEBOK_V30","abstract":"In the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK® Guide), the IEEE Computer Society establishes a baseline for the body of knowledge for the field of software engineering, and the work supports the Society’s responsibility to promote the advancement of both theory and practice in this field. It should be noted that the Guide does not purport to define the body of knowledge but rather to serve as a compendium and guide to the knowledge that has been developing and evolving over the past four decades. Now in Version 3.0, the Guide’s 15 knowledge areas summarize generally accepted topics and list references for detailed information.\n\nThe editors for Version 3.0 of the SWEBOK® Guide are Pierre Bourque (École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), Université du Québec) and Richard E. (Dick) Fairley (Software and Systems Engineering Associates (S2EA)).","authors":["Pierre Bourque","R.E.
