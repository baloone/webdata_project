{"id":"354862973_Exact_Methods_and_Heuristics_for_Order_Acceptance_Scheduling_Problem_under_Time-of-Use_Costs_and_Carbon_Emissions","abstract":"This research focuses on an Order Acceptance Scheduling (OAS) problem on a single machine under time-of-use (TOU) tariffs and taxed carbon emissions periods with the objective to maximize total profit minus tardiness penalties and environmental costs. Due to the NP-hardness of the considered problem especially in presence of sequence-dependent setup-times, two fix-and-relax (FR) heuristics based on different time-indexed (TI) formulations are proposed. A metaheuristic based on the Dynamic Island Model (DIM) framework is also employed to tackle this optimization problem. These approached methods show promising results both in terms of solution quality and solving time compared to state-of-the-art exact solving approaches.","authors":["Mariam Bouzid","Oussama Masmoudi","Alice Yalaoui"],"meta":["September 2021Applied Sciences 11(19):8919","DOI:10.3390/app11198919","Project: Scheduling with energy aspects"],"references":["349039186_Time-indexed_formulations_for_the_Order_Acceptance_Scheduling_problem_under_energy_aspects","344740015_Industry_40_Revolution_or_Evolution","343485814_Reinforcement_Learning_Algorithms_for_Online_Single-Machine_Scheduling","343376652_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization_for_Production_Rescheduling_in_Industry_40","337052539_A_fix-and-relax_heuristic_for_the_single-item_lot-sizing_problem_with_a_flow-shop_system_and_energy_constraints","336175208_Order_Acceptance_and_Scheduling_Problem_with_Carbon_Emission_Reduction_and_Electricity_Tariffs_on_a_Single_Machine","335726808_A_review_of_energy-efficient_scheduling_in_intelligent_production_systems","355033446_Optimisation_de_la_planification_des_systemes_industriels_en_presence_de_contraintes_energetiques","352439522_Generalized_order_acceptance_and_scheduling_problem_with_batch_delivery_Models_and_metaheuristics","337419828_Green_manufacturing_Order_acceptance_and_scheduling_subject_to_the_budgets_of_energy_consumption_and_machine_launch","331713233_Complexity_analysis_of_energy-efficient_single_machine_scheduling_problems","333645466_Order_Acceptance_and_Scheduling_Problem_A_Proposed_Formulation_and_the_Comparison_with_the_Literature","333055965_The_impact_of_various_carbon_reduction_policies_on_green_flowshop_scheduling","332344652_Multi-objective_optimization_for_energy-efficient_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem_with_transportation_constraints","331781939_Modeling_and_solving_a_sugarcane_harvest_front_scheduling_problem"]}
