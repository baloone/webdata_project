{"id":"320987679_Structural_Dynamics_and_Resilience_in_Supply_Chain_Risk_Management","abstract":"This book offers an introduction to structural dynamics, ripple effect and resilience in supply chain disruption risk management for larger audiences. In the management section, without relying heavily on mathematical derivations, the book offers state-of-the-art concepts and methods to tackle supply chain disruption risks and designing resilient supply chains in a simple, predictable format to make it easy to understand for students and professionals with both management and engineering background.\n\nIn the technical section, the book constitutes structural dynamics control methods for supply chain management. Real-life problems are modelled and solved with the help of mathematical programming, discrete-event simulation, optimal control theory, and fuzzy logic.\n\nThe book derives practical recommendations for management decision-making with disruption risk in the following areas:\n\nHow to estimate the impact of possible disruptions on performance in the pro-active stage?\nHow to generate efficient and effective stabilization and recovery policies?\nWhen does one failure trigger an adjacent set of failures?\nWhich supply chain structures are particular sensitive to ripple effect?\nHow to measure the disruption risks in the supply chain?","authors":["Dmitry Ivanov"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-69305-7","Publisher: SpringerISBN: 978-3-319-69305-7","Project: Ripple effect in the supply chain"],"references":["283274831_Identifying_Risks_and_Mitigating_Disruptions_in_the_Automotive_Supply_Chain","271101269_A_dynamic_model_and_an_algorithm_for_short-term_supply_chain_scheduling_in_the_smart_factory_industry_40","321568632_Optimal_Control_Theory_Applications_to_Management_Science_and_Economics","313203353_The_architecture_of_complexity","303577409_Designing_Value-Creating_Supply_Chain_Networks","291421524_Robust_global_supply_chain_network_design_under_disruption_and_uncertainty_considering_resilience_strategies_A_parallel_memetic_algorithm_for_a_real-life_case_study","284438995_Connectivity_Complexity_and_Catastrophe_in_Large-Scale_Systems","266719402_Dynamic_model_and_optimal_scheduling_algorithm_for_a_set_of_jobs_with_preemption_constraints","265764955_Conceptual_foundations_of_quality_estimation_and_analysis_for_models_and_multiple-model_systems","258100640_General_Systems_Theory_Mathematical_Foundations","257651324_Supply_Chain_Engineering_Useful_Methods_and_Techniques","257552246_On_Applicability_of_Optimal_Control_Theory_to_Adaptive_Supply_Chain_Planning_and_Scheduling","256672885_Supply_chain_lessons_from_the_catastrophic_natural_disaster_in_Japan","256006637_Researchers'_Perspectives_on_Supply_Chain_Risk_Management","247674858_Supply-Chain_Management_Logistics_Catches_up_with_Strategy"]}
