{"id":"272422763_Explaining_robust_additive_utility_models_by_sequences_of_preference_swaps","abstract":"Multicriteria decision analysis aims at supporting a person facing a decision\nproblem involving conflicting criteria. We consider an additive utility model\nwhich provides robust conclusions based on preferences elicited from the\ndecision maker. The recommendations based on these robust conclusions are even\nmore convincing if they are complemented by explanations. We propose a general\nscheme, based on sequence of preference swaps, in which explanations can be\ncomputed. We show first that the length of explanations can be unbounded in the\ngeneral case. However, in the case of binary reference scales, this length is\nbounded and we provide an algorithm to compute the corresponding explanation.","authors":["Khaled Belahcene","Christophe Labreuche","Nicolas Maudet","Vincent Mousseau"],"meta":["February 2017Theory and Decision 82(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11238-016-9560-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["313605777_Robust_ordinal_regression","258834018_Preference_inference_with_general_additive_value_models_and_holistic_pair-wise_statements","304116307_Chapter_1_Introduction","288052916_Pattern-based_explanation_for_automated_decisions","273944815_Foundations_of_Measurement","266963438_General_overview_of_the_MACBETH_approach","264960665_Nonlinear_Programming","262240613_Some_problems_in_testing_the_double_cancellation_condition_in_conjoint_measurement","243778335_For_Argument''s_Sake_A_Guide_to_Writing_Effective_Arguments","243778004_Decision_Analytic_Intelligent_Systems_Automated_Explanation_and_Knowledge_Acquisition"]}
