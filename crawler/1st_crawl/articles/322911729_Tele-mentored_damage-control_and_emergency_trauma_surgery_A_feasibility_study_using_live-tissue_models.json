{"id":"322911729_Tele-mentored_damage-control_and_emergency_trauma_surgery_A_feasibility_study_using_live-tissue_models","abstract":"Background: \nDamage-control and emergency surgical procedures in trauma have the potential to save lives. They may occasionally not be performed due to clinician inexperience or lack of comfort and knowledge.\n\nMethods: \nCanadian Armed Forces (CAF) non-surgeon Medical Officers (MOs) participated in a live tissue training exercise. They received tele-mentoring assistance using a secure video-conferencing application on a smartphone/tablet platform. Feasibility of tele-mentored surgery was studied by measuring their effectiveness at completing a set series of tasks in this pilot study. Additionally, their comfort and willingness to perform studied procedures was gauged using pre- and post-study surveys.\n\nResults: \nWith no pre-procedural teaching, participants were able to complete surgical airway, chest tube insertion and resuscitative thoracotomy with 100% effectiveness with no noted complications. Comfort level and willingness to perform these procedures were improved with tele-mentoring. Participants felt that tele-mentored surgery would benefit their performance of resuscitative thoracotomy most.\n\nConclusion: \nThe use of tele-mentored surgery to assist non-surgeon clinicians in the performance of damage-control and emergency surgical procedures is feasible. More study is required to validate its effectiveness.","authors":["Philip Dawe","Andrew Kirkpatrick","Max Talbot","Andrew Beckett"],"meta":["February 2018The American Journal of Surgery 215(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.amjsurg.2018.01.016"],"references":["221904967_Analysis_of_Life-Saving_Interventions_Performed_by_Out-of-Hospital_Combat_Medical_Personnel","235681398_Resuscitative_thoracotomy_following_wartime_injury"]}
