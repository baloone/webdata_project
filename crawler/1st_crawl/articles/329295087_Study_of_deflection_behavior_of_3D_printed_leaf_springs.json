{"id":"329295087_Study_of_deflection_behavior_of_3D_printed_leaf_springs","abstract":"The authors developed a research for studying the behaviour of 3D printed machine elements such as: clutches, springs, bellows, screws, nuts, gears, differential and planetary mechanisms. There are different applications where metallic springs cannot be used: corrosive, explosive, magnetic field, electromagnetic radiation, nuclear techniques and other applications or environments that require light spring masses.","authors":["D Besnea","Ciprian Rizescu","Dana Rizescu","Constantin Daniel Comeaga"],"meta":["November 2018IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 444(4):042008","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/444/4/042008","Project: Mechanism for precision mechanics"],"references":["319017190_Research_on_Implementation_Orthopedic_Prostheses_Ankle_by_the_Process_Rapid_Prototyping","263732880_ELEMENTE_SI_MECANISME_DE_MECANICA_FINA_-_Partea_I"]}
