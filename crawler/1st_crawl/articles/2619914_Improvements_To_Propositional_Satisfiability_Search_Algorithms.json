{"id":"2619914_Improvements_To_Propositional_Satisfiability_Search_Algorithms","abstract":"quickly across a wide range of hard SAT problems than any other SAT tester in the literature on comparable platforms. On a Sun SPARCStation 10 running SunOS 4.1.3 U1, POSIT can solve hard random 400-variable 3-SAT problems in about 2 hours on the average. In general, it can solve hard n-variable random 3-SAT problems with search trees of size O(2 n=18:7 ). In addition to justifying these claims, this dissertation describes the most significant achievements of other researchers in this area, and discusses all of the widely known general techniques for speeding up SAT search algorithms. It should be useful to anyone interested in NP-complete problems or combinatorial optimization in general, and it should be iii particularly useful to researchers in either Artificial Intelligence or Operations Research. iv Acknowledgments I would like to thank the members of my committee: Sanguthevar Raja","authors":["Jon William Freeman"],"meta":["April 1996"],"references":["247390996_Representation_et_utilisation_de_la_connaissance_en_calcul_propositionnel","239034971_Optimization_in_constraint_networks","223327412_Refutational_theorem_proving_using_term-rewriting_systems","222437155_Increasing_Tree_Search_Efficiency_for_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220814617_A_comparison_of_ATMS_and_CSP_techniques","220779789_On_the_Satisfiability_and_Maximum_Satisfiability_of_Random_3-CNF_Formulas","341914056_Solving_satisfiability_in_less_than_2n_steps","313123817_Constraint_satisfaction","284528353_A_Machine-Oriented_Logic_based_on_the_Resolution_Principle","247931462_Logic_for_Computer_Science_Foundations_of_Automatic_Theorem_Proving","247442350_Satis_ability_and_Hypergraphs","247251206_Principles_of_Arti_cal_Intelligence","245279170_The_Heuristic_Problem-Solving_Approach","245093487_A_Survey_of_Average_Time_Analyses_of_Satis_ability_Algorithms","244954154_A_Computing_Procedure_for_Quantification_Theory","243771760_The_Minimal_Disagreement_Parity_Problem_as_a_Hard_SatisfiabilityProblem","243677534_Critical_behavior_in_the_satis_ability_of_random_Boolean_expressions","242563585_On_the_Complexity_of_Derivation_in_Propositional_Calculus","240041980_Improvement_to_Propositional_Satis_ability_Search_Algorithms","239061028_E_ciency_and_stability_of_hypergraph_SAT_algorithms","237128982_A_fast_parallel_SAT-solver_with_Efficient_Work-load_Balancing","235093167_Performance_Measurement_and_Analysis_of_Certain_Search_Algorithms","234778112_Writing_Efficient_Programs","234234853_Forward_Reasoning_and_Dependency-Directed_Backtracking_in_a_System_for_Computer-Aided_Circuit_Analysis","230641688_Tabu_Search_and_Quadratic_Relaxation_for_the_Satisability_Problem","228057890_On_the_Approximation_of_Maximum_Satisfiability","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","226950839_Power_indices_and_easier_hard_problems","226541206_A_linear_expected-time_algorithm_for_deriving_all_logical_conclusions_implied_by_a_set_of_boolean_inequalities","226497207_Branch-and-cut_solution_of_inference_problems_in_propositional_logic","226198800_Running_time_experiments_on_some_algorithms_for_solving_propositional_satisfiability_problems","224103817_Efficient_search_techniques-An_empirical_study_of_the_N-Queens_Problem","223175582_Some_results_and_experiments_in_programming_techniques_for_propositional_logic","223117454_Heuristics_and_their_design_a_survey","222961722_Complete_problems_for_deterministic_polynomial_time","222805511_The_intractability_of_Resolution","222804605_A_note_on_Dowling_and_Gallier's_top-down_algorithm_for_propositional_Horn_satisfiability","222595577_A_hierarchy_of_tractable_satisfiability_problems","222485242_On_the_greedy_algorithm_for_satisfiability","222464406_Enhancement_schemes_for_constraint_processing_Backjumping_learning_and_cutset_decomposition","222444557_Consistency_in_Networks_of_Relations","222443833_The_Class_of_Problems_That_are_Linearly_Equivalent_to_Satisfiability_or_a_Uniform_Method_for_Proving_NP-Completeness","222437492_Tree_clustering_for_constraint_networks","221606531_Solving_Large-Scale_Constraint-Satisfaction_and_Scheduling_Problems_Using_a_Heuristic_Repair_Method","221591773_878-approximation_algorithms_for_MAX_CUT_and_MAX_2SAT","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","221033559_How_to_Use_Symmetries_in_Boolean_Constraint_Solving","220898229_On_Enumeration_Procedures_for_Theorem_Proving_and_for_Integer_Programming","220805884_A_Satisfiability_Tester_for_Non-Clausal_Propositional_Calculus","220805876_ONTIC_A_Knowledge_Representation_System_for_Mathematics","220616976_On_the_Complexity_of_Timetable_and_Multicommodity_Flow_Problems","220669326_A_Computational_Study_of_Satisfiability_Algorithms_for_Propositional_Logic","220618236_Planar_Formulae_and_Their_Uses","220617467_CNF-Satisfiability_Test_by_Counting_and_Polynomial_Average_Time","220616536_On_Resolution_with_Clauses_of_Bounded_Size"]}
