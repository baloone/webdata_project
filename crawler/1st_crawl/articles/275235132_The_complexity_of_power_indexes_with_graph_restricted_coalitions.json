{"id":"275235132_The_complexity_of_power_indexes_with_graph_restricted_coalitions","abstract":"Coalitions of weighted voting games can be restricted to be connected components of a graph. As a consequence, coalition formation, and therefore a playerâ€™s power, depends on the topology of the graph. We analyze the problems of computing the Banzhaf and the Shapley-Shubik power indexes for this class of voting games and prove that calculating them is #P-complete in the strong sense for general graphs. For trees, we provide pseudo-polynomial time algorithms and prove #P-completeness in the weak sense for both indices.","authors":["Stefano Benati","Romeo Rizzi","Craig A.
