{"id":"344090539_Authente-Kente_enabling_authentication_for_artisanal_economies_with_deep_learning","abstract":"The economy for artisanal products, such as Navajo rugs or Pashmina shawls are often threatened by mass-produced fakes. We propose the use of AI-based authentication as one part of a larger system that would replace extractive economies with generative circulation. In this case study we examine initial experiments towards the development of a cell phone-based authentication app for kente cloth in West Africa. We describe the context of weavers and cloth sales; an initial test of a machine learning algorithm for distinguishing between real and fake kente, and an outline of the next stages of development.","authors":["Kwame Porter Robinson","Ron Eglash","Audrey Bennett","Sansitha Nandakumar"],"meta":["March 2021AI & SOCIETY 36(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00146-020-01055-2","Project: Human Interaction with Artificial Intelligence (HIAI)"],"references":["338001332_Deep_convolutional_neural_network_based_medical_image_classification_for_disease_diagnosis","336227027_Automation_for_the_artisanal_economy_enhancing_the_economic_and_environmental_sustainability_of_crafting_professions_with_human-machine_collaboration","335906285_Automation_for_the_Artisanal_Economy_Enhancing_the_Economic_and_Environmental_Sustainability_of_Crafting_Professions_with_Human-Machine_Collaboration","334279066_A_survey_on_Image_Data_Augmentation_for_Deep_Learning","332859288_Causes_and_Effects_of_the_Dwindled_State_of_the_Ghana_Textile_Industry","328838624_No_More_FOMO_Limiting_Social_Media_Decreases_Loneliness_and_Depression","327148996_Classification_Assessment_Methods_a_detailed_tutorial","340515032_A_Survey_of_Outlier_Detection_Methodologies","335778882_Energy_and_Policy_Considerations_for_Deep_Learning_in_NLP","316705561_Global_Negative_Effects_of_the_Technological_Change_on_Human_Health_The_High_Incidence_of_Cancers_in_the_Anthropocene"]}
