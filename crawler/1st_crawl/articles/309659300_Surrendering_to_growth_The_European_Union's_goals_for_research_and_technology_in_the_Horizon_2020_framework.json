{"id":"309659300_Surrendering_to_growth_The_European_Union's_goals_for_research_and_technology_in_the_Horizon_2020_framework","abstract":"The European Union is one of the major global players in environmental protection policy and has furthermore turned focus towards human wellbeing, global justice and development. Especially, the political agenda on beyond the Gross Domestic Product might change the way Europe measures progress, economic development and the relevance of environmental protection and address debates around the concept of degrowth. This article aims at tracing degrowth elements in European Union's Horizon 2020 program, the research and innovation agenda and funding scheme of the Union, which constitutes one of the Union's major instruments steering economic development. Employing a frame analysis this research detects some traces of a “beyond-GDP” agenda in the Horizon 2020 framework, but economic growth remains the central focus of the policy, also “green growth” measures being subordinated to the overall growth agenda. We show that this pattern is even more evident in technology policy and schemes related to ICT in particular. The article reflects on reasons for seeing only minor traces of a degrowth agenda, pointing to a neo-liberal meta-frame and effects of path dependency of European internal market integration framing of technology as a driver of prosperity. Finally, the paper identifies comparative policy analysis as a promising area for deeper integration of degrowth theory into political science research.","authors":["Jan Pollex","Andrea Lenschow"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Cleaner Production 197(2):1863-1871","DOI:10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.195"],"references":["315498093_The_Politics_of_Environmental_DiscourseEcological_Modernization_and_the_Policy_Process","282925350_Shifting_Policy_Narratives_in_Horizon_2020","271673542_Why_are_neoliberal_ideas_so_resilient_in_Europe's_political_economy","260161434_What_is_Degrowth_From_an_Activist_Slogan_to_a_Social_Movement","237556202_A_Decade_of_Discourse_Analysis_of_Environmental_Politics_Achievements_Challenges_Perspectives","235291340_Escaping_from_the_economy_the_politics_of_degrowth","233490560_Green_Economy_-_the_Next_Oxymoron_No_Lessons_Learned_from_Failures_of_Implementing_Sustainable_Development","229054085_The_Politics_of_Governance_Architectures_Creation_Change_and_Effects_of_the_EU_Lisbon_Strategy","227650713_Deliberate_futures_Precaution_and_progress_in_social_choice_of_sustainable_technology","24112872_Innovation_policy_in_the_European_Union_instruments_and_objectives","309663060_Zysman_J_1989","309661258_Setting_the_agenda_for_a_new_Europe_The_ERT_and_EC_1992","299632024_Narrative_Policy_Analysis","299435302_The_EU's_current_crisis_and_its_policy_effects_research_design_and_comparative_findings","290003370_Interpretation_and_Intention_in_Policy_Analysis","285594470_Policy_Framing_in_the_European_Union","272821728_Horizon_2020_-_The_Framework_Programme_for_Research_and_Innovation_-_Communication_from_the_Commission","260161433_The_Social_Dynamics_of_Degrowth","249668769_Harnessing_the_Information_Society_European_Union_Policy_and_Information_and_Communication_Technologies","244950767_1992_Recasting_the_European_Bargain","239768359_Sustainable_Degrowth","231781674_The_Governance_of_the_European_Union_A_New_Institutionalist_Approach","228224580_New_Regulatory_Approaches_in_'Greening'_EU_Policies","227414533_In_Defence_of_Degrowth","223828396_Economic_De-growth_vs_Steady-state_Economy","222707924_Sustainable_De-Growth_Mapping_the_Context_Criticisms_and_Future_Prospects_of_an_Emergent_Paradigm","222209490_Economic_Growth_in_the_New_Economy_Evidence_from_Advanced_Economies","220260277_Information_Systems_Innovation_for_Environmental_Sustainability","40937185_The_Politics_of_Environmental_Discourse_Ecological_Modernization_and_the_Policy_Process","40496142_Introduction_Institutional_Change_in_Advanced_Political_Economies","31694506_Technology_policy_in_the_European_Union_J_Peterson_M_Sharp","23992059_i-Development_Not_e-Development_Special_Issue_on_ICTs_and_Development","23522769_Setting_the_agenda_for_a_new_Europe_the_ERT_and_EC_1992"]}
