{"id":"220139097_The_Sum_of_D_Small-Bias_Generators_Fools_Polynomials_of_Degree_D","abstract":"We prove that the sum of d small-bias generators \\(L : {\\mathbb{F}}^{s} \\rightarrow {\\mathbb{F}}^{n}\\) fools degree-d polynomials in n variables over a field \\({\\mathbb{F}}\\), for any fixed degree d and field \\({\\mathbb{F}}\\), including \\({\\mathbb{F}} = {\\mathbb{F}}_{2} = \\{0, 1\\}\\). Our result builds on, simplifies, and improves on both the work by Bogdanov and Viola (FOCS ’07) and the follow-up by Lovett (STOC ’08). The first relies on a conjecture that turned out to be true only for some degrees and fields, while the latter considers the sum of 2d\nsmall-bias generators (as opposed to d in our result).","authors":["Emanuele Viola"],"meta":["January 2007computational complexity 14(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-009-0273-5","SourceDBLP"],"references":["1899973_Inverse_Conjecture_for_the_Gowers_norm_is_false","221591876_Pseudorandom_generators_for_low_degree_polynomials","221499202_Simple_Constructions_of_Almost_k-Wise_Independent_Random_Variables","4294386_Pseudorandom_Bits_for_Polynomials","3516091_Deterministic_approximate_counting_of_depth-2_circuits","2329655_Small-Bias_Probability_Spaces_Efficient_Constructions_and_Applications","2127335_Low-degree_tests_at_large_distances","2118144_An_inverse_theorem_for_the_Gowers_U3_norm","1763318_The_distribution_of_polynomials_over_finite_fields_with_applications_to_the_Gowers_norms"]}
