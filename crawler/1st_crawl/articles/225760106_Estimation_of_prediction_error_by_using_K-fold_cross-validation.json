{"id":"225760106_Estimation_of_prediction_error_by_using_K-fold_cross-validation","abstract":"Estimation of prediction accuracy is important when our aim is prediction. The training error is an easy estimate of prediction\nerror, but it has a downward bias. On the other hand, K-fold cross-validation has an upward bias. The upward bias may be negligible in leave-one-out cross-validation, but it sometimes\ncannot be neglected in 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation, which are favored from a computational standpoint. Since the training\nerror has a downward bias and K-fold cross-validation has an upward bias, there will be an appropriate estimate in a family that connects the two estimates.\nIn this paper, we investigate two families that connect the training error and K-fold cross-validation.\n\nKeywordsBias correction–\nK-fold cross-validation–Large dataset–Prediction error","authors":["Tadayoshi Fushiki"],"meta":["April 2011Statistics and Computing 21(2):137-146","DOI:10.1007/s11222-009-9153-8","SourceDBLP"],"references":["243769929_A_Comparative_Study_of_Ordinary_Cross-Validation_v-Fold_Cross-Validation_and_the_Repeated_Learning-Testing_Methods","37434447_Bootstrap_Methods_and_Their_Application","1915938_Consistency_of_cross_validation_for_comparing_regression_procedures","285443873_An_Asymptotic_Equivalence_of_Choice_of_Model_by_Cross-Validation_and_Akaike's_Criterion","257925521_An_asymptotic_equivalence_of_choice_of_model_by_cross-validation_and_Akaike's_Criterion","246377299_Bootstrap_Methods_and_Their_Application_Vol_10","243708220_Cross-Validatory_Choice_and_Assessment_of_Statistical_Predictions_With_Discussion","242358078_The_Elements_Of_Statistical_Learning","239063723_Linear_Model_Selection_by_Cross-Validation","234810287_Information_Criteria_and_Statistical_Modeling","224817353_Asymptotic_Statistics","222431137_Bias_correction_of_cross-validation_criterion_based_on_Kullback-Leibler_information_under_a_general_condition","221995968_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Springer-Verlag_New_York","38360202_Asymptotic_Optimality_for_C_p_C_L_Cross-Validation_and_Generalized_Cross-Validation_Discrete_Index_Set","4746941_The_Estimation_of_Prediction_Error_Covariance_Penalties_and_Cross-Validation"]}
