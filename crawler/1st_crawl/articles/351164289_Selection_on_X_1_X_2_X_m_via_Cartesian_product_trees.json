{"id":"351164289_Selection_on_X_1_X_2_X_m_via_Cartesian_product_trees","abstract":"Selection on the Cartesian product is a classic problem in computer science. Recently, an optimal algorithm for selection on A + B, based on soft heaps, was introduced. By combining this approach with layer-ordered heaps (LOHs), an algorithm using a balanced binary tree of A + B selections was proposed to perform selection on X1 + X2 + ⋯ + X\nm\nin o(n⋅m + k⋅m), where X\ni\nhave length n. Here, that o(n⋅m + k⋅m) algorithm is combined with a novel, optimal LOH-based algorithm for selection on A + B (without a soft heap). Performance of algorithms for selection on X1 + X2 + ⋯ + X\nm\nare compared empirically, demonstrating the benefit of the algorithm proposed here.","authors":["Patrick Kreitzberg","Kyle Lucke","Jake Pennington","Oliver Serang"],"meta":["April 2021PeerJ Computer Science 7(3):e483","DOI:10.7717/peerj-cs.483"],"references":["233937333_Necklaces_Convolutions_and_XY","342941449_Fast_Exact_Computation_of_the_k_Most_Abundant_Isotope_Peaks_with_Layer-Ordered_Heaps","323302779_Selection_from_heaps_row-sorted_matrices_and_XY_using_soft_heaps","306172958_A_Bounded_p-norm_Approximation_of_Max-Convolution_for_Sub-Quadratic_Bayesian_Inference_on_Additive_Factors","270824650_A_Fast_Numerical_Method_for_Max-Convolution_and_the_Application_to_Efficient_Max-Product_Inference_in_Bayesian_Networks","223810359_The_complexity_of_selection_and_ranking_in_X_Y_and_matrices_with_sorted_columns","222641595_How_good_is_the_information_theory_bound_in_sorting","222470079_Fast_algorithms_for_the_maximum_convolution_problem","220616998_Selecting_the_Kth_element_in_X_Y_and_X_1_X_2_X_m","220432308_The_soft_heap_An_approximate_priority_queue_with_optimal_error_rate"]}
