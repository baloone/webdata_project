{"id":"346227441_On_BV-Algebras","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the notion of a BV-algebra, and we show that a BV-algebra is logically equivalent to several algebras, i.e., BM-algebras, BT-algebras, BO-algebras and 0-commutative B-algebras. Moreover, we show that a BV-algebra with (F) is logically equivalent to several algebras, and we show some relationships between a BV-algebra with (F) and several related algebras.","authors":["In Ho Hwang","Liu Yong Lin","Hee Sik Kim"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.3390/math8101779"],"references":["268071837_A_new_characterization_of_ideals_in_BCC-algebras","257909197_On_BO-algebras","257909165_On_BF-algebras","226748376_Pre-coxeter_algebras_and_related_topics","266423775_On_B-algebras_and_quasigroups","265369885_On_BCH-algebras","265354706_An_introduction_to_theory_of_BCK-algebras","264153208_On_BN-algebras"]}
