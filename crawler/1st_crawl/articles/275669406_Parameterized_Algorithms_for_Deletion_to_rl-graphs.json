{"id":"275669406_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Deletion_to_rl-graphs","abstract":"For fixed integers $r,\\ell \\geq 0$, a graph $G$ is called an {\\em\n$(r,\\ell)$-graph} if the vertex set $V(G)$ can be partitioned into $r$\nindependent sets and $\\ell$ cliques. This brings us to the following natural\nparameterized questions: {\\sc Vertex $(r,\\ell)$-Partization} and {\\sc Edge\n$(r,\\ell)$-Partization}. An input to these problems consist of a graph $G$ and\na positive integer $k$ and the objective is to decide whether there exists a\nset $S\\subseteq V(G)$ ($S\\subseteq E(G)$) such that the deletion of $S$ from\n$G$ results in an $(r,\\ell)$-graph. These problems generalize well studied\nproblems such as {\\sc Odd Cycle Transversal}, {\\sc Edge Odd Cycle Transversal},\n{\\sc Split Vertex Deletion} and {\\sc Split Edge Deletion}. We do not hope to\nget parameterized algorithms for either {\\sc Vertex $(r,\\ell)$-Partization} or\n{\\sc Edge $(r,\\ell)$-Partization} when either of $r$ or $\\ell$ is at least $3$\nas the recognition problem itself is NP-complete. This leaves the case of\n$r,\\ell \\in \\{1,2\\}$. We almost complete the parameterized complexity dichotomy\nfor these problems. Only the parameterized complexity of {\\sc Edge\n$(2,2)$-Partization} remains open. We also give an approximation algorithm and\na Turing kernelization for {\\sc Vertex $(r,\\ell)$-Partization}. We use an\ninteresting finite forbidden induced graph characterization, for a class of\ngraphs known as $(r,\\ell)$-split graphs, properly containing the class of\n$(r,\\ell)$-graphs. This approach to obtain approximation algorithms could be of\nan independent interest.","authors":["Sudeshna Kolay","Fahad Panolan"],"meta":["April 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262326838_Faster_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Deletion_to_Split_Graphs","236455802_Linear_Time_Parameterized_Algorithms_via_Skew-Symmetric_Multicuts","228741795_Simplicity_is_beauty_Improved_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","226724746_Algorithm_Engineering_for_Optimal_Graph_Bipartization","221668653_Faster_Parameterized_Algorithms_Using_Linear_Programming","220639686_Algorithm_Engineering_for_Optimal_Graph_Bipartization","220266532_Simpler_Parameterized_Algorithm_for_OCT","51946971_Finding_Small_Separators_in_Linear_Time_via_Treewidth_Reduction","45926295_Listing_All_Maximal_Cliques_in_Sparse_Graphs_in_Near-Optimal_Time","273798010_Graph_Theory","265824090_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_rl-Partization","257642052_Partitioning_Chordal_Graphs","256720832_Split_Vertex_Deletion_meets_Vertex_Cover_New_fixed-parameter_and_exact_exponential-time_algorithms","251331137_On_the_Complexity_of_Some_Problems_Related_to_Graph_Extensions","249995367_Linear-Time_FPT_Algorithms_via_Network_Flow","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","223295622_Finding_odd_cycle_transversals","222447584_The_monadic_second-order_logic_of_graphs_I_Recognizable_sets_of_finite_graphs","221591431_Olog_n_approximation_algorithms_for_Min_UnCut_Min_2CNF_Deletion_and_Directed_Cut_problems","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220573691_Compression-based_fixed-parameter_algorithms_for_feedback_vertex_set_and_edge_bipartization","220076656_Generalized_Split_Graphs_and_Ramsey_Numbers","51952991_Representative_Sets_and_Irrelevant_Vertices_New_Tools_for_Kernelization","51941548_Compression_via_Matroids_A_Randomized_Polynomial_Kernel_for_Odd_CycleTransversal"]}
