{"id":"256666227_A_New_Framework_and_Software_to_Estimate_Time-Varying_Reproduction_Numbers_During_Epidemics","abstract":"The quantification of transmissibility during epidemics is essential to designing and adjusting public health responses. Transmissibility\ncan be measured by the reproduction number R, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in\nstatistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond,\nWashington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary\ncase and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates\nof R are consistent with those presented in the literature. This tool should help epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in\nthe transmission intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.","authors":["Anne Cori","Neil Ferguson","Christophe Fraser","Simon Cauchemez"],"meta":["September 2013American Journal of Epidemiology 178(9)","DOI:10.1093/aje/kwt133","SourcePubMed"],"references":["291546924_Epidemiological_determinants_of_spread_of_causal_agent_of_severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_in_Hong_Kong","313761792_Influenza_in_Maryland_Preliminary_statistics_of_certain_localities","292340332_A_Major_Outbreak_of_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_in_Hong_Kong","292278145_Transmissibility_of_pandemic_influenza_AH1N1v_during_the_2009_influenza_season_in_New_Zealand_Determining_the_effective_reproduction_number_and_the_influence_of_age_ethnicity_and_importations","278232338_Epidemiological_determinants_of_spread_of_causal_agent_of_severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_in_Hong_Kong","264694155_Incubation_and_HIV_Survival_Including_the_CASCADE_EU_Concerted_Action_Time_from_HIV-1_seroconversion_to_AIDS_and_death_before_widespread_use_of_highly-active_antiretroviral_therapy","244900609_On_a_new_anesthetic_agent_more_efficient_than_sulphuric_ether","227686336_Bayesian_Inference_for_Contact_Networks_Given_Epidemic_Data","221860757_A_Network-based_Analysis_of_the_1861_Hagelloch_Measles_Data","216636041_Transmission_Dynamics_of_the_Etiological_Agent_of_SARS_in_Hong_Kong_Impact_of_Public_Health"]}
