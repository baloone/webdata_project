{"id":"225367682_Constrained_Inverse_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problems_under_the_Bottleneck-Type_Hamming_Distance","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the inverse minimum spanning tree problem under the bottleneck-type Hamming distance, where the\nweights of edges can be modified only within given intervals. We further consider the constrained case in which the total\nmodification cost cannot exceed a given upper bound. It is shown that these inverse problems can be transformed into a minimum\nnode cover problem on a bipartite graph, and we give a strongly polynomial time algorithm to solve this type of node cover\nproblems.","authors":["Zhang Binwu","Jian zhong Zhang","Yong He"],"meta":["March 2006Journal of Global Optimization 34(3):467-474","DOI:10.1007/s10898-005-6470-0"],"references":["220089378_Weighted_Inverse_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problems_Under_Hamming_Distance","220089254_Inverse_Combinatorial_Optimization_A_Survey_on_Problems_Methods_and_Results","2364870_Inverse_Optimization_A_Survey_on_Problems_Methods_and_Results"]}
