{"id":"317396600_Does_like_seek_like_The_formation_of_working_groups_in_a_programming_project","abstract":"In a course of the degree of computer science, the programming project has changed from individual to teamed work, tentatively in couples (pair programming). Students have full freedom to team up with minimum intervention from teachers. The analysis of the couples made indicates that students do not tend to associate with students with a similar academic performance, maybe because general cognitive parameters do not govern the choice of academic partners. Pair programming seems to give great results, so the efforts of future research in this field should focus precisely on how these pairs are formed, underpinning the mechanisms of human social interactions.","authors":["Eduard Sanou Gozalo","Antoni Hernández-Fernández","Marta Arias","Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Technology and Science Education 7(2):231","DOI:10.3926/jotse.255","Project: BCN-SEER: Research in Education"],"references":["265258093_Defining_the_Boundaries_for_Neuroeducation_as_a_Field_of_Study","242350622_Turning_student_groups_into_effective_teams","311898370_What_do_you_mean_by_collaborative_learning","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","263927756_Tuning_Educational_Structures_in_Europe","249797612_Homogeneous_and_Heterogeneous_Ability_Grouping_Principal_Findings_and_Implications_for_Evaluating_and_Designing_More_Effective_Educational_Environments","242698206_Forming_Homogeneous_Heterogeneous_and_Mixed_Groups_of_Learners","240313193_The_group_mind_Generative_and_regressive_groups","228905992_Genetic_similarity_human_altruism_and_group_selection_Behavioral_and_Brain_Sciences_12_503-559","228328575_Pair_Programming_Illuminated"]}
