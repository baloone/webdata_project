{"id":"332994467_A_new_quantum_approach_to_binary_classification","abstract":"This paper proposes a new quantum-like method for the binary classification applied to classical datasets. Inspired by the quantum Helstrom measurement, this innovative approach has enabled us to define a new classifier, called Helstrom Quantum Centroid (HQC). This binary classifier (inspired by the concept of distinguishability between quantum states) acts on density matrices—called density patterns—that are the quantum encoding of classical patterns of a dataset. In this paper we compare the performance of HQC with respect to twelve standard (linear and non-linear) classifiers over fourteen different datasets. The experimental results show that HQC outperforms the other classifiers when compared to the Balanced Accuracy and other statistical measures. Finally, we show that the performance of our classifier is positively correlated to the increase in the number of “quantum copies” of a pattern and the resulting tensor product thereof.","authors":["Giuseppe Sergioli","Roberto Giuntini","Hector Freytes"],"meta":["May 2019PLoS ONE 14(5):e0216224","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0216224"],"references":["323627475_Quantum-inspired_Minimum_Distance_Classification_in_Biomedical_Context","321454607_Quantum_Minimum_Distance_Classifier","315985865_A_Quantum-inspired_Version_of_the_Classification_Problem","314182084_PMLB_A_Large_Benchmark_Suite_for_Machine_Learning_Evaluation_and_Comparison","312416966_A_quantum-inspired_version_of_the_nearest_mean_classifier","265554646_An_introduction_to_quantum_machine_learning","319207907_Pattern_Classification","307065704_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition_Second_Edition","277240206_Quantum_learning_optimal_classification_of_qubit_states","265564295_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information_10th_Anniversary_Edition"]}
