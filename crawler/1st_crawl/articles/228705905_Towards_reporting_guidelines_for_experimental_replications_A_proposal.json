{"id":"228705905_Towards_reporting_guidelines_for_experimental_replications_A_proposal","abstract":"The value of experimental replications has been well established. In order for the replicating researcher and the community to receive the greatest benefit from a replication, the right information about it must be published. This paper proposes publishing guidelines to increase the value of experimental replications. First, a review of some published replications highlights the variation in current publishing practice. Then, a set of guidelines are proposed. The goal of this paper is to provide a starting point for a discussion that will formalize and publish a set of guidelines.","authors":["Jeff Carver"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["226750589_Reporting_Experiments_in_Software_Engineering","225216446_A_Controlled_Experiment_Comparing_the_Maintainability_of_Programs_Designed_with_and_without_Design_Patterns-A_Replication_in_a_Real_Programming_Environment","221494760_On_the_effectiveness_of_dynamic_modeling_in_UML_Results_from_an_external_replication","220277872_Perspective-Based_Reading_A_Replicated_Experiment_Focused_on_Individual_Reviewer_Effectiveness","220277805_An_Externally_Replicated_Experiment_for_Evaluating_the_Learning_Effectiveness_of_Using_Simulations_in_Software_Project_Management_Education","225259651_A_Replicated_Empirical_Study_of_the_Impact_of_the_Methods_in_the_PSP_on_Individual_Engineers","225205573_Further_Experiences_with_Scenarios_and_Checklists","221494869_Evaluation_of_model-based_testing_techniques_selection_approaches_An_external_replication","220277891_An_Extended_Replication_of_an_Experiment_for_Assessing_Methods_for_Software_Requirements_Inspections","220277812_The_role_of_replications_in_Empirical_Software_Engineering"]}
