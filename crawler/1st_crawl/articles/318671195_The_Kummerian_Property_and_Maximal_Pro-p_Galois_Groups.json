{"id":"318671195_The_Kummerian_Property_and_Maximal_Pro-p_Galois_Groups","abstract":"For a prime number $p$, we give a new restriction on pro-$p$ groups $G$ which are realizable as the maximal pro-$p$ Galois group $G_F(p)$ for a field $F$ containing a root of unity of order $p$. This restriction arises from Kummer Theory and the structure of the maximal $p$-radical extension of $F$. We study it in the abstract context of pro-$p$ groups $G$ with a continuous homomorphism $\\theta\\colon G\\to1+p\\mathbb{Z}_p$, and characterize it cohomologically, and in terms of 1-cocycles on $G$. This is used to produce new examples of pro-$p$ groups which do not occur as maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups of fields as above.","authors":["Ido Efrat","Claudio Quadrelli"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Algebra","DOI:10.1016/j.jalgebra.2019.01.015","Project: Galois cohomology and profinite groups"],"references":["292373910_Profinite_groups_with_a_cyclotomic_p-orientation","269997990_Triple_Massey_products_and_absolute_Galois_groups","269997749_Triple_Massey_products_vanish_over_all_fields","268451793_Triple_Massey_products_in_Galois_cohomology","313175752_Galois_groups_of_maximal_p-extensions","307716462_The_group_of_the_maximal_-extension_of_a_local_field","289080291_Structure_de_certains_pro-p-groupes_d'apres_Demuskin","285908961_n-Nilpotent_obstructions_to_p1-sections_of_P1set_minus0_1_and_Massey_products_In_Conference_on_Galois-Teichmuller_Theory_and_Arithmetic_Geometry","284143045_On_the_maximal_p-extension_of_a_local_field","280911963_Combinatorial_Techniques_in_the_Galois_Theory_of_p-Extensions"]}
