{"id":"333572205_How_Society_Can_Maintain_Human-Centric_Artificial_Intelligence","abstract":"Although not a goal universally held, maintaining human-centric artificial intelligence is necessary for societyâ€™s long-term stability. Fortunately, the legal and technological problems of maintaining control are actually fairly well understood and amenable to engineering. The real problem is establishing the social and political will for assigning and maintaining accountability for artifacts when these artifacts are generated or used. In this chapter we review the necessity and tractability of maintaining human control and the mechanisms by which such control can be achieved. What makes the problem both most interesting and most threatening is that achieving consensus around any human-centered approach requires at least some measure of agreement on broad existential concerns.","authors":["Joanna J Bryson","Andreas Theodorou"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-981-13-7725-9_16","In book: Human-Centered Digitalization and Services (pp.305-323)"],"references":["336088589_The_Sustainability_Game_AI_Technology_as_an_Intervention_for_Public_Understanding_of_Cooperative_Investment","328709417_Instinct_A_Biologically_Inspired_Reactive_Planner_for_Intelligent_Embedded_Systems","323227141_Patiency_is_not_a_virtue_the_design_of_intelligent_systems_and_systems_of_ethics","322223875_ABOD3_A_Graphical_Visualization_and_Real-Time_Debugging_Tool_for_BOD_Agents","321814030_Improving_robot_transparency_Real-time_visualisation_of_robot_AI_substantially_improves_understanding_in_naive_observers","320046311_Of_for_and_by_the_people_the_legal_lacuna_of_synthetic_persons","318538795_Robot_Transparency_Improving_Understanding_of_Intelligent_Behaviour_for_Designers_and_Users","316973825_Semantics_derived_automatically_from_language_corpora_contain_human-like_biases","316898639_Standardizing_Ethical_Design_for_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Autonomous_Systems","315658333_Privacy_After_the_Agile_Turn","306885285_Semantics_derived_automatically_from_language_corpora_necessarily_contain_human_biases","265754004_Agile_Software_Development_The_Cooperative_Game_An_Overview","262377672_Behaviour_Oriented_Design_for_Real-Time-Strategy_Games_An_Approach_on_Iterative_Development_for_sc_StarCraft_AI","247210341_POSH_Tools_for_Game_Agent_Development_by_Students_and_Non-Programmers","246449429_Integrating_Life-Like_Action_Selection_into_Cycle-Based_Agent_Simulation_Environments","244434131_Lessons_from_animal_learning_for_the_study_of_cognitive_development","239720974_Action_Selection_and_Individuation_in_Agent_Based_Modelling","232616388_MyNet_A_Platform_for_Secure_P2P_Personal_and_Social_Networking_Services","220814506_Just_an_Artifact_Why_Machines_Are_Perceived_as_Moral_Agents","220535464_Simplifying_the_Design_of_Human-Like_Behaviour_Emotions_as_Durative_Dynamic_State_for_Action_Selection","35248410_Intelligence_by_design_principles_of_modularity_and_coordination_for_engineering_complex_adaptive_agents","6010079_New_Approaches_to_Robotics","2461262_Cross-Paradigm_Analysis_of_Autonomous_Agent_Architecture","346624964_The_Black_Box_Society_The_Secret_Algorithms_That_Control_Money_and_Information","323841797_The_Extended_Ramp_Model_A_Biomimetic_Model_of_Behaviour_Arbitration_for_Lightweight_Cognitive_Architectures","317248060_Designing_and_implementing_transparency_for_real_time_inspection_of_autonomous_robots","314892286_Moral_Crumple_Zones_Cautionary_Tales_in_Human-Robot_Interaction_WeRobot_2016","291601850_Group_Agency_The_Possibility_Design_and_Status_of_Corporate_Agents","287254569_Group_Agency_The_Possibility_Des_and_Status_of_Corp_Agents","264635980_Replicators_lineages_and_interactors","257623129_The_Superintelligent_Will_Motivation_and_Instrumental_Rationality_in_Advanced_Artificial_Agents","246356425_Handling_Complexity_in_the_Halo_2_AI","233823192_Insect_learning_ecological_and_evolutionary_perspectives","233074812_The_Generic_Nature_of_the_Concepts_of_Stimulus_and_Response","223067975_The_role_of_trust_in_automation_reliance","222467844_Planning_for_Conjunctive_Goals","37991361_Old_tricks_new_dogs_ethology_and_interactive_creatures"]}
