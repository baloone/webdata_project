The schemes are based on highly accurate and robust numerical differentiation approaches which use non-real numbers, i.e., complex variables and hyper-dual numbers. The main advantage of these approaches are that, contrary to the classical finite difference scheme, no round-off errors in the perturbations due to floating-point arithmetics exist within the calculation of the tangent matrices. This results in a method which is independent of perturbation values (in case of complex step derivative approximations if sufficiently small perturbations are chosen). An efficient algorithmic treatment is presented which enables a straightforward implementation of the method in any standard finite-element program. By means of hyperelastic, finite strain elastoplastic, and thermo-elastoplastic boundary value problems, the performance of the proposed approaches is analyzed.","authors":["Masato Tanaka","Daniel Balzani","Jörg Schröder"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-39022-2_1","In book: Innovative Numerical Approaches for Multi-Field and Multi-Scale Problems (pp.1-23)"],"references":["269290406_Automatic_implementation_of_finite_strain_anisotropic_hyperelastic_models_using_hyper-dual_numbers","268185174_The_Development_of_Hyper-Dual_Numbers_for_Exact_Second-Derivative_Calculations","262267417_Complex_step_derivative_approximation_for_numerical_evaluation_of_tangent_moduli","259195539_Review_and_Unification_of_Methods_for_Computing_Derivatives_of_Multidisciplinary_Computational_Models","252495558_Extensions_of_the_first_and_second_complex-step_derivative_approximations","238072461_A_polyconvex_framework_for_soft_biological_tissues_Adjustment_to_experimental_data","222734437_A_variational_approach_for_materially_stable_anisotropic_hyperelasticity","222112601_The_Complex-Step_Derivative_Approximation","30843065_Macro_and_micro_scale_modeling_of_thermal_residual_stresses_in_metal_matrix_composite_surface_layers_by_the_homogenization_method","313071493_Preliminary_sketch_of_biquaternions","308198900_The_Finite_Element_Method_for_Solid_and_Structural_Mechanics","276095278_Numerical_calculation_of_thermo-mechanical_problems_at_large_strains_based_on_complex_step_derivative_approximation_of_tangent_stiffness_matrices","272590810_Construction_of_two-_and_three-dimensional_statistically_similar_RVEs_for_coupled_micro-macro_simulations","266966888_A_numerical_two-scale_homogenization_scheme_The_FE2-method","266562174_A_highly_accurate_1st-_and_2nd-order_differentiation_scheme_for_hyperelastic_material_models_based_on_hyper-dual_numbers","259508289_Robust_numerical_calculation_of_tangent_moduli_at_finite_strains_based_on_complex-step_derivative_approximation_and_its_application_to_localization_analysis","258654047_Efficient_variational_constitutive_updates_by_means_of_a_novel_parameterization_of_the_flow_rule","252287938_Towards_variational_constitutive_updates_for_non-associative_plasticity_models_at_finite_strain_Models_based_on_a_volumetric-deviatoric_split","251502859_Numerically_generated_tangent_stiffness_matrices_using_the_complex_variable_derivative_method_for_nonlinear_structural_analysis","238884089_Differentiation_Formulas_for_Analytic_Functions","227838821_Analysis_of_microstructure_development_in_shearbands_by_energy_relaxation_of_incremental_stress_potentials_Large-strain_theory_for_standard_dissipative_solids","223484936_Associated_coupled_thermoplasticity_at_finite_strains_Formulation_numerical_analysis_and_implementation","223199113_Computational_Micro-Macro_Transitions_and_Overall_Moduli_in_the_Analysis_of_Polycrystals_at_Large_Strains","222775194_Numerical_computation_of_algorithmic_consistent_tangent_moduli_in_large-strain_computational_inelasticity","222707177_On_the_implementation_of_rate-independent_standard_dissipative_solids_at_finite_strain_-_Variational_constitutive_updates","222664703_Numerical_differentiation_for_local_and_global_tangent_operators_in_computational_plasticity","222499825_Prediction_of_the_mechanical_behavior_of_nonlinear_heterogeneous_systems_by_multi-level_finite_element_modeling","222441436_The_variational_formulation_of_viscoplastic_constitutive_updates","222032730_A_Framework_for_Finite_Strain_Elastoplasticity_Based_on_Maximum_Plastic_Dissipation_and_the_Multiplicative_Decomposition_Part_II_Computational_Aspects","200093217_Computational_Inelasticity","45251400_Numerical_differentiation_for_non-trivial_consistent_tangent_matrices_An_application_to_the_MRS-Lade_model","36148333_Theorie_und_Numerik_eines_Volumen-Schalen-Elementes_bei_finiten_elastischen_und_plastischen_Verzerrungen","31181458_Preliminary_Sketch_of_Biquaternions"]}
