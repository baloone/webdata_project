{"id":"316323980_Environmental_Load_Reduction_by_Customization_for_Reuse_with_Additive_Manufacturing","abstract":"Additive manufacturing may promote the customization of products as it is suitable for a small lot and individual production. Because customization increases product value by altering the aesthetic and functional structure of the product without adding any physical objects, it may add new value to the reuse of products. Reuse decreases the environmental load by reducing the new material required, and some parts can be fabricated with a low environmental load by additive manufacturing for customization. In this study, the use of additive manufacturing to customize for reuse is discussed.","authors":["Toshitake Tateno","Shinsuke Kondoh"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia CIRP 61:241-244","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2016.11.219"],"references":["256673191_Intelligent_CAD_in_Manufacturing","223150065_Progress_in_Additive_Manufacturing_and_Rapid_Prototyping","4235750_Proposal_of_Ubiquitous_Disassembly_System_for_Realizing_Reuse_and_Recycling_in_Cooperative_Distributed_Facilities"]}
