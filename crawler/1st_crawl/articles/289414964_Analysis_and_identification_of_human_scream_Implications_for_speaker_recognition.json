{"id":"289414964_Analysis_and_identification_of_human_scream_Implications_for_speaker_recognition","abstract":"In this paper, we present analysis of the characteristics of scream to identify its discriminating features from neutral speech. The impact of screaming on the performance of text independent speaker recognition systems has also been reported. We have observed that speaker recognition systems are not reliable when tested with scream. Also perceptual listeners test reveal that the speaker content in scream is very less for human to distinguish and classify it. This analysis will be useful for development of robust speaker recognition systems and their implementation in real-time situations.","authors":["M.K. Nandwana","J.H.L.
