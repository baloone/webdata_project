{"id":"251551422_A_newly_developed_long_range_positioning_table_system_with_a_sub-nanometer_resolution","abstract":"Demands for nano-positioning over a long range have recently increased in a variety of industries. This paper presents a long range positioning table system with a sub-nanometer resolution. The table system developed is characterized by a motion error-minimized structure, and the table motion is implemented by a cooperative control of the primary and the secondary tables. Successful implementation of a laser interferometer makes it possible to achieve the Abbe's error free measurement and a long range positioning with a sub-nanometer resolution. Experimental results confirm that the table system achieves sub-nanometer positioning over a 150mm range.","authors":["Hidenori Shinno","H. Yoshioka","H.
