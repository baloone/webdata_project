{"id":"223384819_On_modelling_urban_transportation_networks_via_hybrid_Petri_nets","abstract":"In this paper, a class of hybrid Petri nets is shown to provide a valuable model of urban networks of signalised intersections. In fact, such networks can be fruitfully considered to be hybrid systems, where the vehicle flow behaviour is represented by means of a time-driven model, and the traffic light dynamics is represented by an event-driven model. The proposed model has been validated using real-traffic data about the Italian city of Turin. Some relevant experimental results are reported and discussed. Finally, some possible control-oriented applications of the model are described.","authors":["Angela Di Febbraro","Nicola Sacco"],"meta":["October 2004Control Engineering Practice 12(10):1225-1239","DOI:10.1016/j.conengprac.2004.04.008"],"references":["248678918_A_local_traffic_control_policy_which_maximizes_the_overall_travel_capacity_of_an_urban_road_network","220783465_The_Application_of_Petri_Nets_to_the_Modeling_Analysis_and_Control_of_Intelligent_Urban_Traffic_Networks","216813077_Introduction_to_Discrete_Event_Systems","200035244_Handbook_of_Transportation_Science","3928055_Continuous_Petri_nets_models_for_the_analysis_of_traffic_urban_networks","313479677_Hybrid_Petri_Nets","312939529_Models_of_traffic_and_control","285842809_Petri_Nets_Properties_Analysis_and_Applications","279908394_The_SCOOT_on-line_traffic_signal_optimisation_technique_Glasgow","279345396_Traffic_Control","243083443_Delay-minimizing_Settings_for_Fixed-time_Traffic_Signals_at_a_Single_Road_Junction","226263331_Hybrid_Petri_nets","224276800_Hybrid_Petri_nets_for_the_performance_analysis_of_transportation_systems","224073156_A_decentralized_optimal_control_scheme_for_route_guidance_in_urban_road_networks","224073104_Modular_representation_of_urban_traffic_systems_based_on_hybrid_Petri_nets","224010959_Models_of_Freeway_Traffic_and_Control","222474366_Design_by_Petri_nets_of_an_intersection_signal_controller","222281636_Parameter_identification_for_a_traffic_flow_model","220337351_Continuous_and_Hybrid_Petri_Nets","4048052_On_controlling_privileged_vehicles_by_means_of_coordinated_traffic_lights","3971087_Dynamic_models_and_optimal_control_methods_for_route_guidance_in_urban_traffic_networks","3934522_Decentralized_hybrid_intersection_control","3824263_Performance_analysis_of_traffic_networks_based_on_Stochastic_TimedPetri_Net_models","3737756_Application_of_hybrid_techniques_to_the_modelling_of_interurban_road_networks","3153897_Applications_of_Petri_networks_to_transportation_network_modeling","2984167_Analysis_and_Applications_Proceedings_of_the_IEEE_774_541-580"]}
