{"id":"345489744_Structure_Fault-Tolerance_of_the_Generalized_Hypercube","abstract":"Fault-tolerance is an important parameter to measure the performance of a network. However, most works only consider the fault of single vertex and ignore the structure-fault of a network. The generalized hypercube G(mr,mr−1,…,m1) is one key interconnection network with excellent topological properties. In this paper, we study the H-structure fault-tolerance of G(mr,mr−1,…,m1) network by studying its H-structure connectivity and H-substructure connectivity for H∈{K1,M,C3,C4,K4}⁠. Since the generalized hypercube network can be used to construct some data center networks, such as BCube, HyperX, and FBFLY, the results in this paper can be applied not only to interconnection networks but also to data center networks.","authors":["Guijuan Wang","Cheng-Kuan Lin","Baolei Cheng","Jianxi Fan"],"meta":["April 2019The Computer Journal 62(10)","DOI:10.1093/comjnl/bxz023"],"references":["324056928_Structure_connectivity_of_hypercubes","220185761_On_the_extraconnectivity_of_graphs","3048416_Generalized_Hypercube_and_Hyperbus_Structures_for_a_Computer_Network","3043255_Conditional_Connectivity_Measures_for_Large_Multiprocessor_Systems","326081741_Edge_Fault_Tolerance_of_Cartesian_Product_Graphs_on_Super_Restricted_Edge_Connectivity","326081686_A_Kind_of_Conditional_Connectivity_of_Cayley_Graphs_Generated_by_2-trees","325919211_Hamiltonian_cycle_and_path_embeddings_in_3-ary_n_-cubes_based_on_K_1_3_-structure_faults","325479145_The_g-extra_connectivity_and_diagnosability_of_crossed_cubes","323990135_BCDC_A_High-Performance_Server-Centric_Data_Center_Network","323362163_A_Fault-Free_Unicast_Algorithm_in_the_Generalized_Hypercube_with_Restricted_Faulty_Vertices","321933754_Structure_connectivity_and_substructure_connectivity_of_k_-ary_n_-cube_networks","321629412_The_relationship_between_extra_connectivity_and_conditional_diagnosability_of_regular_graphs_under_the_PMC_model","320845746_Structure_fault_tolerance_of_hypercubes_and_folded_hypercubes","310786338_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Diagnosability_of_nk-star_Graphs","308922827_Hamiltonian_Cycle_and_Path_Embeddings_in_k-Ary_n-Cubes_Based_on_Structure_Faults","305749910_The_2-Extra_Connectivity_and_2-Extra_Diagnosability_of_Bubble-Sort_Star_Graph_Networks","305485422_The_-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Arrangement_Graphs","302476581_Vertex-disjoint_paths_in_DCell_networks","301307738_Structure_connectivity_and_substructure_connectivity_of_hypercubes","277960382_On_g-extra_connectivity_of_folded_hypercubes","257145053_Extraconnectivity_of_-ary_-cube_networks","256744864_2323-Extraconnectivities_of_hypercube-like_networks","256721525_A_kind_of_conditional_conneCtivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_unicyclic_graphs","229530874_Conditional_connectivity","229312322_Super-connectivity_and_super-edge-connectivity_for_some_interconnection_networks","222431093_On_reliability_of_the_folded_hypercubes","220318681_Extraconnectivity_of_hypercubes_II","220246023_The_Conditional_Node_Connectivity_Of_The_k-Ary_n-Cube","220115040_Combinatorial_Properties_of_Generalized_Hypercube_Graphs","3042531_Generalized_measure_of_fault_tolerance_with_application_to_N-cubes","2589859_Optimal_Communication_Primitives_On_The_Generalized_Hypercube_Network"]}
