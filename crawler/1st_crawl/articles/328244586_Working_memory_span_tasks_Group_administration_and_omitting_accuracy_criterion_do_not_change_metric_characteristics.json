{"id":"328244586_Working_memory_span_tasks_Group_administration_and_omitting_accuracy_criterion_do_not_change_metric_characteristics","abstract":"The study examined the psychometric characteristics of three automated working memory span tasks: operational, reading, and symmetry span task, administered in groups of participants. For each task, the metric characteristics of six scoring procedures were evaluated: partial, absolute, partial non-weighted, absolute non-weighted, partial weighted, and absolute weighted scoring. Metric characteristics of all measures were compared across two parallel analyses: with and without application of a typical 85% accuracy criterion on the processing component of the tasks. The study demonstrates that the group administration of span tasks does not compromise their psychometric characteristics. All the tasks had an adequate internal consistency with Cronbach’s αs equal to or above .70; the exception being all types of the symmetry span task absolute scores with α values close to .60. Furthermore, all tasks have satisfactory convergent construct validity as well as criterion validity estimated in relation to measures of fluid intelligence. Omitting the 85% accuracy criterion on the processing component of the span tasks did not impair their psychometric properties. Thus, it is recommended that researchers discard this accuracy criterion as a criterion for filtering the results for further statistical analyses.","authors":["Ratko Đokić","Maida Koso","Nermin Đapo"],"meta":["October 2018PLoS ONE 13(10):e0205169","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0205169"],"references":["269190614_The_development_of_a_short_domain-general_measure_of_working_memory_capacity","265608481_Shortened_complex_span_tasks_can_reliably_measure_working_memory_capacity","303919046_Principles_and_Practice_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","303913007_Variation_in_working_memory_capacity_as_variation_in_executive_attention_and_control_in","298016760_Variation_in_Working_Memory","289963776_How_are_visuospatial_working_memory_executive_functioning_and_spatial_abilities_related_A_latent-variable_analyses","285184980_Individual_differences_in_working_memory_capacity_and_retrieval_A_cue-dependent_search_approach","284236292_Working_memory_short-term_memory_and_general_fluid_intelligence_A_latent_variable_approach","265988396_PROVERA_I_VALIDACIJA_POSTUPAKA_MERENJA_OPSEGA_RADNE_MEMORIJE_PRI_CITANJU","260314943_The_mechanisms_of_working_memory_capacity_Primary_memory_secondary_memory_and_attention_control","257255588_Asymmetric_cross-domain_interference_between_two_working_memory_tasks_Implications_for_models_of_working_memory","260296789_E-prime_User's_Guide","255672396_Individual_differences_in_false_recall_A_latent_variable_analysis","232498208_Working_Memory_and_Intelligence_Different_Constructs_Reply_to_Oberauer_et_al_2005_and_Kane_et_al_2005","232488655_Tests_for_Comparing_Elements_of_a_Correlation_Matrix"]}
