{"id":"251265078_New_Technique_for_Decoding_Codes_in_the_Rank_Metric_and_Its_Cryptography_Applications","abstract":"We present two new algorithms for decoding an arbitrary (n, k) linear rank distance code over GF(q\nN\n). These algorithms correct errors of rank r in O((Nr)3q\n(r−1)(k+1)) and O((k + r)3r\n3q\n(r−1)(N−r)) operations in GF(q) respectively. The algorithms give one of the most efficient attacks on public-key cryptosystems based on rank codes, as well as on the authentication scheme suggested by Chen.","authors":["Alexey Urivskiy","Tuula Johansson"],"meta":["July 2002Problems of Information Transmission 38(3):237-246","DOI:10.1023/A:1020369320078"],"references":["235008632_Theory_of_codes_with_maximum_rank_distance_translation","234801344_Ideals_over_a_Non-Commutative_Ring_and_their_Application_in_Cryptology","225156488_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Original_McEliece","221347926_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Solving_Overdefined_Systems_of_Multivariate_Polynomial_Equations","2360166_Efficient_Zero-Knowledge_Authentication_Based_on_a_Linear_Algebra_Problem_MinRank","291038463_Improved_GPT_public_key_cryptosystems","224723573_A_new_family_of_rank_codes_and_applications_to_cryptography","221347896_Ideals_over_a_Non-Commutative_Ring_and_thier_Applications_in_Cryptology","221326908_The_Cryptographic_Security_of_the_Syndrome_Decoding_Problem_for_Rank_Distance_Codes","220914749_A_New_Identification_Algorithm","220139011_Complexity_Issues_in_Coding_Theory","2791140_The_Cryptographic_Security_of_the_Syndrome_Decoding_Problem_for_Rank_Distance_Codes","2398869_The_Security_of_the_Gabidulin_Public_Key_Cryptosystem"]}
