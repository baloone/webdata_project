{"id":"291098899_Tight_Bounds_for_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_Online_Minimum_Steiner_Tree_Problem","abstract":"In this work, we study the advice complexity of the online minimum Steiner tree problem (ST). Given a (known) graph G = (V,E) endowed with a weight function on the edges, a set of N terminals are revealed in a step-wise manner. The algorithm maintains a sub-graph of chosen edges, and at each stage, chooses more edges from G to its solution such that the terminals revealed so far are connected in it. In the standard online setting this problem was studied and a tight bound of O(log(N)) on its competitive ratio is known. Here, we study the power of non-uniform advice and fully characterize it. As a first result we show that using q ·log(|V|) advice bits, where 0 ≤ q ≤ N − 1, it is possible to obtain an algorithm with a competitive ratio of O(log(N/q). We then show a matching lower bound for all values of q, and thus settle the question.","authors":["Kfir Barhum"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-04298-5_8","Conference: International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Informatics"],"references":["234784007_Amortized_efficiency_of_list_update_paging_rules","226657157_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_Online_Problems","225124948_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220779543_Stochastic_analyses_for_online_combinatorial_optimization_problems","267783122_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_Knapsack_Problem","225316095_How_Much_Information_about_the_Future_Is_Needed","221590613_On-Line_Algorithms_for_Steiner_Tree_Problems_Extended_Abstract","220898782_Online_Computation_with_Advice","220689517_Online_Computation_and_Competitive_Analyses","220533709_Dynamic_Steiner_Tree_Problem","2797181_On-line_Steiner_Trees_in_the_Euclidean_Plane","2434388_On-line_Generalized_Steiner_Problem"]}
