{"id":"242806845_Special-purpose_computer_for_holography_HORN3_with_PLD_technology","abstract":"We have designed and built a special-purpose computer for holography, HORN-3 (HOlographic ReconstructioN) using PLD (Programmable Logic Device) technology.We could integrate a pipeline to calculate hologram into one PLD chip, so that we can readily parallelize the system. By mounting two of the PLD chips on a PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) universal board, HORN-3 calculates light intensity at high speed of about 1.2 G flops. The cost of HORN-3 board is 200,000 Japanese yen (1600 US dollar). We obtained 1024Ã— 768 grids hologram from a virtual 3D-image composed of 2500 points in about 60 sec with the HORN-3 system.","authors":["Tomoyoshi Shimobaba","Nobuyuki Masuda","Takashige Sugie","Satoru Hosono"],"meta":["July 2000Computer Physics Communications 130(1):75-82","DOI:10.1016/S0010-4655(00)00044-8"],"references":["2766592_Interactive_Computation_of_Holograms_Using_a_Look-Up_Table","318765510_Experiments_in_holographic_video_imaging","252643886_Elements_of_holographic_video_imaging","243729890_Holography_Machine_HORN1_for_Computer-Aided_Retrieval_of_Virtual_Three-Dimensional_Image","242806744_Special_Purpose_Computer_HORN-1_for_Reconstruction_of_Virtual_Image_in_Three_Dimensions","232272100_Integral_holography","229344824_Special-purpose_computer_for_holography_HORN-2","44649359_Computer_generated_holograms_An_historical_review"]}
