{"id":"257438654_A_Hybrid_Case-Based_and_Content-Based_Retrieval_Engine_for_Mobile_Cancer_Management_System_-_MCMS","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) Engine prototype for Mobile Remote Diagnosis of cancer patients. Moreover, the retrieval in CBR is a very difficult complex task for medical diagnosis. This is due to diagnostic radiology that requires accurate interpretation of complex tumour features in medical images. This may lead to uncertain diagnosis decisions. In this paper, we also propose a new hybrid retrieval algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis. It combines Content-Based Image retrieval CBIR techniques that could be valuable to radiologists in assessing medical images by identifying similar images that could assist with decision support. The proposed retrieval model is applied to FNA breast cancer images and it is tested with 600 radiology images. Cross-validation test has shown an average retrieval accuracy of 90%. The hybrid model is described in the context of a prototype namely, MCMS a hybrid expert system, which integrates CBIR into the CBR.","authors":["Bassant M.
