{"id":"257689186_3D_DNA_origami_designed_with_caDNAno","abstract":"For about three decades, DNA-based nanotechnology has been undergoing development as an assembly method for nanostructured materials. The DNA origami method pioneered by Rothemund paved the way for the formation of 3D structures using DNA self assembly. The origami approach uses a long scaffold strand as the input for the self assembly of a few hundred staple strands into desired shapes. Herein, we present a 3D origami “roller” (75 nm in length) designed using caDNAno software. This has the potential to be used as a template to assemble nanoparticles into different pre-defined shapes. The “roller” was characterized with agarose gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).","authors":["George Amoako","Ming Zhou","RiAn Ye","LiZhou Zhuang"],"meta":["August 2013Chinese Science Bulletin 58(24)","DOI:10.1007/s11434-013-5879-y","Project: DNA Origami and functionalization"],"references":["291801654_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns","221709110_DNA-based_Self-Assembly_of_Chiral_Plasmonic_Nanostructures_with_Tailored_Optical_Response","51385749_DNA-nanotube-induced_alignment_of_membrane_proteins_for_NMR_structure_determination","50227702_A_primer_to_scaffolded_DNA_origami","295169929_Self-assembly_of_DNA_into_Nanoscale_Three-Dimensional_Shapes","231530741_Modifying_the_Surface_Features_of_Two-Dimensional_DNA_Crystals","231525414_Antiparallel_DNA_Double_Crossover_Molecules_As_Components_for_Nanoconstruction","224947612_DNA_Origami_Metallized_Site_Specifically_to_Form_Electrically_Conductive_Nanowires","51859009_Rolling_Up_Gold_Nanoparticle-Dressed_DNA_Origami_into_Three-Dimensional_Plasmonic_Chiral_Nanostructures","51290175_Nucleic_Acid_Junctions_and_Lattices"]}
