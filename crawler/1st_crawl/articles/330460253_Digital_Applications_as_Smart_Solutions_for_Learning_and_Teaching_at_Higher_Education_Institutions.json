The usage of learning analytics and a combination of this approach with mobile devices like tablets and smartphones in particular are relatively new to the German research communities. Thus, a collaborative research project of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University Mannheim and the University of Mannheim explores the short-term and long-term effects, risks, and benefits of the usage of mobile learning analytics in students’ daily life. Using a web app, personal and learning data of students are collected, tracked, and visualized. Besides the fact that the individual learning tracking is very helpful for the students, the lecturers also receive selected information about their students in an anonymous format on a dashboard. For each course, the lecturers obtain specific data about motivation and learning performance of their students. Moreover, students can evaluate the teaching units in real time and give feedback in an anonymous way to their lecturers. The information can be used to adapt the teaching content to the students’ needs and to offer a more personalized learning process for students. Additionally, the teacher-student communication can be enhanced, too. The research project contributes to the growing evidence of learning analytics in Germany and shows how technological approaches can improve the higher education processes for all involved academic stakeholders.","authors":["Luisa Seiler","Matthias Kuhnel","Dirk Ifenthaler","Andrea Honal"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-64792-0_10","In book: Utilizing Learning Analytics to Support Study Success (pp.157-174)"],"references":["321976808_Successful_learning_balancing_self-regulation_with_instructional_planning","320654823_Factors_Impacting_Teachers'_Adoption_of_Mobile_Learning","307143218_Preparing_the_Next_Generation_of_Education_Researchers_for_Big_Data_in_Higher_Education","303443477_Mobile_and_ubiquitous_learning_in_higher_education_settings_A_systematic_review_of_empirical_studies","289537454_Conceptual_Design_of_a_Smart_Classroom_Based_on_Multiagent_Systems","286248373_Definition_framework_and_research_issues_of_smart_learning_environments_-_a_context-aware_ubiquitous_learning_perspective","279654325_Learning_object_repositories_as_knowledge_management_systems","274576375_Conceptualizing_the_emerging_field_of_smart_learning_environments","273762453_Editorial_Learning_design_teacher_inquiry_into_student_learning_and_learning_analytics_A_call_for_action_Learning_design_TISL_and_learning_analytics","271504715_Seven_features_of_smart_learning_analytics_-_lessons_learned_from_four_years_of_research_with_learning_analytics","268367045_Numbers_Are_Not_Enough_Why_e-Learning_Analytics_Failed_to_Inform_an_Institutional_Strategic_Plan","268280461_Mobile_Learning_Perspectives","268148388_Conditions_for_effective_smart_learning_environments","263013168_Educational_Data_Mining_and_Learning_Analytics_Applications_to_Constructionist_Research","258122965_Informing_Pedagogical_Action_Aligning_Learning_Analytics_With_Learning_Design","252422837_Current_State_of_Mobile_Learning","227627458_Technology_Enhanced_Learning_as_a_Tool_for_Pedagogical_Innovation","225140273_Highly_integrated_model_assessment_technology_and_tools","352872877_Student_Privacy_Harm_and_Context","328912290_Mobile_learning_analytics_in_higher_education_Usability_testing_and_evaluation_of_an_app_prototype","327220025_Learning_Analytics_Definitions_Processes_and_Potential","321611025_Assessment_and_Teaching_of_21st_Century_Skills_Methods_and_Approach","319323944_Changing_Education_with_Mobile_Learning","318883462_Learning_Analytics_Design","317647539_Features_Students_Really_Expect_from_Learning_Analytics","317219635_Mobile_Learning_A_Handbook_for_Developers_Educators_and_Learners","315760534_Die_Generation_Y","311718666_Are_Higher_Education_Institutions_Prepared_for_Learning_Analytics","311523662_The_complex_relationship_between_emotions_approaches_to_learning_study_success_and_study_progress_during_the_transition_to_university","306275907_Student_perceptions_of_privacy_principles_for_learning_analytics","288635756_Embracing_big_data_in_complex_educational_systems_The_learning_analytics_imperative_and_the_policy_challenge","281365357_Mobile_learning_Research_practice_and_challenges","262976115_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Learning_Analytics_Framework_Two_Case_Studies_Using_Support_Vector_Machines","262293023_Learning_analytics_Drivers_developments_and_challenges","259934125_Curriculum_Models_for_the_21st_Century_Using_Learning_Technologies_in_Higher_Education","259143623_Mobile_Computing_Devices_in_Higher_Education_Student_Perspectives_on_Learning_with_Cellphones_Smartphones_Social_Media","258689010_Integrated_Platform_for_Mobile_Learning","228096896_Dataset-driven_Research_to_Support_Learning_and_Knowledge_Analytics","221424785_A_Flexible_Mechanism_For_Providing_Adaptivity_Based_On_Learning_Styles_In_Learning_Management_Systems"]}
