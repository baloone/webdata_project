{"id":"262400701_What_is_it_we_are_asking_Interpreting_problem-solving_questions_in_computer_science_and_linguistics","abstract":"The cognitive abilities of learners have been studied extensively in both psychological and educational contexts. In the field of education, attention is placed on high-order thinking strategies, while in computer science education the focus is on cognitive skills required for solving problems. Since any process of problem solving is based on answering questions, it is worth looking at the questions we ask. In this conceptual framework, the current study aims to investigate the cognitive requirements from learners answering questions that arise from the questions' formulation. The study focuses on a linguistic investigation of keywords that appear in questions aimed at promoting the learners' high-order thinking when solving problems. To sharpen our attention to the uses of particular keywords in questions, we present a comparison between questions used in two different disciplines, computer science and linguistics. The paper outlines and describes nine question keyword categories, demonstrates the question keyword categories, and argues that the cognitive requirements from learners answering those questions are very similar for both disciplines.","authors":["Noa Ragonis","Gila Shilo"],"meta":["March 2013","DOI:10.1145/2445196.2445253","Conference: Proceeding of the 44th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education"],"references":["303809631_Bloom's_taxonomy_for_CS_assessment","289805286_Type_of_questions_-_The_case_of_computer_science","281211216_Melioration_as_a_higher_thinking_skill_of_future_intelligence","230751877_Bloom's_taxonomy_for_CS_assessment","226302889_Explicit_teaching_of_meta-strategic_knowledge_in_authentic_classroom_situations","224088695_Relationship_between_examination_questions_and_bloom's_taxonomy","312774800_Teaching_and_Learning_in_a_Community_of_Thinking_The_Context","277836399_A_Linguistic_Analysis_of_Question_Taxonomies_Journal_of_the_American_Society_for_Information_Science_and_Technology_567_715-728","255570709_Research_and_Design_of_Test_Question_Database_Management_System_Based_on_the_Three-Tier_Structure","238382885_Five_themes_in_a_thought-full_curriculum","235465787_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_A_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives","234641473_Developing_Minds_A_Resource_Book_for_Teaching_Thinking","228328451_Taxonomy_of_educational_objectives_Handbook_I_Cognitive_domain","221538966_Principles_of_asking_effective_questions_during_student_problem_solving","220817560_Enhanced_Answer_Type_Inference_from_Questions_using_Sequential_Models","220435193_Linguistic_analysis_of_question_taxonomies","44561699_Evaluating_the_Quality_of_Learning_the_SOLO_Taxonomy","2553954_Parsing_and_Question_Classification_for_Question_Answering"]}
