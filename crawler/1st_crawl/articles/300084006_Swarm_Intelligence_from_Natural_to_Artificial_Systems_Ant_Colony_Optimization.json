{"id":"300084006_Swarm_Intelligence_from_Natural_to_Artificial_Systems_Ant_Colony_Optimization","abstract":"Successful applications coming from biologically inspired algorithm like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)\nbased on artificial swarm intelligence which is inspired by the collective behavior of social insects. ACO\nhas been inspired from natural ants system, their behavior, team coordination, synchronization for the\nsearching of optimal solution and also maintains information of each ant. At present, ACO has emerged as\na leading metaheuristic technique for the solution of combinatorial optimization problems which can be\nused to find shortest path through construction graph. This paper describe about various behavior of ants,\nsuccessfully used ACO algorithms, applications and current trends. In recent years, some researchers\nhave also focused on the application of ACO algorithms to design of wireless communication network,\nbioinformatics problem, dynamic problem and multi-objective problem.","authors":["Deepa O.","Senthilkumar A."],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.5121/jgraphoc.2016.8102"],"references":["277284831_MAX-MIN_ant_system","254462323_Bioinspired_computation_in_combinatorial_optimization_-_Algorithms_and_their_computational_complexity","235439153_Ant_sytem_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","228800511_Elitist_ant_system_for_route_allocation_problem","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","285827119_Multi-agent_coordination_and_control_using_stigmergy","274732323_A_new_rank_based_version_of_the_ant_system_A_computational_study","267799260_A_Recursive_Ant_Colony_System_Algorithm_for_the_TSP","247074873_Optimization_Learning_and_Natural_Algorithms","234778415_Biologically_Inspired_Self-Governance_and_Self-Organisation_for_Autonomic_Networks"]}
