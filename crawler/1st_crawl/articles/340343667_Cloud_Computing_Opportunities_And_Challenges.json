{"id":"340343667_Cloud_Computing_Opportunities_And_Challenges","abstract":"The cloud computing technology is providing the present world with the improved methods of storage, performance of an application and computation. Cloud computing could be described as on-demand availability of the resources of computer system, specifically the data storage as well as the computing power, deprived of any kind of direct active management by users. The opportunities and challenges that are associated with the cloud computing technology will be discussed within the paper.","authors":["Narendra Rao Tadapaneni"],"meta":["January 2018SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3563342"],"references":["322350078_Exploring_Data_Security_Issues_and_Solutions_in_Cloud_Computing","322089150_Computation_Offloading_and_Resource_Allocation_in_Mixed_FogCloud_Computing_Systems_With_Min-Max_Fairness_Guarantee","318671352_Next_Generation_Cloud_Computing_New_Trends_and_Research_Directions","315959194_Privacy-preserving_outsourced_classification_in_cloud_computing","314891569_Homomorphic_Encryption_as_a_Service_for_Outsourced_Images_in_Mobile_Cloud_Computing_Environment","312433091_Mobile_cloud_computing_for_computation_offloading_Issues_and_challenges","305416491_A_Security_Framework_for_Secure_Cloud_Computing_Environments","327370544_NMCDA_A_framework_for_evaluating_cloud_computing_services","325094986_Internetrecht_Vertragliche_und_datenschutzrechtliche_Besonderheiten_beim_Cloud_Computing","322514740_Secure_Data_Storage_and_Searching_for_Industrial_IoT_by_Integrating_Fog_Computing_and_Cloud_Computing","320346181_Cloud_computing_research_A_review_of_research_themes_frameworks_methods_and_future_research_directions","319197372_Energy-aware_task_assignment_for_mobile_cyber-enabled_applications_in_heterogeneous_cloud_computing","313862696_Anonymous_and_secure_aggregation_scheme_in_fog-based_public_cloud_computing","311977851_A_light_weight_authentication_protocol_for_IoT-enabled_devices_in_distributed_Cloud_Computing_environment","311338093_Secure_integration_of_IoT_and_Cloud_Computing"]}
