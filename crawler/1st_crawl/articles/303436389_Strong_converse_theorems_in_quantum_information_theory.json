{"id":"303436389_Strong_converse_theorems_in_quantum_information_theory","abstract":"There are many situations in information theory where it is required to find the threshold value of some relevant quantity for which a kind of error probability can asymptotically be made arbitrarily small. The strong converse property means that when the quantity exceeds the threshold value the error probability inevitably goes to one asymptotically. In quantum information theory, the strong converse property is known for (classical) capacity of quantum memoryless channel ([1, 4]) and for hypothesis testing problem of two quantum i.i.d. states ([2]). In this article we provide new proofs, which are based on a simple and unified argument, with these results. Â© 2005 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved.","authors":["H.
