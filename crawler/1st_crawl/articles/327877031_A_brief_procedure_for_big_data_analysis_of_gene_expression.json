{"id":"327877031_A_brief_procedure_for_big_data_analysis_of_gene_expression","abstract":"There are a lot of biological and experimental data from genomics, proteomics, drug screening, medicinal chemistry, etc. A large amount of data must be analyzed by special methods of statistics, bioinformatics, and computer science. Big data analysis is an effective way to build scientific hypothesis and explore internal mechanism. Here, gene expression is taken as an example to illustrate the basic procedure of the big data analysis.","authors":["Kewei Wang","Wenji Wang","Mang Li"],"meta":["September 2018Animal Models and Experimental Medicine 1(8)","DOI:10.1002/ame2.12028"],"references":["325015144_Tensor_decomposition-based_and_principal-component-analysis-based_unsupervised_feature_extraction_applied_to_the_gene_expression_and_methylation_profiles_in_the_brains_of_social_insects_with_multiple_","324655664_Comparison_of_normalization_methods_for_the_analysis_of_metagenomic_gene_abundance_data","324453691_Empirical_evaluation_of_data_normalization_methods_for_molecular_classification","324433350_Principal_Component_Analysis_based_Imaging_Angle_Determination_for_3D_Motion_Monitoring_using_Single_Slice_On_Board_Imaging","323456495_Analysis_of_Housekeeping_Genes_for_Accurate_Normalization_of_qPCR_Data_During_Early_Postnatal_Brain_Development","323339606_MiRCancerdb_A_database_for_correlation_analysis_between_microRNA_and_gene_expression_in_cancer","323192524_Identification_of_a-fetoprotein-specific_T_cell_receptors_for_hepatocellular_carcinoma_immunotherapy","322898578_A_Bootstrap_Based_Measure_Robust_to_the_Choice_of_Normalization_Methods_for_Detecting_Rhythmic_Features_in_High_Dimensional_Data","324783737_Cluster_Locator_online_analysis_and_visualization_of_gene_clustering","324124668_A_novel_strategy_of_integrated_microarray_analysis_identifies_CENPA_CDK1_and_CDC20_as_a_cluster_of_diagnostic_biomarkers_in_lung_adenocarcinoma"]}
