{"id":"323673909_The_light-sheet_microscopy_revolution","abstract":"This paper reviews the rapid advances that have been made in one form of optical biological imaging in the last decade, namely that of light sheet microscopy. Although the concept was originally presented over one hundred years ago, at the time it was a methodology that lacked the technology to really make it a viable tool for practical everyday imaging in the biologist's laboratory. However, since its re-discovery, it has started to transform in vivo and increasingly intact organ imaging in a number of areas of biology. This review looks back at the beginning of the method and then the crucial role that modern optical technology, frequently developed for other fields, has played in advancing the instrumentation. This paper will also look at the OpenSPIM route that was developed whereby, through the purchase of a few optical components, researchers have been able to develop their own bespoke instruments and we consider if this may be a route forward for the rapid development of other technological breakthroughs.","authors":["John M Girkin","Mariana Torres Carvalho"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Optics 20(5)","DOI:10.1088/2040-8986/aab58a","Project: Development of a new optical system for selective plane image microscopy (SPIM)"],"references":["328673454_Three-photon_light-sheet_fluorescence_microscopy","318432642_Precise_spatio-temporal_control_of_rapid_optogenetic_cell_ablation_with_mem-KillerRed_in_Zebrafish","315878022_triSPIM_light_sheet_microscopy_with_isotropic_super-resolution","309632061_Light-sheet_microscopy_for_everyone_Experience_of_building_an_OpenSPIM_to_study_flatworm_development","336454699_Studying_live_embryos_in_4D_Selective_plane_illumination_microscopy_a_new_technique_for_high-resolution_four-dimensional_imaging","315913239_A_guide_to_light-sheet_fluorescence_microscopy_for_multiscale_imaging","313355532_Single_Objective_Light-Sheet_Microscopy_for_High-Speed_Whole-Cell_3D_Super-Resolution","312669083_An_AutoPilot_platform_for_high-resolution_light-sheet_microscopy","310822480_Light-sheet-based_2D_light_scattering_cytometry_for_label-free_characterization_of_senescent_cells","309617193_Adaptive_illumination_based_on_direct_wavefront_sensing_in_a_light-sheet_fluorescence_microscope"]}
