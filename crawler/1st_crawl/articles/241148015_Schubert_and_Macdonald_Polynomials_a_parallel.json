{"id":"241148015_Schubert_and_Macdonald_Polynomials_a_parallel","abstract":"Schubert and (non-symmetric) Macdonald polynomials are two lin- ear bases of the ring of polynomials which can be characterized by van- ishing conditions. We show that both families satisfy similar branching rules related to the multiplication by a single variable. These rules are sucien t to recover a great part of the theory of Schubert and Mac- donald polynomials.","authors":["Alain Lascoux"],"meta":[],"references":["1855460_On_Polynomials_Interpolating_Between_the_Stationary_State_of_a_On_Model_and_a_QHE_Ground_State","265538124_Interpolation_Integrality_and_a_Generalization_of_Macdonald's_Polynomials","242947335_Combinatorial_formula_for_Macdonald_polynomials_and_generic_Macdonald_polynomials","226769156_Yang-Baxter_Graphs_Jack_and_Macdonald_Polynomials","38385580_Euler-Poincare_Characteristic_and_Polynomial_Representations_of_Iwahori-Hecke_Algebras","2349003_Identities_and_Positivity_Conjectures_for_some_remarkable_Operators_in_the_Theory_of_Symmetric_Functions","2103484_Symmetric_polynomials_vanishing_on_the_shifted_diagonals_and_Macdonald_polynomials"]}
