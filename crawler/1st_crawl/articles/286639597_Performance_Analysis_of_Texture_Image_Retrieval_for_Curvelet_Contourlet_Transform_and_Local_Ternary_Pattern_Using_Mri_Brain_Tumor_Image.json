Brain tumor is an\nabnormal cell or tissue forms within a brain. In this paper, a model based on texture feature is useful to\ndetect the MRI brain tumor images. There are two parts, namely; feature extraction process and\nclassification. First, the texture features are extracted using techniques like Curvelet transform, Contourlet\ntransform and Local ternary pattern (LTP). Second, the supervised learning algorithm like Deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) is used to classify the brain tumor images. The Experiment is performed on a collection of\n1000 brain tumor images with different orientations. Experimental results reveal that contourlet transform\ntechnique provides better than curvelet transform and Local ternary pattern.\nKEYWORDS\nCBIR, Texture, Curvelet, Contourlet, Local ternary pattern and Deep neural network.","authors":["Anbarasa Pandian","Balasubramanian Ramasamy"],"meta":["November 2015International Journal in Foundations of Computer Science & Technology 5(6):33-46","DOI:10.5121/ijfcst.2015.5604"],"references":["251938324_Meticulous_classification_using_support_vector_machine_for_brain_images_retrieval","224708699_Local_Tetra_Patterns_A_New_Feature_Descriptor_for_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval","224198885_Active_Volume_Models_for_Medical_Image_Segmentation","288527771_Image_databases_Search_and_retrieval_of_digital_imagery","282380272_Brain_Tumor_Detection_and_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning_Classifier_on_MRI_Images","260637318_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition_The_Shared_Views_of_Four_Research_Groups","224393526_Brain_pathological_image_retrieval_based_on_correlation_of_visual_feature_and_report-assisted_text","224345838_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval_Using_Curvelet_Transform","224200496_3D_Neurological_Image_Retrieval_with_Localized_Pathology-Centric_CMRGlc_Patterns","222498922_Image_Retrieval_Current_Techniques_Promising_Directions_and_Open_Issues"]}
