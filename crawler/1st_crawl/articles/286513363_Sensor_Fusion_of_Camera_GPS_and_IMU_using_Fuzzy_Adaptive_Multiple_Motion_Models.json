{"id":"286513363_Sensor_Fusion_of_Camera_GPS_and_IMU_using_Fuzzy_Adaptive_Multiple_Motion_Models","abstract":"A tracking system that will be used for Augmented Reality (AR) applications\nhas two main requirements: accuracy and frame rate. The first requirement is\nrelated to the performance of the pose estimation algorithm and how accurately\nthe tracking system can find the position and orientation of the user in the\nenvironment. Accuracy problems of current tracking devices, considering that\nthey are low-cost devices, cause static errors during this motion estimation\nprocess. The second requirement is related to dynamic errors (the end-to-end\nsystem delay; occurring because of the delay in estimating the motion of the\nuser and displaying images based on this estimate. This paper investigates\ncombining the vision-based estimates with measurements from other sensors, GPS\nand IMU, in order to improve the tracking accuracy in outdoor environments. The\nidea of using Fuzzy Adaptive Multiple Models (FAMM) was investigated using a\nnovel fuzzy rule-based approach to decide on the model that results in improved\naccuracy and faster convergence for the fusion filter. Results show that the\ndeveloped tracking system is more accurate than a conventional GPS-IMU fusion\napproach due to additional estimates from a camera and fuzzy motion models. The\npaper also presents an application in cultural heritage context.","authors":["Gazi Erkan Bostanci","Betul Bostanci","Nadia Kanwal","Adrian Clark"],"meta":["April 2018Soft Computing 22(8)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-017-2516-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267936016_Evaluating_the_Performances_of_Adaptive_Kalman_Filter_Methods_in_GPSINS_Integration","261297787_Multi-sensor_navigation_algorithm_using_monocular_camera_IMU_and_GPS_for_large_scale_augmented_reality","259936367_User_Tracking_Methods_for_Augmented_Reality","311439842_User_Tracking_Methods_for_Augmented_Reality","261240757_Vision-based_user_tracking_for_outdoor_augmented_reality","260259673_Probabilistic_Robotics","247404120_Restoration_of_Motion_Picture_Film","243658533_Fuzzy_Logic_With_Engineering_Applications","229466043_Fusion_of_Vision_and_Inertial_Data_for_Motion_and_Structure_Estimation","228887510_On_Accurate_Localization_and_Uncertain_Sensors","224969497_Principles_of_GNSS_Inertial_and_Multisensor_Integrated_Navigation_Systems_Second_Edition","224061485_Localization_and_Mapping_for_Autonomous_Navigation_in_Outdoor_Terrains_A_Stereo_Vision_Approach","228692115_Structure_and_motion_by_fusion_of_inertial_and_vision-based_tracking","228362834_Understanding_and_applying_Kalman_filtering","226756718_Bayesian_Model_Estimation_and_Selection_for_Epipolar_Geometry_and_Generic_Manifold_Fitting"]}
