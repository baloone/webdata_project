{"id":"317299902_Impact_of_cyclostationarity_on_fan_broadband_noise_prediction","abstract":"One of the dominant noise sources of modern Ultra High Bypass Ratio (UHBR) engines is the interaction of the rotor wakes with the leading edges of the stator vanes in the fan stage. While the tonal components of this noise generation mechanism are fairly well understood by now, the broadband components are not. This calls to further the understanding of the broadband noise generation in the fan stage. This article introduces a new extension to the Random Particle Mesh (RPM) method, which accommodates in-depth studies of the impact of cyclostationary wake characteristics on the broadband noise in the fan stage. The RPM method is used to synthesize a turbulence field in the stator domain using a URANS simulation characterized by time-periodic turbulence and mean flow. The rotor-stator interaction noise is predicted by a two-dimensional CAA computation of the stator cascade. The impact of cyclostationarity is decomposed into various effects, which are separately investigated. This leads to the finding that the periodic turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and periodic flow have only a negligible effect on the radiated sound power. The impact of the periodic integral length scale (TLS) is, however, substantial. The limits of a stationary representation of the TLS are demonstrated making this new extension to the RPM method indispensable when background and wake TKE are of comparable level. Good agreement of the predictions with measurements obtained from the 2015 AIAA Fan Broadband Noise Prediction Workshop are also shown.","authors":["Attila Wohlbrandt","Carolin Kissner","Sébastien Guérin"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Sound and Vibration 420:142-164","DOI:10.1016/j.jsv.2018.01.039"],"references":["283172946_Unsteady_Fast_Random_Particle_Mesh_method_for_efficient_prediction_of_tonal_and_broadband_noises_of_a_centrifugal_fan_unit","282832595_Numerical_Predictions_of_TurbulenceCascade-Interaction_Noise_Using_Computational_Aeroacoustics_with_a_Stochastic_Model","269193397_Linear-_and_Non-Linear_Perturbation_Equations_with_Relaxation_Source_Terms_for_Forced_Eddy_Simulation_of_Aeroacoustic_Sound_Generation","258053082_Experimental_and_Numerical_Investigation_of_Turbulence-Airfoil_Noise_Reduction_Using_Wavy_Edges","255992998_The_effect_of_wavy_leading_edges_on_aerofoil-gust_interaction_noise","242711008_Stochastic_approach_to_noise_modeling_for_free_turbulent_flows","225006412_Recent_Progress_In_A_Hybrid-Grid_CFD_Solver_For_Turbomachinery_Flows","224992815_CAA_Broadband_Noise_Prediction_for_Aeroacoustic_Design","222453003_Recursive_implementation_of_the_Gaussian_filter","24298016_Steady_and_Unsteady_Flow_Field_Measurements_Within_a_NASA_22-Inch_Fan_Model","323143519_Numerical_Simulation_of_Aerodynamic_Noise_with_DLR's_aeroacoustic_code_PIANO","321357939_Stochastisches_Verfahren_zur_Simulation_von_Breitbandschall_in_Triebwerkfans","312899272_Noise_measurement_in_cylindrical_fan_ducts","312171819_Impact_of_Bypass_Duct_Bifurcations_on_Fan_Noise","312156297_CAA_broadband_noise_prediction_for_aeroacoustic_design","303601989_A_CAA_Study_of_Turbulence_Distortion_in_Broadband_Fan_Interaction_Noise","299644382_Extension_of_the_Random_Particle_Mesh_method_to_periodic_turbulent_flows_for_fan_broadband_noise_prediction","299644255_Fan_noise_scaling_of_static_data_using_semi-analytical_methods_and_assessment_against_experimental_data","299459729_Analytical_reconstruction_of_isotropic_turbulence_spectra_based_on_the_Gaussian_transform","293636293_The_Impact_of_Low-Speed_Fan_Design_on_Noise_An_Exploratory_Study","271853864_An_advanced_synthetic_eddy_method_for_the_computation_of_aerofoil-turbulence_interaction_noise","269193623_Comparison_of_LES_and_Stochastic_Source_Generation_Methods_for_Aero-_and_Hydro-Acoustic_Design_Guidance","269193616_Reduced_Dimension_Modeling_of_Leading_Edge_Turbulent_Interaction_Noise","269193496_The_Fast_Random_Particle_Method_for_Combustion_Noise_Prediction","268583706_Broadband_Fan_Interaction_Noise_using_Synthetic_Inhomogeneous_Non-stationary_Turbulence","268581700_Sweeping_Sound_Generation_in_Jets_Realized_with_a_Random_Particle-Mesh_Method","263875843_RADIATION_AND_OUTFLOW_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS_FOR_DIRECT_COMPUTATION_OF_ACOUSTIC_AND_FLOW_DISTURBANCES_IN_A_NONUNIFORM_MEAN_FLOW","259902839_A_three-parameter_Langevin_model_for_hot_jet_mixing_noise_prediction","259897857_Simultaneous_Computation_of_Surface_and_Volume_Sources_for_Fan_Broadband_Noise_with_the_Random-Particle-Mesh_Method","259896630_Impact_of_Bypass_Duct_Bifurcations_on_Fan_Noise","256918594_Broadband_trailing-edge_noise_prediction_with_a_stochastic_source_model","256744631_Low-Dissipation_and_Low-Dispersion_Runge-Kutta_Schemes_for_Computational_Acoustics","256744361_Random_particle_methods_applied_to_broadband_fan_interaction_noise","253305814_Diffusion_by_a_Random_Velocity_Field","252918428_High_frequency_thin-airfoil_theory_for_subsonic_flow","245426359_Investigation_of_Rotor_Wake_Turbulence_Through_Cyclostationary_Spectral_Analysis","238949334_A_Finite-Difference_Frequency-Domain_Numerical_Scheme_for_the_Solution_of_the_Gust_Response_Problem","231874010_Influence_of_mean_loading_on_noise_generated_by_the_interaction_of_gusts_with_a_cascade_Downstream_radiation","223414027_Cyclostationarity_Half_a_Century_of_Research","223313323_Computation_of_rotor_wake_turbulence_noise","223239327_Panel_methods_for_airfoils_in_turbulent_flow","222352317_Sound_transmission_and_generation_in_ducts_with_flow","222137690_Broadband_Slat_Noise_Prediction_Based_on_CAA_and_Stochastic_Sound_Sources_from_a_Fast_Random_Particle-Mesh_RPM_Method","51227878_Comparison_of_sound_power_radiation_from_isolated_airfoils_and_cascades_in_a_turbulent_flow","4714864_Dispersion-Relation-Preserving_Finite_Difference_Schemes_for_Computational_Acoustics"]}
