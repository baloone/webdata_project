{"id":"278319475_Handbook_of_Compliant_Mechanisms","abstract":"Compliant mechanisms gain their motion from the deflection of flexible members rather than from traditional bearings and hinges. Advantages of compliant mechanisms include high precision, low cost, and ease of miniaturization. Compliant mechanisms should be designed to avoid fatigue failure and their design is often complicated by nonlinearities. One concept that makes compliant mechanism design possible is that it is possible for something to be both flexible and strong. The selection of material properties, geometry, and boundary conditions are key elements of compliant mechanism design.","authors":["Larry L.
