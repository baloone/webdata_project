{"id":"325183785_Integrating_Biomarkers_in_Social_Stratification_and_Health_Research","abstract":"This article provides an overview of the integration of biomarkers and biological mechanisms in social science models of stratification and health. The goal in reviewing this literature is to highlight research that identifies the social forces that drive inequalities over the life course and across generations. The article is structured in the following way. First, descriptive background information on biomarkers is presented, and second, the general theoretical paradigms that lend themselves to an integrative approach are reviewed. Third, the biomarkers used to capture several biological systems that are most responsive to social conditions are described. Fourth, research that explicates how social exposures \"get under the skin\" to affect physiological functioning and downstream health is discussed, using socioeconomic disadvantage as an illustrative social exposure. The review ends with emerging directions in the use of biomarkers in social science research. This article endeavors to encourage sociologists to embrace biosocial approaches in order to elevate the importance of social factors in biomedical processes and to intervene on the social conditions that create unjust and avoidable inequities.","authors":["Kathleen Mullan Harris","Kristen M.
