{"id":"263091740_Online_Optimization_for_Max-Norm_Regularization","abstract":"Max-norm regularizer has been extensively studied in the last decade as it\npromotes a low rank estimation of the underlying data. However, max-norm\nregularized problems are typically formulated and solved in a batch manner,\nwhich prevents it from processing big data due to possible memory bottleneck.\nIn this paper, we propose an online algorithm for solving max-norm regularized\nproblems that is scalable to large problems. Particularly, we consider the\nmatrix decomposition problem as an example, although our analysis can also be\napplied in other problems such as matrix completion. The key technique in our\nalgorithm is to reformulate the max-norm into a matrix factorization form,\nconsisting of a basis component and a coefficients one. In this way, we can\nsolve the optimal basis and coefficients alternatively. We prove that the basis\nproduced by our algorithm converges to a stationary point asymptotically.\nExperiments demonstrate encouraging results for the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our algorithm.","authors":["Jie Shen","Huan Xu","Ping Li"],"meta":["March 2017Machine Learning 2(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10994-017-5628-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["305386928_Maximum-margin_matrix_factorization","281809114_Dropping_Convexity_for_Faster_Semi-definite_Optimization","272352077_A_Max-Norm_Constrained_Minimization_Approach_to_1-Bit_Matrix_Completion","312210566_Principal_Component_Analysis","289056604_Online_robust_PCA_via_stochastic_optimization","265359068_Optimization_Problems_with_Perturbations_A_Guided_Tour","263582549_Randomized_Block_Coordinate_Descent_for_Online_and_Stochastic_Optimization","263052642_Clustering_Hamming_Embedding_Generalized_LSH_and_the_Max_Norm","260542469_Outlier-robust_PCA_The_high-dimensional_case","256981573_A_Max-Norm_Constrained_Minimization_Approach_to_1-Bit_Matrix_Completion"]}
