{"id":"323950225_Automatic_Hierarchical_Parallelization_of_Linear_Recurrences","abstract":"Linear recurrences encompass many fundamental computations including prefix sums and digital filters. Later result values depend on earlier result values in recurrences, making it a challenge to compute them in parallel. We present a new work- and space-efficient algorithm to compute linear recurrences that is amenable to automatic parallelization and suitable for hierarchical massively-parallel architectures such as GPUs. We implemented our approach in a domain-specific code generator that emits optimized CUDA code. Our evaluation shows that, for standard prefix sums and single-stage IIR filters, the generated code reaches the throughput of memory copy for large inputs, which cannot be surpassed. On higher-order prefix sums, it performs nearly as well as the fastest handwritten code from the literature. On tuple-based prefix sums and digital filters, our automatically parallelized code outperforms the fastest prior implementations.","authors":["Sepideh Maleki","Martin Burtscher"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1145/3173162.3173168","Conference: the Twenty-Third International Conference"],"references":["280680306_Compiling_High_Performance_Recursive_Filters","220184713_GPU-Efficient_Recursive_Filtering_and_Summed-Area_Tables","202260508_A_Work-Efficient_Step-Efficient_Prefix_Sum_Algorithm","2888414_StreamIt_A_Language_for_Streaming_Applications","313645165_Scan_primitives_for_GPU_computing","303773680_Higher-order_and_tuple-based_massively-parallel_prefix_sums","303434283_A_work-efficient_step-efficient_prefix_sum_algorithm","288872805_A_Performance_Comparison_of_Sort_and_Scan_Libraries_for_GPUs","258224378_Efficient_Parallel_Scan_Algorithms_for_GPUs","230554866_Discrete-Time_Signal_Processing","224737542_Efficient_multi-processor_implementation_of_recursive_digital_filters","224483264_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Efficient_Solution_of_a_General_Class_of_Recurrence_Equations","221235976_Fast_scan_algorithms_on_graphics_processors","220507113_Fast_Summed-Area_Table_Generation_and_its_Applications","220431171_The_Organization_of_Computations_for_Uniform_Recurrence_Equations","220431115_An_Efficient_Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Solution_of_a_Tridiagonal_Linear_System_of_Equations","220423320_Data_parallel_algorithms","202260509_Scan_Primitives_for_GPU_Computing","31734687_Digital_Signal_Processing_A_Practical_Guide_for_Engineers_and_Scientists_SW_Smith","3042526_Scans_as_Primitive_Parallel_Operations","2787737_Prefix_Sums_and_Their_Applications"]}
