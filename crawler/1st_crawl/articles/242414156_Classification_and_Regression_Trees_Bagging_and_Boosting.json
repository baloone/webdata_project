{"id":"242414156_Classification_and_Regression_Trees_Bagging_and_Boosting","abstract":"This chapter discusses tree-based classification and regression, as well as bagging and boosting. It introduces some general information of the methods and describes how the methods work. Tree-structured classification and regression are alternative approaches to classification and regression that are not based on assumptions of normality and user-specified model statements, as are some older methods such as discriminant analysis and ordinary least squares regression. Tree-structured classification and regression are nonparametric computationally intensive methods that have greatly increased in popularity during the past several years. They can be applied to data sets having both a large number of cases and a large number of variables, and they are extremely resistant to outliers. Bagging and boosting are general techniques for improving prediction rules. They can be applied to tree-based methods to increase the accuracy of the resulting predictions, although it should be emphasized that they can be used with methods other than tree-based methods, such as neural networks.","authors":["Clifton D.
