It defines a development crisis and presents the new discipline of IT Crisisology, which systematically studies and addresses crises in software production. Essential ingredients of this IT Crisisology discipline include models, methods, tools, patterns and practices. The IT Crisisology framework developed addresses technology, business and human factors; for each kind of factors, it uses a dedicated set of the above-mentioned ingredients. These include tradeoff optimization, agility matrix, models for knowledge transfer and data lifecycle, to name a few. For enterprise scale development, these ingredients are further enhanced and improved. In case of systematic application, the suggested IT Crisisology framework allows for better disciplined, predictable, and manageable software product development, even in the event of a crisis.","authors":["Sergey V Zykov"],"meta":["January 2019Procedia Computer Science 159:1777-1786","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.349"],"references":["265070905_Software_Engineering_is_indeed_in_a_crisis","307817431_Crisis_Management_for_Software_Development_and_Knowledge_Transfer","265159534_There_is_no_software_engineering_crisis"]}
