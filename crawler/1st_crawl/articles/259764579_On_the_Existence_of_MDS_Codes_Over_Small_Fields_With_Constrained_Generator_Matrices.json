{"id":"259764579_On_the_Existence_of_MDS_Codes_Over_Small_Fields_With_Constrained_Generator_Matrices","abstract":"We study the existence over small fields of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS)\ncodes with generator matrices having specified supports (i.e. having specified\nlocations of zero entries). This problem unifies and simplifies the problems\nposed in recent works of Yan and Sprintson (NetCod'13) on weakly secure\ncooperative data exchange, of Halbawi et al. (arxiv'13) on distributed\nReed-Solomon codes for simple multiple access networks, and of Dau et al.\n(ISIT'13) on MDS codes with balanced and sparse generator matrices. We\nconjecture that there exist such $[n,k]_q$ MDS codes as long as $q \\geq n + k -\n1$, if the specified supports of the generator matrices satisfy the so-called\nMDS condition, which can be verified in polynomial time. We propose a\ncombinatorial approach to tackle the conjecture, and prove that the conjecture\nholds for a special case when the sets of zero coordinates of rows of the\ngenerator matrix share with each other (pairwise) at most one common element.\nBased on our numerical result, the conjecture is also verified for all $k \\leq\n7$. Our approach is based on a novel generalization of the well-known Hall's\nmarriage theorem, which allows (overlapping) multiple representatives instead\nof a single representative for each subset.","authors":["Hoang Son Dau","Wentu Song","Chau Yuen"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875141","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234763252_The_complexity_of_matrix_completion","234689322_Balanced_Sparsest_Generator_Matrices_for_MDS_Codes","30763733_A_Random_Linear_Network_Coding_Approach_to_Multicast","261450321_Algorithms_for_weakly_secure_data_exchange","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","258082183_Distributed_Reed-Solomon_Codes_for_Simple_Multiple_Access_Networks","228528216_Optimal_Exchange_of_Packets_for_Universal_Recovery_in_Broadcast_Networks"]}
