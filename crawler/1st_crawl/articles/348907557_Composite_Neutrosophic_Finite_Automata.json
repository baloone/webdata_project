{"id":"348907557_Composite_Neutrosophic_Finite_Automata","abstract":"The idea behind the neutrosophic set is we can connect the concept by dynamics of opposite interacts and its neutral that are uncertain and get common parts. Automata theory is beneficial to solve computational complexity problem and also it is an influential mathematical modeling tool in computer science. Inspired by the concepts of neutrosophic sets and automata theory, here, we are introducing and discussing the algebraic concept of neutrosophic finite automata based on the paper [10]. Generally, composite machines can be achieved by the output of the one machine that will be used as input for another machines. This paper introduced the concept of composite automata under the environment of the neutrosophic set and also examined the box function between the composite neutrosophic finite automata.","authors":["Kavikumar Jacob","Nagarajan Deivanayagampillai","S P Tiwari","Broumi Said"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.4065448"],"references":["348677883_Neutrosophic_Bitopological_Spaces","343863215_m-Polar_Neutrosophic_Topology_with_Applications_to_Multi-_criteria_Decision-Making_in_Medical_Diagnosis_and_Clustering_Analysis","343082018_An_integrated_plithogenic_MCDM_approach_for_financial_performance_evaluation_of_manufacturing_industries","339129587_Neutrosophic_General_Finite_Automata","338850929_On_Single-Valued_Neutrosophic_Ideals_in_Sostak_Sense","337012460_Failure_prioritization_and_control_using_the_neutrosophic_best_and_worst_method","332249025_Restricted_cascade_and_wreath_products_of_fuzzy_finite_switchboard_state_machines","346536352_On_BMBJ-Neutrosophic_ideal_of_Subtraction_Algebra","341602825_A_novel_decision-making_model_for_sustainable_supply_chain_finance_under_uncertainty_environment","338316247_Distinguishable_and_Inverses_of_Neutrosophic_Finite_Automata"]}
