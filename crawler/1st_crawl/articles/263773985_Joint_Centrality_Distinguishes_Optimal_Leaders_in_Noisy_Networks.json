{"id":"263773985_Joint_Centrality_Distinguishes_Optimal_Leaders_in_Noisy_Networks","abstract":"We study the performance of a network of agents tasked with tracking an\nexternal unknown signal in the presence of stochastic disturbances and under\nthe condition that only a limited subset of agents, known as leaders, can\nmeasure the signal directly. We investigate the optimal leader selection\nproblem for a prescribed maximum number of leaders, where the optimal leader\nset minimizes total system error defined as steady-state variance about the\nexternal signal. In contrast to previously established greedy algorithms for\noptimal leader selection, our results rely on an expression of total system\nerror in terms of properties of the underlying network graph. We demonstrate\nthat the performance of any given set of leaders depends on their influence as\ndetermined by a new graph measure of centrality of a set. We define the $joint\n\\; centrality$ of a set of nodes in a network graph such that a leader set with\nmaximal joint centrality is an optimal leader set. In the case of a single\nleader, we prove that the optimal leader is the node with maximal information\ncentrality. In the case of multiple leaders, we show that the nodes in the\noptimal leader set balance high information centrality with a coverage of the\ngraph. For special cases of graphs, we solve explicitly for optimal leader\nsets. We illustrate with examples.","authors":["Katherine E Fitch","Naomi Ehrich Leonard"],"meta":["July 2014IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems 3(99)","DOI:10.1109/TCNS.2015.2481138","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258116423_YeastNet_v3_A_public_database_of_data-specific_and_integrated_functional_gene_networks_for_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","258082456_A_New_Notion_of_Effective_Resistance_for_Directed_Graphs-Part_II_Computing_Resistances","253380196_Interorganizational_Coordination_in_Dynamic_Context_Networks_in_Emergency_Response_Management1","241637238_Algorithms_for_leader_selection_in_large_dynamical_networks_Noise-corrupted_leaders","241637224_Algorithms_for_leader_selection_in_large_dynamical_networks_Noise-free_leaders","235402589_Starling_Flock_Networks_Manage_Uncertainty_in_Consensus_at_Low_Cost","235358694_Algorithms_for_Leader_Selection_in_Stochastically_Forced_Consensus_Networks","232985566_The_Centrality_of_Groups_and_Classes","230609310_A_Supermodular_Optimization_Framework_for_Leader_Selection_Under_Link_Noise_in_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems","226834913_Explicit_inverse_of_a_tridiagonal_k-Toeplitz_matrix","226420782_Resistance_Distance","224627820_Consensus_Filters_for_Sensor_Networks_and_Distributed_Sensor_Fusion","224162038_Coupled_stochastic_differential_equations_and_collective_decision_making_in_the_Two-Alternative_Forced-Choice_task","221043334_Leader_Selection_for_Optimal_Network_Coherence","45660014_Social_interactions_information_use_and_the_evolution_of_collective_migration","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","282500116_Information_Centrality_and_Ordering_of_Nodes_for_Accuracy_in_Noisy_Decision-Making_Networks","271549519_Information_centrality_and_optimal_leader_selection_in_noisy_networks","265372571_On_the_Inverse_of_the_Sum_of_Matrices","264585580_Controllability_Metrics_Limitations_and_Algorithms_for_Complex_Networks","248191474_Uber_Matrizen_aus_positiven_Elementen_II","235892336_Adaptive_Network_Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Leadership_in_Collective_Migration","228167671_Non-Bayesian_Social_Learning","227728968_Where_Do_Good_Innovation_Ideas_Come_From_Exploring_the_Influence_of_Network_Connectivity_on_Innovation_Idea_Quality","225448324_Robustness_analysis_of_leader-follower_consensus","224617178_A_Survey_of_Consensus_Problems_in_Multiagent_Coordination","224162567_Robustness_of_noisy_consensus_dynamics_with_directed_communication","222518281_Distributed_average_consensus_with_least-mean-square_deviation","222120596_Multi-Vehicle_consensus_with_a_time-varying_reference_state","221933030_Murray_R_Consensus_Problems_in_Networks_of_Agents_With_Switching_Topology_and_Time-Delays_IEEE_Trans_Automat_Control_499_1520-1533","220183457_Biharmonic_Distance","216636504_Rethinking_centrality_Methods_and_examples","7389357_BioGRID_A_general_repository_for_interaction_datasets"]}
