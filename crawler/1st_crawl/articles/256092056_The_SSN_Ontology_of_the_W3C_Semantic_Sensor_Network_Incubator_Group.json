{"id":"256092056_The_SSN_Ontology_of_the_W3C_Semantic_Sensor_Network_Incubator_Group","abstract":"The W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator group (the SSN-XG) produced an OWL~2 ontology to describe sensors and observations --- the SSN ontology, available at http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn. The SSN ontology can describe sensors in terms of capabilities, measurement processes, observations and deployments. This article describes the SSN ontology. It further gives an example and describes the use of the ontology in recent research projects.","authors":["Michael Compton","Payam Barnaghi","Luis Bermudez","Raúl García-Castro"],"meta":["December 2012Journal of Web Semantics 17","DOI:10.1016/j.websem.2012.05.003"],"references":["271991859_Using_Linked_Data_in_a_heterogeneous_Sensor_Web_challenges_experiments_and_lessons_learned","268055788_Reasoning_about_Sensors_and_Compositions","305301888_International_Vocabulary_of_Metrology_--_Basic_and_General_Concepts_and_Associated_Terms","283597666_A_contextualised_cognitive_perspective_for_linked_sensor_data_Short_paper","272829850_RDF_Vocabulary_Description_Language_10_RDF_Schema_W3C_Recommendation_10_February_2004","262599413_Short_Paper_Addressing_the_Challenges_of_Semantic_Citizen-Sensing","262217911_Using_explicit_semantic_representations_for_user_programming_of_sensor_devices","251258437_Semantic_Web_Based_Dynamic_Energy_Analysis_and_Forecasts_in_Manufacturing_Engineering","245585215_OGC_Implementation_Specification_07-022r1_Observations_and_Measurements-_Part_1_-_Observation_schema","245585009_OGC_Implementation_Specification_07-000_OpenGIS_Sensor_Model_LanguageSensorML"]}
