{"id":"238625662_Principles_and_Practices_of_Interconnection_Network","abstract":"A deadlock-free routing algorithm can be generated for arbitrary interconnection networks using the concept of virtual channels. A necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock-free routing is the absence of cycles in a channel dependency graph. Given an arbitrary network and a routing function, the cycles of the channel dependency graph can be removed by splitting physical channels into groups of virtual channels. This method is used to develop deadlock-free routing algorithms for k-ary n-cubes, for cube-connected cycles, and for shuffle-exchange networks.","authors":["William J.
