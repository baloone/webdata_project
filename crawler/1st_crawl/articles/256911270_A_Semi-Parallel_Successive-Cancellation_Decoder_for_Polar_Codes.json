{"id":"256911270_A_Semi-Parallel_Successive-Cancellation_Decoder_for_Polar_Codes","abstract":"Polar codes are a recently discovered family of capacity-achieving codes that are seen as a major breakthrough in coding theory. Motivated by the recent rapid progress in the theory of polar codes, we propose a semi-parallel architecture for the implementation of successive cancellation decoding. We take advantage of the recursive structure of polar codes to make efficient use of processing resources. The derived architecture has a very low processing complexity while the memory complexity remains similar to that of previous architectures. This drastic reduction in processing complexity allows very large polar code decoders to be implemented in hardware. An N=217 polar code successive cancellation decoder is implemented in an FPGA. We also report synthesis results for ASIC.","authors":["Camille Leroux","Alexandre J. Raymond","Gabi Sarkis","Warren J.
