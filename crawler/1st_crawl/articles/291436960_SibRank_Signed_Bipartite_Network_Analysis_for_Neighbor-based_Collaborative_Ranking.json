{"id":"291436960_SibRank_Signed_Bipartite_Network_Analysis_for_Neighbor-based_Collaborative_Ranking","abstract":"Collaborative ranking is an emerging field of recommender systems that\nutilizes users' preference data rather than rating values. Unfortunately,\nneighbor-based collaborative ranking has gained little attention despite its\nmore flexibility and justifiability. This paper proposes a novel framework,\ncalled SibRank that seeks to improve the state of the art neighbor-based\ncollaborative ranking methods. SibRank represents users' preferences as a\nsigned bipartite network, and finds similar users, through a novel personalized\nranking algorithm in signed networks.","authors":["Bita Shams","Saman Haratizadeh"],"meta":["January 2016Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 458","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2016.04.025","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281834407_VSRank_A_Novel_Framework_for_Ranking-Based_Collaborative_Filtering","303256986_The_Troll-Trust_Model_for_Ranking_in_Signed_Networks","303256438_Maximum_margin_matrix_factorization_for_collaborative_ranking","293802185_Personalized_Recommendation_on_Multi-Layer_Context_Graph","278701581_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","271913938_Ranking_Nodes_in_Signed_Social_Networks","270401627_A_Conditional_Adaptive_Weighted_Test_Method_for_Confirmatory_Trials","257436769_Folkommender_A_group_recommender_system_based_on_a_graph-based_ranking_algorithm","257404410_PathRank_Ranking_nodes_on_a_heterogeneous_graph_for_flexible_hybrid_recommender_systems","256721184_Unifying_rating-oriented_and_ranking-oriented_collaborative_filtering_for_improved_recommendation"]}
