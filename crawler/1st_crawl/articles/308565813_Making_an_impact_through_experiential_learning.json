{"id":"308565813_Making_an_impact_through_experiential_learning","abstract":"This panel focuses on experiential learning as a foundation of information science education. We critically examine the underlying philosophies, pedagogical attitudes, and specific teaching methods needed to foster a new generation of information science professionals. Spanning the pedagogical spectrum from theory to practice, we analyze how the integration of humanistic and progressive pedagogies, principles of student-centered and facilitative learning, and problem-based projects can contribute to the holistic education of creative leaders and lifelong learners whose skills and knowledge are congruent with the fluid and complex character of our field. Drawing on a combined framework from several theoretical studies in adult education, we examine the potential impact of experiential learning on the conception and perception of learning in higher education, on the information science curriculum, and on the nature of the student-teacher relationship. In the spirit of the panel, we invite the session attendees to reflect on the introduced ideas in application to their own pedagogical practices, teaching styles, and courses through several interactive exercises and group discussions. These activities illustrate how experiential learning presents a basis for change in information science education.","authors":["John M. Budd","Clara M.
