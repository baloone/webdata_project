{"id":"260483189_Isoperimetry_and_Stability_Properties_of_Balls_with_Respect_to_Nonlocal_Energies","abstract":"We obtain a sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequality for nonlocal\n$s$-perimeters, uniform with respect to $s$ bounded away from $0$. This allows\nus to address local and global minimality properties of balls with respect to\nthe volume-constrained minimization of a free energy consisting of a nonlocal\n$s$-perimeter plus a non-local repulsive interaction term. In the particular\ncase $s =1$ the $s$-perimeter coincides with the classical perimeter, and our\nresults improve the ones of Kn\\\"upfer and Muratov concerning minimality of\nballs of small volume in isoperimetric problems with a competition between\nperimeter and a nonlocal potential term. More precisely, their result is\nextended to its maximal range of validity concerning the type of nonlocal\npotentials considered, and is also generalized to the case where local\nperimeters are replaced by their nonlocal counterparts.","authors":["Alessio Figalli","Nicola Fusco","Francesco Maggi","Vincent Millot"],"meta":["March 2014Communications in Mathematical Physics","DOI:10.1007/s00220-014-2244-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268028066_Stability_in_the_Isoperimetric_Problem_for_Convex_or_Nearly_Spherical_Domains_in_R_n","345654179_Hypersingular_Integrals_and_Their_Applications","268340080_Hypersingular_Integrals_and_Their_Applications","267969553_Ensembles_quasi-minimaux_avec_contrainte_de_volume_et_rectifiabilite_uniforme_Quasi-minimal_sets_with_a_volume_constraint_and_uniform_rectifiability","266705915_Minimal_Surfaces_and_Functions_of_Bounded_Variation","266587166_A_First_Course_in_Sobolev_Spaces","265464039_Hypersingular_Integrals_and_Their_Applications","264906837_Sets_of_Finite_Perimeter_and_Geometric_Variational_Problems_An_Introduction_to_Geometric_Measure_Theory","259536791_On_an_Isoperimetric_Problem_with_a_Competing_Nonlocal_Term_II_The_General_Case","259536790_Nonexistence_of_a_Minimizer_for_Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-von_Weizsacker_Model","250613927_Local_and_Global_Minimality_Results_for_a_Nonlocal_Isoperimetric_Problem_on_mathbbRN","259149209_Spherical_Harmonics","246831234_Minimial_surfaces_and_functions_of_bounded_variation_Birkhauser_Verlag","243963938_Regularity_and_Bernstein-type_results_for_nonlocal_minimal_surfaces","243697813_Lectures_on_Geometric_Measure_Theory"]}
