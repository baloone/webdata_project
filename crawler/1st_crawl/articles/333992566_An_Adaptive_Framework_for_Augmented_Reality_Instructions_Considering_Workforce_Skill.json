{"id":"333992566_An_Adaptive_Framework_for_Augmented_Reality_Instructions_Considering_Workforce_Skill","abstract":"Human resources have always been a key component in manufacturing systems. The digital transformation of modern shop floor undoubtedly induced the evolution of new requirements in workforce skills. In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) has arisen as a promising technology for knowledge transfer across the factory. AR applications need to be tailored into the workforce skills, considering their limited experience. This paper presents an approach for AR instruction generation, adaptive to the shop floor operatorsâ€™ level of experience, to assist them in production machinery operation. The proposed framework is validated in a press brake manufacturer use case.","authors":["Dimitris Mourtzis","Fotini Xanthi","Vasilios Zogopoulos"],"meta":["January 2019Procedia CIRP 81:363-368","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2019.03.063"],"references":["319383974_Integrated_Production_and_Maintenance_Scheduling_Through_Machine_Monitoring_and_Augmented_Reality_An_Industry_40_Approach","318353574_Augmented_Reality_Application_to_Support_Remote_Maintenance_as_a_Service_in_the_Robotics_Industry","261989411_Simulation_in_Manufacturing_Review_and_Challenges","319862710_The_Role_of_Augmented_Reality_in_the_Age_of_Industry_40","312640589_Cloud-based_Augmented_Reality_Remote_Maintenance_through_shop-floor_Monitoring_A_PSS_approach","258554830_The_evolution_of_manufacturing_systems_From_craftsmanship_to_the_era_of_customisation"]}
