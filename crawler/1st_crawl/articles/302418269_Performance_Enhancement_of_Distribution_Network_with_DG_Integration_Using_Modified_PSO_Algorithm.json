{"id":"302418269_Performance_Enhancement_of_Distribution_Network_with_DG_Integration_Using_Modified_PSO_Algorithm","abstract":"This paper addresses performance enhancement of distribution network with distributed generator (DG) integration using modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The effort of performance enhancement is done by using optimization of distribution network configuration. The objective of the optimization is minimizing active power loss and improving voltage profile while the distribution network is maintained in the radial structure. In this study, configuration optimization method is based on a modified PSO algorithm. The method has been tested in an IEEE model of 33-bus radial distribution network test system and a reallife radial distribution network of 60-bus Bantul distribution system, Indonesia. The simulation results show the importance of reconfiguring the network for enhancing the distribution network performance in the presence of DG.","authors":["Rahmat Jaya Eka Syahputra","Indah Soesanti","Mochamad Ashari"],"meta":["March 2016Journal of Electrical Systems 12(1):1-19"],"references":["291001427_Reconfiguration_of_Distribution_Network_with_Distributed_Energy_Resources_Integration_Using_PSO_Algorithm","285682178_Distribution_Network_Efficiency_Improvement_Based_on_Fuzzy_Multi-objective_Method","276197711_Performance_Analysis_of_Wind_Turbine_as_a_Distributed_Generation_Unit_In_Distribution_System","271462101_Portable_smart_sorting_and_grading_machine_for_fruits_using_computer_vision","301408265_Optimal_distribution_network_reconfiguration_with_penetration_of_distributed_energy_resources","286647419_Optimal_sitting_and_sizing_of_capacitor_banks_in_distribution_networks_using_heuristic_algorithms","286049661_Optimization_of_Distribution_Network_Configuration_with_Integration_of_Distributed_Energy_Resources_Using_Extended_Fuzzy_Multi-Objective_Method","285186947_Multi-band_power_system_stabilizer_model_for_power_flow_optimization_in_order_to_improve_power_system_stability","279230398_Performance_Improvement_of_Radial_Distribution_Network_with_Distributed_Generation_Integration_Using_Extended_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm","278922496_A_new_approach_for_distribution_feeder_reconfiguration_for_loss_reduction_and_service_restoration"]}
