{"id":"281647216_Digital_Games_Research_A_Survey_Study_on_an_Emerging_Field_and_Its_Prevalent_Debates","abstract":"Digital games have become a popular form of media entertainment. However, it remains unclear whether a canon of accepted knowledge and research practices has emerged that may define an independent field of research. The present study is a collaborative effort to analyze the outlines of digital games research (DGR) through a survey among the membership of three institutionalized structures focusing on the study of digital games (ICA Game Studies IG, ECREA TWG Digital Games Research, and DiGRA). The study reveals relatively homogeneous viewpoints among games researchers, even regarding controversial aspects of digital games. It\nmirrors the mainstream scholarly views on contentious issues of a recently emerged field within communication studies.","authors":["Thorsten Quandt","Jan Van Looy","Jens Vogelgesang","Malte Elson"],"meta":["October 2015Journal of Communication 65(6)","DOI:10.1111/jcom.12182"],"references":["311453014_Age_Aging_and_Age_Structure_in_Science","299175191_From_Fermentation_to_Maturity_Reflections_on_Media_and_Communication_Studies_An_Interview_with_Todd_Gitlin_Jostein_Gripsrud_Michael_Schudson","280759024_There_is_broad_consensus_Media_researchers_agree_that_violent_media_increase_aggression_in_children_and_pediatricians_and_parents_concur","265600263_Video_Games_as_a_Multifaceted_Medium_A_Review_of_Quantitative_Social_Science_Research_on_Video_Games_and_a_Typology_of_Video_Game_Research_Approaches","298852493_The_Matthew_Effect_in_Science","277815637_The_Matthew_effect_in_science","273947544_An_Introduction_to_Game_Studies_Games_in_Culture","273947422_Perceiving_play_the_art_and_study_of_computer_games","271963316_How_to_be_a_gamer_Exploring_personal_and_social_indicators_of_gamer_identity","270162336_In_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions"]}
