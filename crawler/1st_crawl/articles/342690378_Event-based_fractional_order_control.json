{"id":"342690378_Event-based_fractional_order_control","abstract":"The present study provides a generalization of event-based control to the field of fractional calculus, combining the benefits brought by the two approaches into an industrial-suitable control strategy. During recent years, control applications based on fractional order differintegral operators have gained more popularity due to their proven superior performance when compared to classical, integer order, control strategies. However, the current industrial setting is not yet prepared to fully adapt to complex fractional order control implementations that require hefty computational resources; needing highly-efficient methods with minimum control effort. The solution to this particular problem lies in combining benefits of event-based control such as resource optimization and bandwidth allocation with the superior performance of fractional order control. Theoretical and implementation aspects are developed in order to provide a generalization of event-based control into the fractional calculus field. Different numerical examples validate the proposed methodology, providing a useful tool, especially for industrial applications where the event-based control is most needed. Several event-based fractional order implementation possibilities are explored, the final result being an event-based fractional order control methodology.","authors":["Isabela Roxana Birs","Ioan Nascu","Clara Mihaela Ionescu","Cristina Muresan"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Advanced Research 25","DOI:10.1016/j.jare.2020.06.024"],"references":["340324253_An_Experimental_Tuning_Approach_of_Fractional_Order_Controllers_in_the_Frequency_Domain","337823110_Event-based_coordinated_control_of_spacecraft_formation_flying_under_limited_communication","341355655_Direct_Discretization_Method_for_Realizing_a_Class_of_Fractional_Order_System_in_Delta_Domain_-_a_Unified_Approach","339722076_Passivity_analysis_for_singular_systems_with_randomly_occurring_uncertainties_via_the_event-based_sliding_mode_control","338977042_Event-based_state-space_model_predictive_control_of_a_renewable_hydrogen-based_microgrid_for_office_power_demand_profiles","337841845_Implementation_of_Simplified_Fractional-Order_PID_Controller_Based_on_Modified_Oustaloup's_Recursive_Filter","336152670_Reduced-order_GPIO_based_dynamic_event-triggered_tracking_control_of_a_networked_one-DOF_link_manipulator_without_velocity_measurement","336012585_Performance_Analysis_of_Solid-State_Fractional_Capacitor-Based_Analog_hbox_PIlambda_hbox_Dmu_PI_l_D_m_Controller","335784803_A_New_Event-Based_PI_Controller_Using_Evolutionary_Algorithms","330584501_Design_of_a_Generalized_Fractional-Order_PID_Controller_Using_Operational_Amplifiers"]}
