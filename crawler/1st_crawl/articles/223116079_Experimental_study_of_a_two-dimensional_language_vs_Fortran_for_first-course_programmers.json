{"id":"223116079_Experimental_study_of_a_two-dimensional_language_vs_Fortran_for_first-course_programmers","abstract":"The variability in programming performance for a group of novice Fortran programmers was measured over a set of problems from an introductory programming text. A wide variation was observed despite the elementary nature of each problem and the relatively homogeneous subject group. The implications of these results are examined. Another experiment measured the comparative performance of programming novices using Fortran and the Klerer-May two-dimensional (2-D) language. The results indicated that the 2-D language was much more economically efficient than Fortran for the subject groups in the areas of scientific/engineering application programming.","authors":["Melvin Klerer"],"meta":["May 1984International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 20(5):445-467","DOI:10.1016/S0020-7373(84)80021-8","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220422160_Experimental_Investigations_of_the_Utility_of_Detailed_Flowcharts_in_Programming","264799709_The_Psychology_Of_Computer_Programming","234824441_The_economics_politics_and_sociology_of_two-dimensional_systems","3472996_On_the_statistics_of_individual_variations_of_productivity_in_research_laboratories_Proc_IRE_453279-290_DOI_101109JRPROC1957278364"]}
