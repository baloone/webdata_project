{"id":"289952634_A_Scientometric_analysis_of_computer_science_research_in_India","abstract":"This paper presents results of our Scientometrics and text-based analysis of computer science research output from India during the last 25 years. We have collected the data for research output indexed in Scopus and performed a detailed computational analysis to obtain important indicators, such as total research output, citation impact, collaboration patterns, top institutions/authors/publication sources. We also performed a text-based analysis on keywords of all papers indexed in Scopus to identify thematic trends during the period. The analytical results present a detailed and useful picture of status and competence of CS domain research in India.","authors":["Sumit Kumar Banshal","Khushboo Singhal","Ashraf Uddin","Vivek Kumar Singh"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1109/IC3.2015.7346675","Conference: Eighth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3), 2015At: Noida, India","Project: Country Level Research Competence Assessment"],"references":["281970612_The_information_technology_knowledge_infrastructure_and_research_in_South_Asia","277941134_Computer_science_research_the_top_100_institutions_in_India_and_in_the_world","273518306_A_Quantity-Quality_Composite_Ranking_of_Indian_Institutions_in_CS_Research","266160151_Measuring_research_output_and_collaboration_in_South_Asian_countries","220364548_Mapping_of_Indian_computer_science_research_output_1999-2008","271995403_Mapping_the_Computer_Science_Research_in_SAARC_Countries"]}
