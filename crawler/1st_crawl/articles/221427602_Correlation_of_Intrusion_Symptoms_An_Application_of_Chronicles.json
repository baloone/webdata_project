{"id":"221427602_Correlation_of_Intrusion_Symptoms_An_Application_of_Chronicles","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a multi-alarm misuse correlation component based on the chronicles formalism. Chronicles provide a high level declarative language and a recognition system that is used in other areas where dynamic systems are monitored. This formalism allows us to reduce the number of alarms shipped to the operator and enhances the quality of the diagnosis provided.","authors":["Benjamin Morin","Herv√© Debar"],"meta":["September 2003Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-45248-5_6","SourceDBLP","Conference: Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection, 6th International Symposium, RAID 2003, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, September 8-10, 2003, Proceedings"],"references":["312994459_Situation_recognition_Representation_and_algorithms","225435583_Alarm_driven_supervision_for_telecommunication_network_II_-_On-line_chronicle_recognition","352121689_Suivi_d'evolutions_et_reconnaissance_de_chroniques_Evolution_Monitoring_and_Chronicle_Recognition","317148131_Alarm_Driven_Monitoring_Based_on_Chronicles","223536598_Temporal_Constraint_Networks","223331028_Temporal_logics_in_AI_Semantical_and_ontological_considerations","222529878_Data_mining_analysis_of_RTID_alarms","222440284_A_Temporal_Logic_for_Reasoning_About_Processes_And_Plans","222074322_A_Non-Reified_Temporal_Logic","221427676_From_Declarative_Signatures_to_Misuse_IDS"]}
