{"id":"265414909_First_Order_Transition_for_the_Optimal_Search_Time_of_Levy_Flights_with_Resetting","abstract":"We study analytically an intermittent search process in one dimension. There\nis an immobile target at the origin and a searcher undergoes a discrete time\njump process starting at $x_0\\geq0$, where successive jumps are drawn\nindependently from an arbitrary jump distribution $f(\\eta)$. In addition, with\na probability $0\\leq r \\leq1$ the position of the searcher is reset to its\ninitial position $x_0$. The efficiency of the search strategy is characterized\nby the mean time to find the target, i.e., the mean first passage time (MFPT)\nto the origin. For arbitrary jump distribution $f(\\eta)$, initial position\n$x_0$ and resetting probability $r$, we compute analytically the MFPT. For the\nheavy-tailed L\\'evy stable jump distribution characterized by the L\\'evy index\n$0<\\mu < 2$, we show that, for any given $x_0$, the MFPT has a global minimum\nin the $(\\mu,r)$ plane at $(\\mu^*(x_0),r^*(x_0))$. We find a remarkable\nfirst-order phase transition as $x_0$ crosses a critical value $x_0^*$ at which\nthe optimal parameters change discontinuously. Our analytical results are in\ngood agreement with numerical simulations.","authors":["Lukasz Kusmierz","Satya N.
