{"id":"301898185_Fast_Computation_of_Isomorphisms_Between_Finite_Fields_Using_Elliptic_Curves","abstract":"We propose a randomized algorithm to compute isomorphisms between finite fields using elliptic curves. To compute an isomorphism between two fields of cardinality $q^n$, our algorithm takes $\\widetilde{O}\\left(n \\log^2 q + \\max_{\\ell} (\\ell^{n_\\ell + 1} \\log^2 q + \\ell \\log^5q)\\right)$ time, where $\\ell$ runs through primes dividing $n$ but not $q(q-1)$ and $n_\\ell$ denotes the highest power of $\\ell$ dividing $n$. Prior to this work, the best known run time dependence on $n$ was quadratic. Our run time dependence on $n$ is at worst quadratic but is subquadratic if $n$ has no large prime factor. In particular, the $n$ for which our run time is linear in $n$ have natural density at least $3/10$.The crux of our approach is finding preimages under the Lang map on elliptic curves over finite fields. We formulate a computational problem concerning Lang maps whose resolution would solve the finite field isomorphism problem with run time linear in $n$.","authors":["Anand Kumar Narayanan"],"meta":["April 2016"],"references":["226693829_Computing_Frobenius_maps_and_factoring_polynomials","45850819_Fast_construction_of_irreducible_polynomials_over_finite_fields_version_of_22_Apr","265821271_A_New_Algorithm_for_Factoring_Polynomials_Over_Finite_Fields","247040412_On_the_group_orders_of_elliptic_curves_over_nite_elds","239524620_A_Heuristic_Quasi-Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Discrete_Logarithm_in_Finite_Fields_of_Small_Characteristic","2818852_Efficient_Computation_of_Minimal_Polynomials_in_Algebraic_Extensions_of_Finite_Fields","2501024_Fast_Polynomial_Factorization_Over_High_Algebraic_Extensions_of_Finite_Fields"]}
