{"id":"311478258_Sabotage_Modal_Logic_Some_Model_and_Proof_Theoretic_Aspects","abstract":"We investigate some model and proof theoretic aspects of sabotage modal logic. The first contribution is to prove a characterization theorem for sabotage modal logic as the fragment of first-order logic which is invariant with respect to a suitably defined notion of bisimulation (called sabotage bisimulation). The second contribution is to provide a sound and complete tableau method for sabotage modal logic. We also chart a number of open research questions concerning sabotage modal logic, aiming at integrating it within the current landscape of logics of model update.","authors":["Guillaume Aucher","Johan van Benthem","Davide Grossi"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-48561-3_1","Conference: International Workshop on Logic, Rationality and Interaction"],"references":["266733236_Swap_logic","260345515_Moving_Arrows_and_Four_Model_Checking_Results","228902774_Global_and_Local_Graph_Modifiers","222427755_A_Game_Theoretic_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Dynamic_Networks","344486660_Modal_Logic","259810884_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","259810774_Logical_Dynamics_of_Information_and_Interaction","259417593_Arrow_update_logic","225109703_An_Essay_on_Sabotage_and_Obstruction","221583315_Model_Checking_and_Satisfiability_for_Sabotage_Modal_Logic"]}
