{"id":"275222742_Project_Knowledge_Management_How_Organizations_Learn_from_Experience","abstract":"This paper aims to examine knowledge management described in literature and investigate how it is managed and applied in organizations. In particular the research focuses on project knowledge management and how organizations turn into practice learning from experience in order to capture, share and save knowledge in time. Both failures and success stories are sources of new knowledge that can be lost if not captured and stored by those who have experienced a specific situation, and shared with all others who have worked on the project or will work on the future ones.","authors":["Mariya Terzieva"],"meta":["December 2014Procedia Technology 16(8):1086-1095","DOI:10.1016/j.protcy.2014.10.123"],"references":["284832716_Why_knowledge_management_fails","242521002_Successful_Sharing_of_Project_Knowledge_Initiation_Implementation_and_Institutionalisation","345003217_Computer-Mediated_Knowledge_Sharing","344727456_Knowledge_Retention_Strategies_and_Solutions","284832580_Ten_steps_to_build_a_Knowledge_Asset","251880197_The_Knowledge_Creating_Company","247174109_Linking_Improved_Knowledge_Management_to_Operational_and_Organizational_Performance","235313636_Putting_Learning_Styles_to_Work_An_Integrated_Approach","234792723_Project_Retrospectives_A_Handbook_for_Team_Reviews","228018507_The_Dance_of_Change_The_Challenges_to_Sustaining_Momentum_in_a_Learning_Organization"]}
