{"id":"323410413_Multi-Goal_Reinforcement_Learning_Challenging_Robotics_Environments_and_Request_for_Research","abstract":"The purpose of this technical report is two-fold. First of all, it introduces a suite of challenging continuous control tasks (integrated with OpenAI Gym) based on currently existing robotics hardware. The tasks include pushing, sliding and pick & place with a Fetch robotic arm as well as in-hand object manipulation with a Shadow Dexterous Hand. All tasks have sparse binary rewards and follow a Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework in which an agent is told what to do using an additional input. The second part of the paper presents a set of concrete research ideas for improving RL algorithms, most of which are related to Multi-Goal RL and Hindsight Experience Replay.","authors":["Matthias Plappert","Marcin Andrychowicz","Alex Ray","Bob McGrew"],"meta":["February 2018"],"references":["318488172_Reverse_Curriculum_Generation_for_Reinforcement_Learning","317399634_Parameter_Space_Noise_for_Exploration","317300199_Interpolated_Policy_Gradient_Merging_On-Policy_and_Off-Policy_Gradient_Estimation_for_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning","303859091_Safe_and_Efficient_Off-Policy_Reinforcement_Learning","281670459_Continuous_control_with_deep_reinforcement_learning","281100388_Universal_Value_Function_Approximators","261353949_MuJoCo_A_physics_engine_for_model-based_control","321510889_Hierarchical_Actor-Critic","321125046_Hindsight_policy_gradients","319770330_Prioritized_Experience_Replay","318652786_A_Distributional_Perspective_on_Reinforcement_Learning","318584439_Proximal_Policy_Optimization_Algorithms","318224066_Hindsight_Experience_Replay","316429214_Equivalence_Between_Policy_Gradients_and_Soft_Q-Learning","309738235_Learning_to_Play_in_a_Day_Faster_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_by_Optimality_Tightening","272837232_Human-level_control_through_deep_reinforcement_learning","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization"]}
