{"id":"326526754_Beating_the_channel_capacity_limit_for_superdense_coding_with_entangled_ququarts","abstract":"Quantum superdense coding protocols enhance channel capacity by using shared quantum entanglement between two users. The channel capacity can be as high as 2 when one uses entangled qubits. However, this limit can be surpassed by using high-dimensional entanglement. We report an experiment that exceeds the limit using high-quality entangled ququarts with fidelities up to 0.98, demonstrating a channel capacity of 2.09 Â± 0.01. The measured channel capacity is also higher than that obtained when transmitting only one ququart. We use the setup to transmit a five-color image with a fidelity of 0.952. Our experiment shows the great advantage of high-dimensional entanglement and will stimulate research on high-dimensional quantum information processes.","authors":["Xiao-Min Hu","Yu Guo","B. H.
