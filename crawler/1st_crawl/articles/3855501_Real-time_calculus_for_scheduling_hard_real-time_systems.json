{"id":"3855501_Real-time_calculus_for_scheduling_hard_real-time_systems","abstract":"This paper establishes a link between three areas, namely Max-Plus\nLinear System Theory as used for dealing with certain classes of\ndiscrete event systems, Network Calculus for establishing time bounds in\ncommunication networks, and real-time scheduling. In particular, it is\nshown that important results from scheduling theory can be easily\nderived and unified using Max-Plus Algebra. Based on the proposed\nnetwork theory for real-time systems, the first polynomial algorithm for\nthe feasibility analysis and optimal priority assignment for a general\ntask model is derived","authors":["L.
