{"id":"223568384_Minimizing_the_size_of_an_identifying_or_locating-dominating_code_in_a_graph_is_NP-hard","abstract":"Let G=(V,E) be an undirected graph and C a subset of vertices. If the sets Br(v)∩C, v∈V (respectively, v∈V⧹C), are all nonempty and different, where Br(v) denotes the set of all points within distance r from v, we call C an r-identifying code (respectively, an r-locating-dominating code). We prove that, given a graph G and an integer k, the decision problem of the existence of an r-identifying code, or of an r-locating-dominating code, of size at most k in G, is NP-complete for any r.","authors":["Irène Charon","Olivier Hudry","Antoine Lobstein"],"meta":["January 2003Theoretical Computer Science 290(3):2109-2120","DOI:10.1016/S0304-3975(02)00536-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220533096_Bounds_for_Codes_Identifying_Vertices_in_the_Hexagonal_Grid","2400258_On_a_New_Class_of_Codes_for_Identifying_Vertices_in_Graphs","284688210_On_identifying_codes","264960215_Locating_dominating_sets_in_series_parallel_networks","242619830_Fundamentals_of_Domination_in_Graphs"]}
