{"id":"322728587_Performance_Analysis_of_ACO_on_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","abstract":"The Quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is to assign a set of facilities to a set of locations with given distances between the locations and given flows between the facilities such that the sum of the products between flows and distances is minimized, which is a notoriously difficult NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. A lot of heuristics have been proposed for the QAP problem, and some of them have proved to be efficient approximation algorithms for this problem. Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a general-purpose heuristic and usually considered as an approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems. However, we know little about the performance of ACO for QAP from a theoretical perspective. This paper contributes to a theoretical understanding of ACO on the QAP problem. The worst-case bound on a simple ACO algorithm called (1+1) Max-min ant algorithm ((1+1) MMAA) for the QAP problem is presented. It is shown that a degenerate (1+1) MMAA finds an approximate solution on the QAP problem. Finally, we reveal that ACO can outperform the 2-exchange local search algorithm on an instance of the QAP problem.","authors":["Xiaoyun Xia","Yuren Zhou"],"meta":["January 2018Chinese Journal of Electronics 27(1):26-34","DOI:10.1049/cje.2017.06.004"],"references":["308953674_Ant_Colony_Optimization","277284831_MAX-MIN_ant_system","249847990_Runtime_Analysis_of_a_Simple_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Algorithm","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","304637709_MMAS_Versus_Population-Based_EA_on_a_Family_of_Dynamic_Fitness_Functions","296472738_Robustness_of_Ant_Colony_Optimization_to_Noise","294738201_Methods_for_the_Analysis_of_Evolutionary_Algorithms_on_Pseudo-Boolean_Functions","294738102_On_the_Analysis_of_the_1_1_Evolutionary_Algorithm","284382099_P-complete_approximation_problem","238344828_Runtime_analysis_of_the_1ANT_ant_colony_optimizer","225147540_Runtime_Analysis_of_Ant_Colony_Optimization_with_Best-So-Far_Reinforcement","224575768_Runtime_Analysis_of_an_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Algorithm_for_TSP_Instances","223201321_Ant_Colony_Optimization_and_the_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problem","222529778_A_running_time_analysis_of_an_Ant_Colony_Optimization_algorithm_for_shortest_paths_in_directed_acyclic_graphs","220569193_On_the_Quality_of_Local_Search_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","220472383_First_steps_to_the_runtime_complexity_analysis_of_ant_colony_optimization","220058911_Mathematical_runtime_analysis_of_ACO_algorithms_Survey_on_an_emerging_issue","220058883_Theoretical_analysis_of_two_ACO_approaches_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","47843232_Analysis_of_Different_MMAS_ACO_Algorithms_on_Unimodal_Functions_and_Plateaus","4860054_Assignment_Problems_and_the_Location_of_Economic_Activity"]}
