{"id":"330811988_INTRODUCTION_TO_COMPUTER_VISION_Computer_Vision_and_Robotics","abstract":"This chapter describes the vision-based control strategies for pick-and-place robotic application. The software application of these strategies is accomplished by using MATLAB/SIMULINK of MathWorks -Company. The vision algorithms are used to identify the interest-objects models and send their position and orientation data to the data acquisition system then to the microcontroller which solves the inverse kinematics and orders the robot to pick these objects to place them in a target goal.","authors":["Ahmed E Solyman"],"meta":["February 2019","Project: 5-DOF Robotic Arm Manipulator - MSc"],"references":[]}
