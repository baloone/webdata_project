{"id":"304808517_Resource_Utilization_in_Cloud_Computing_as_an_Optimization_Problem","abstract":"In this paper, an algorithm for resource utilization problem in cloud computing based on greedy method is presented. A privately-owned cloud that provides services to a huge number of users is assumed. For a given resource, hundreds or thousands of requests accumulate over time to use that resource by different users worldwide via the Internet. A prior knowledge of the requests to use that resource is also assumed. The main concern is to find the best utilization schedule for a given resource in terms of profit obtained by utilizing that resource, and the number of time slices during which the resource will be utilized. The problem is proved to be an NP-Complete problem. A greedy algorithm is proposed and analyzed in terms of its runtime complexity. The proposed solution is based on a combination of the 0/1 Knapsack problem and the activity-selection problem. The algorithm is implemented using Java. Results show good performance with a runtime complexity O((F-S)nLogn).","authors":["Ala'a Al-Shaikh","Hebatallah Khattab","Ahmad Abdel-Aziz Sharieh","Azzam Sleit"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 7(6)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070643"],"references":["260305189_Multi-Tenancy_in_Cloud_Computing","221399987_Multi-tenant_SOA_Middleware_for_Cloud_Computing","258023685_The_NIST_Definition_of_Cloud_Computing_Draft_Recommendations_of_the_National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","228894571_Different_Approaches_to_Solve_the_01_Knapsack_Problem","35520515_Algorithms_for_Knapsack_Problems"]}
