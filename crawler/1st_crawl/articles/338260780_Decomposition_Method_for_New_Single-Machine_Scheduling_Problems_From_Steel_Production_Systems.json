{"id":"338260780_Decomposition_Method_for_New_Single-Machine_Scheduling_Problems_From_Steel_Production_Systems","abstract":"Production scheduling is a crucial task in modern steel plants. The scheduling of a wire rod and bar rolling process is challenging in many steel plants, which has a direct impact on their production efficiency and profit. This article studies a new single-machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup time, release time, and due time constraints originated from a wire rod and bar rolling process in steel plants. In this problem, jobs have been assigned to batches in advance. The objective is to schedule the batches and jobs on continuous time to minimize the number of late jobs. A mixed-integer program is created as a baseline model. A baseline method is used to solve this NP-hard problem by solving the baseline model. We further design a two-stage decomposition method after analyzing the characteristics of this problem. Both actual and simulated instances with varying sizes are solved by using the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the baseline method can only solve some small-scale cases, while the decomposition method can solve all small-scale cases and some medium-scale cases. Finally, we reveal the impacts of different instances on the performance of the proposed decomposition method.","authors":["Ziyan Zhao","Shixin Liu","Mengchu Zhou","Xiwang Guo"],"meta":["December
