{"id":"220546862_Evolution_of_artificial_intelligence","abstract":"The growth and development in the field of artificial intelligence are discussed. Darwin showed how complex and adaptive systems can arise naturally from a process selection acting on random variation. This is the way that a complex adaptive design can be created without an intelligent designer. Within the artificial intelligence community to produce adaptive complexity, so of the researchers deny the power of evolutionary processes to create machine intelligence. Most AI texts demonstrate a set of design problems that human designers are expected to solve. Few describe evolutionary perspectives on the development of natural or AI and most describe existing evolutionary methods. The problem solving performance of evolutionary algorithms has advanced significantly to the extent that human-competitive results have recently been achieved in several areas. The field has long acknowledged that intelligent behavior might best be achieved by agents that learn or redesign themselves.","authors":["Lee Spector"],"meta":["December 2006Artificial Intelligence 170(18):1251-1253","DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2006.10.009","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226096470_An_Evolved_Antenna_for_Deployment_on_Nasa's_Space_Technology_5_Mission","222646590_Backward-chaining_evolutionary_algorithms","220693385_Introduction_to_Artificial_Intelligence","220286100_Automatic_Quantum_Computer_Programming_A_Genetic_Programming_Approach","267187555_Automatic_quantum_computer_programming_A_genetic_programming_approach_2nd_printing","267090001_Intelligent_Machinery","262217672_Artificial_intelligence_An_introduction","238181396_An_Introduction_to_Artificial_Intelligence","236025154_Artificial_Intelligence_A_New_Synthesis","235890207_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Prentice_Hall","234896536_Two-dimensional_photonic_crystals_designed_by_evolutionary_algorithms","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","220692480_Artificial_intelligence_-_theory_and_practice","200044349_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","31646597_Artificial_intelligence_PH_Winston","3347249_The_intelligent_machine","2493089_Automated_Discovery_of_Composite_SAT_Variable-Selection_Heuristics","2237217_Genetic_Programming_Produced_Competitive_Soccer_Softbot_Teams_for_RoboCup97"]}
