{"id":"327399549_Intelligent_Model_Conception_Proposal_for_Adaptive_Hypermedia_Systems","abstract":"The context of this article is to study and propose solutions for the major problems of adaptive hypermedia systems. In fact, the works and models proposed for these systems are made according to the tradition of studying first theories and rules, then modeling and designing a system that implements them. As a result, adaptive hypermedia systems designed reflect and support only the elements and information that were studied during the design phase. Also, these systems require a huge amount of data to power their architecture in order to start operating. This famous problem is called \"cold start\" and until now represents a challenge. So, in this paper, we will propose an intelligent and flexible model inspired by human nature and that proposes a promising solution to these problems concerning hypermedia adaptive systems.
