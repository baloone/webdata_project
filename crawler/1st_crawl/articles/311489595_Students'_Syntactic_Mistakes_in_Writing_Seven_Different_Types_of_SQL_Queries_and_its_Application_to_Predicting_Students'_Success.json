{"id":"311489595_Students'_Syntactic_Mistakes_in_Writing_Seven_Different_Types_of_SQL_Queries_and_its_Application_to_Predicting_Students'_Success","abstract":"The computing education community has studied extensively the errors of novice programmers. In contrast, little attention has been given to student's mistake in writing SQL statements. This paper represents the first large scale quantitative analysis of the student's syntactic mistakes in writing different types of SQL queries. Over 160 thousand snapshots of SQL queries were collected from over 2000 students across eight years. We describe the most common types of syntactic errors that students make. We also describe our development of an automatic classifier with an overall accuracy of 0.78 for predicting student performance in writing SQL queries.","authors":["Alireza Ahadi","Vahid Behbood","Arto Vihavainen","Julia Prior"],"meta":["February 2016","DOI:10.1145/2839509.2844640","Conference: the 47th ACM Technical Symposium"],"references":["311474855_An_open_integrated_exploratorium_for_database_courses","300481245_A_Quantitative_Study_of_the_Relative_Difficulty_for_Novices_of_Writing_Seven_Different_Types_of_SQL_Queries","282260627_Learning_SQL_Programming_with_Interactive_Tools_From_Integration_to_Personalization","269923437_Learning_SQL_Programming_with_Interactive_Tools","266657134_AsseSQL_an_online_browser-based_SQL_skills_assessment_tool","221900777_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","221537091_Learning_SQL_with_a_computerized_tutor","220808515_The_backwash_effect_on_SQL_skills_grading","220807401_An_open_integrated_exploratorium_for_database_courses","215990408_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","38319259_An_intelligent_SQL_tutor_on_the_web","32229458_An_intelligent_SQL_tutor_on_the_web","4105066_Semantic_errors_in_SQL_queries_A_quite_complete_list","2779742_Generating_Accurate_Rule_Sets_Without_Global_Optimization","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","256134867_Logical_errors_in_database_SQL_retrieval_queries","222432151_Semantic_errors_in_SQL_queries_A_quite_complete_list","222381693_Correcting_user_errors_in_SQL","220225097_Human_Factors_Comparison_of_a_Procedural_and_a_Nonprocedural_Query_Language","220107664_User_errors_in_database_query_composition","220070823_Use_of_Psychological_Experimentation_as_an_Aid_to_Development_of_a_Query_Language"]}
