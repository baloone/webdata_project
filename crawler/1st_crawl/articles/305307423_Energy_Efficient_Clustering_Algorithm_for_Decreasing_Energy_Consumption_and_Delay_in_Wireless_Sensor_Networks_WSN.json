{"id":"305307423_Energy_Efficient_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Decreasing_Energy_Consumption_and_Delay_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_WSN","abstract":"In recent years, there has been increasing research interest in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). WSN consist of small nodes with sensing, processing and wireless communications capabilities. Wireless Sensor network's key issue is developing energy-efficient clustering Protocol. Hierarchical clustering algorithms increased network life time. The primary point in these algorithms is the cluster head selection. Overall simulation performance shows energy consumption is better than the existing algorithm. And with that delay consumption is decreased.","authors":["Nirbhay Chaubey","Dharti H Patel"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.15682/IJIRCCE.2016","Project: Security in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment"],"references":["267307410_VGDRA_A_Virtual_Grid_based_Dynamic_Routes_Adjustment_Scheme_for_Mobile_Sink_based_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","46093673_Modified_Rumor_Routing_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3436000_Routing_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","306927596_A_Survey_on_Energy_Efficient_Secure_Routing_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","281448302_Reliable_SPIN_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","272381370_Energy_Efficient_Clustering_Scheme_for_Prolonging_the_Lifetime_of_Wireless_Sensor_Network_With_Isolated_Nodes","261299431_A_General_Self-Organized_Tree-Based_Energy-Balance_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network","224700774_Verification_of_The_Minimum_Cost_Forwarding_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","4352315_Speed_Aware_Modified_Span_for_Wireless_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks"]}
