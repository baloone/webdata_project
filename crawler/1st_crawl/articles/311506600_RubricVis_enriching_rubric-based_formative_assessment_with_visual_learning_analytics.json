{"id":"311506600_RubricVis_enriching_rubric-based_formative_assessment_with_visual_learning_analytics","abstract":"The implementation of the Bologna Process has implied, in many Spanish universities, the introduction of continuous evaluation processes, in which formative assessment has a great relevance. In such kinds of scenarios, rubrics provide many benefits that can remarkably be improved using Visual Learning Analytics techniques. This paper presents some of the visualization capabilities provided by RubricVis, a system that uses Visual Learning Analytics techniques to enhance rubric-based formative assessment. The objective of these visualizations is to enrich the feedback for both students and teachers in such evaluation environments. This feedback will help users to understand the learning and evaluation processes in order to improve them.","authors":["Mikel Villamañe","Mikel Larrañaga","Ainhoa Alvarez","Begoña Ferrero"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1145/3012430.3012541","Conference: the Fourth International Conference"],"references":["249037732_Rubric-Referenced_Self-Assessment_and_Self-Efficacy_for_Writing","247700990_Teaching_at_Its_Best_A_Research-Based_Resource_for_College_Instructors","234169756_The_Use_of_Scoring_Rubrics_for_Formative_Assessment_Purposes_Revisited_A_Review","233380810_Rubrics_and_self-assessment_scripts_effects_on_self-regulation_learning_and_self-efficacy_in_secondary_education","221413776_20000_Inspections_of_a_Domain-Independent_Open_Learner_Model_with_Individual_and_Comparison_Views","290510384_New_Opportunities_with_Open_Learner_Models_and_Visual_Learning_Analytics","290445080_Measuring_and_Visualizing_Learning_in_the_Information-Rich_Classroom","288583776_Enhancing_Learning_with_Visualization_Techniques","283127721_Dealing_with_common_problems_in_engineering_degrees'_Final_Year_Projects","278650406_Open_Learner_Models_as_Drivers_for_Metacognitive_Processes","273352192_Experiences_Incorporating_Lego_Mindstorms_Robots_in_the_Basic_Programming_Syllabus_Lessons_Learned","262363163_Usefulness_of_Information_Visualizations_Based_on_Educational_Data","254463038_Learning_analytics_Envisioning_a_research_discipline_and_a_domain_of_practice","252849495_Quantitative_analysis_of_the_rubric_as_an_assessment_tool_An_empirical_study_of_student_peer-group_rating","234672988_Learner-Centered_Assessment_on_College_Campuses_Sifting_the_Focus_from_Teaching_to_Learning","222672825_The_use_of_scoring_rubrics_Reliability_validity_and_educational_consequences"]}
