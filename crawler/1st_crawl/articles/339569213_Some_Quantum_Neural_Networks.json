{"id":"339569213_Some_Quantum_Neural_Networks","abstract":"We analyzed the classical aritificial neural networks (ANN) and quantum neural networks (QNN), in particular, Boltzmann machines, Hopfield machines, the rules of training quantum neural networks. Then we analyzed the case of implementing the XOR QNN. We proposed to use the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm and Groverâ€™s Search Algorithm in QNN. We looked at the problem of least square solutions of the linear regression and proposed to use the quantum Gauss-Jordan Elimination Code to solve the LSP equation. This lets us to make the network works outperform the classical approaches.","authors":["Do Ngoc Diep"],"meta":["April 2020International Journal of Theoretical Physics 59(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-020-04397-1","Project: The possible applications of quantum algorithms"],"references":["342963763_Machine_learning_phase_transitions_with_a_quantum_processor","335207108_Various_New_Forms_of_the_Bernstein-Vazirani_Algorithm_Beyond_Qubit_Systems","335201591_Various_New_Forms_of_the_Bernstein-Vazirani_Algorithm_Beyond_Qubit_Systems","295173380_Quantum_Gauss-Jordan_Elimination_and_Simulation_of_Accounting_Principles_on_Quantum_Computers","265554646_An_introduction_to_quantum_machine_learning","309186321_A_practical_guide_to_training_restricted_boltzmann_machinesJ","307525218_Prediction_by_linear_regression_on_a_quantum_computer","290464452_Quantum_Neural_Networks","2869168_Training_a_Quantum_Neural_Network"]}
