{"id":"318331669_Quantum_game_players_can_have_advantage_without_discord","abstract":"The last two decades have witnessed a rapid development of quantum information processing, a new paradigm which studies the power and limit of “quantum advantages” in various information processing tasks. The ultimate question to be answered is when quantum advantage exists and, if existing, how much it could be. In a broad class of scenarios, there are, implicitly or explicitly, two or more parties sharing a state, and the correlation among the different parts of the state is a key factor to the quantum efficiency under concern. This correlation is usually quantified by entanglement or discord, which are widely considered as important or even necessary resources for quantum advantage to exist. In this paper, we examine a problem of this nature in the realm of game theory, where two players have different objectives to maximize. We exhibit a natural zero-sum game, in which the payoffs depend only on the correlation of their shared state. We show that in a certain classical equilibrium, a situation in which no player can increase her payoff by any local classical operation, whoever switches to a quantum computer has a big advantage over its classical opponent. The equilibrium state is symmetric, thus fair to both players, and the state as a shared correlation has zero entanglement or discord, yet the quantum player can still have an advantage when playing with a classical player on this state.","authors":["Zhaohui Wei","Shengyu Zhang"],"meta":["July 2017Information and Computation 256","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2017.07.004"],"references":["260512729_Efficient_Protocols_for_Generating_Bipartite_Classical_Distributions_and_Quantum_States"]}
