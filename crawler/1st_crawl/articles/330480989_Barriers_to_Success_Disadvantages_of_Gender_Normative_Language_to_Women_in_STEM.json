{"id":"330480989_Barriers_to_Success_Disadvantages_of_Gender_Normative_Language_to_Women_in_STEM","abstract":"Cultural ideals of gender normativity creates stereotypes that lead to the identification of specific occupations as being male-oriented or female-oriented, further perpetuating institutional sexism. Research shows that stereotypical beliefs are pervasive and exist in all professions, including higher education. Women academics, especially in the STEM fields, are still present in low numbers and often have to sacrifice marriage and family for their careers due to the overarching masculine organizational structure that forms the basis of most higher education institutions. This chapter will discuss the history of women in academia, gender equity in higher education, and the consequences of gender normative language on women in academia.","authors":["Melissa M.
