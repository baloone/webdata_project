{"id":"276020146_Semi-Automatic_RoadPavement_Modeling_using_Mobile_Laser_Scanning","abstract":"Scene analysis, in urban environments, deals with street modeling and understanding. A street mainly consists of roadways, pavements\n(i.e., walking areas), facades, still and moving obstacles. In this paper, we investigate the surface modeling of roadways and pavements\nusing LIDAR data acquired by a mobile laser scanning (MLS) system. First, road border detection is considered. A system recognizing\ncurbs and curb ramps while reconstructing the missing information in case of occlusion is presented. A user interface scheme is also\ndescribed, providing an effective tool for semi-automatic processing of large amount of data. Then, based upon road edge information,\na process that reconstructs surfaces of roads and pavements has been developed, providing a centimetric precision while reconstructing\nmissing information. This system hence provides an important knowledge of the street, that may open perspectives in various domains\nsuch as path planning or road maintenance.","authors":["Alexandre Hervieu","Bahman Soheilian"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.5194/isprsannals-II-3-W3-31-2013"],"references":["266464502_Filtering_of_Artifacts_and_Pavement_Segmentation_from_Mobile_LiDAR_Data","257346561_Semi-automated_extraction_and_delineation_of_3D_roads_of_street_scene_from_mobile_laser_scanning_point_clouds","236846208_Stereopolis_II_A_multi-purpose_and_multi-sensor_3D_mobile_mapping_system_for_street_visualisation_and_3D_metrology","236592835_Road_Side_Detection_and_Reconstruction_Using_LIDAR_Sensor","235922792_Curb_Detection_for_a_Pedestrian_Robot_in_Urban_Environments","230867300_Joint_2D-3D_Temporally_Consistent_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Street_Scenes","230690784_In-lane_Localization_in_Road_Networks_using_Curbs_Detected_in_Omnidirectional_Height_Images","224244810_A_temporal_filter_approach_for_detection_and_reconstruction_of_curbs_and_road_surfaces_based_on_Conditional_Random_Fields","257129074_Mapping_Curbstones_in_Airborne_and_Mobile_Laser_Scanning_Data","241637647_Enhanced_Road_Boundary_and_Obstacle_Detection_Using_a_Downward-Looking_LIDAR_Sensor"]}
