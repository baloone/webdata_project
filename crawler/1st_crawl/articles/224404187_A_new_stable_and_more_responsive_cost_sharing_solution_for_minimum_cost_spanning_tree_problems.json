{"id":"224404187_A_new_stable_and_more_responsive_cost_sharing_solution_for_minimum_cost_spanning_tree_problems","abstract":"Minimum cost spanning tree (mcst) problems try to connect agents efficiently to a source when agents are located at different points in space and the cost of using an edge is fixed. We introduce a new cost sharing solution that always selects a point in the core and that is more responsive to changes than the well-studied folk solution. The paper shows a sufficient condition for the concavity of the stand-alone cost game. Modifying the game to make sure the condition is satisfied and then taking the Shapley value gives the new solution.","authors":["Christian Trudeau"],"meta":["May 2012Games and Economic Behavior 75(1):402-412","DOI:10.1016/j.geb.2011.09.002"],"references":["220442662_Sharing_the_Cost_of_a_Capacity_Network","23778652_On_Some_Properties_of_Cost_Allocation_Rules_in_Minimum_Cost_Spanning_Tree_Problems","4865210_On_the_Irreducible_Core_and_the_Equal_Remaining_Obligations_Rule_of_Minimum_Cost_Spanning_Extension_Problems","313758819_Super-modularity_Applications_to_convex_games_and_to_the_greedy_algorithm_for_lp","266046739_Linking_the_Kar_and_Folk_Solutions_Through_a_Problem_Separation_Property","257797435_Computation_of_the_Shapley_value_of_minimum_cost_spanning_tree_games_P-hardness_and_polynomial_cases","243007551_Cores_of_exact_games_I1","229724442_On_cost_allocation_for_a_spanning_tree_A_game_theoretic_approach","228108285_On_Balanced_Sets_and_Cores","228108082_The_Relationship_Between_Convex_Games_and_Minimum_Cost_Spanning_Tree_Games_A_Case_for_Permutationally_Convex_Games","226282465_Cores_of_convex_games","225260822_On_the_Convexity_of_Communication_Games","223725606_Obligation_rules_for_minimum_cost_spanning_tree_situations_and_their_monotonicity_properties","222815610_A_fair_rule_in_minimum_cost_spanning_tree_problems","222760776_Axiomatization_of_the_Shapley_Value_on_Minimum_Cost_Spanning_Tree_Games","222733273_Supermodularity_Applications_to_convex_games_and_to_the_greedy_algorithm_for_LP","222553074_Additivity_in_minimum_cost_spanning_tree_problems","222302480_Cost_monotonicity_consistency_and_minimum_cost_spanning_tree_games","47463416_The_P-Value_for_Cost_Sharing_in_Minimum_Cost_Spanning_Tree_Situations","46507462_Sharing_a_minimal_cost_spanning_tree_Beyond_the_Folk_solution","5158842_The_P-value_for_cost_sharing_in_minimum","4784233_The_Bird_Core_for_Minimum_Cost_Spanning_Tree_Problems_Revisited_Monotonicity_and_Additivity_Aspects","4759127_Minimum_cost_spanning_tree_games_and_population_monotonic_allocation_schemes"]}
