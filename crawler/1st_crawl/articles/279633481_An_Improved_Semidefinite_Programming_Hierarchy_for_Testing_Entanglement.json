{"id":"279633481_An_Improved_Semidefinite_Programming_Hierarchy_for_Testing_Entanglement","abstract":"We present a stronger version of the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS)\nhierarchy of approximations for the set of separable states. Unlike DPS, our\nhierarchy converges exactly at a finite number of rounds for any fixed input\ndimension. This yields an algorithm for separability testing which is singly\nexponential in dimension and polylogarithmic in accuracy. Our analysis makes\nuse of tools from algebraic geometry, but our algorithm is elementary and\ndiffers from DPS only by one simple additional collection of constraints.","authors":["Aram W.
