{"id":"285793548_Studies_on_Cardiopulmonary_Function_of_Swimming_Athletes_2","abstract":"To measure the cardiopulmonary function of thirty-one swimming athletes, vital capacity, maximum breathing capacity and step up test were taken and compared with normal controls.\n1) Vital capacity and maximum breathing capacity of the swimming athletes were remarkably large when compared with young men who were non-athletes. Their vital capacity was larger than that of other athletes but their maximum breathing capacity shows almost the same increase.\n2) In lung volume of the swimming athletes, total volume and vital capacity were large and ratio of residual volume was low. The increase of vital capacity was caused by the increase of inspiratory reserve volume. This is considered as the adaptation of respiratory phase to swimming.\n3) In step up test, cardiopulmonary function of the swimming athletes showed very suitable change for exercise. This is considered to be the result of the increase of adaptive power of cardiopulmonary function to exercise.","authors":["Noboru OGAWA"],"meta":["January 1958","DOI:10.14789/pjmj.4.352"],"references":[]}
