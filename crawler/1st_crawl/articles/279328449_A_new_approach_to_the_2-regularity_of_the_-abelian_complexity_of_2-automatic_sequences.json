{"id":"279328449_A_new_approach_to_the_2-regularity_of_the_-abelian_complexity_of_2-automatic_sequences","abstract":"We prove that a sequence satisfying a certain symmetry property is 2-regular in the sense of Allouche and Shallit, i.e., the Z-module generated by its 2-kernel is finitely generated. We apply this theorem to develop a general approach for studying the f-abelian complexity of 2-automatic sequences. In particular, we prove that the period-doubling word and the Thue-Morse word have 2-abelian complexity sequences that are 2-regular. Along the way, we also prove that the 2-block codings of these two words have 1-abelian complexity sequences that are 2-regular.","authors":["Aline Parreau","Michel Rigo","Eric Rowland","Elise Vandomme"],"meta":["February 2015The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 22(1)","DOI:10.37236/4478"],"references":["267469422_Abelian_complexity_of_fixed_point_of_morphism_001210221","319395335_Fibonacci_Numbers_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","267976282_Noncommutative_Rational_Series_with_Applications","261673103_On_the_2-Abelian_Complexity_of_the_Thue-Morse_Word","235633963_Variations_of_the_Morse-Hedlund_Theorem_for_k-Abelian_Equivalence","234689314_On_a_generalization_of_Abelian_equivalence_and_complexity_of_infinitewords","230672317_The_abelian_complexity_of_the_paperfolding_word","226578348_The_ring_of_k-regular_sequences","225865226_Uniform_Tag_Seqences","225224998_On_uniform_DOL_words"]}
