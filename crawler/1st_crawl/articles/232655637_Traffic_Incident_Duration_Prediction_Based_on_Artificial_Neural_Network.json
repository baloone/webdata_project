{"id":"232655637_Traffic_Incident_Duration_Prediction_Based_on_Artificial_Neural_Network","abstract":"The prediction of traffic incident duration is an important foundation of advanced incident management system and driver information system. In this paper, actual traffic incident data was used to study the prediction problem of traffic incident duration by the method of neural network. 660 sets of actual traffic incident data from a freeway management center were used to train a neural network model, and 170 sets of incident data in the same data collection, which are different from training data, were used to test the prediction effect of the model. The test result shows that the correlation of the prediction values and the actual values is 0.8535, which indicates that the prediction result of the neural network model can basically represent actual incident duration.","authors":["Liping Guan","Weiming Liu","Xiangyuan Yin","Luping Zhang"],"meta":["May 2010","DOI:10.1109/ICICTA.2010.418"],"references":["319458312_Application_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_in_Flotation_Processes","291133225_Prediction_of_freeway_incident_duration_based_on_decision_tree","243688311_Incident_Management_in_Intelligent_Transportation_Systems","238180487_Estimating_Magnitude_and_Duration_of_Incident_Delays","48189159_Development_of_prediction_models_for_freeway_incident_durations_using_data_mining_techniques","38065177_Development_of_an_accident_duration_prediction_model_on_the_Korean_Freeway_Systems","23526365_An_exploratory_hazard-based_analysis_of_highway_incident_duration","7345422_Estimation_of_incident_clearance_times_using_Bayesian_Networks_approach","6502531_Sequential_forecast_of_incident_duration_using_Artificial_Neural_Network_models"]}
