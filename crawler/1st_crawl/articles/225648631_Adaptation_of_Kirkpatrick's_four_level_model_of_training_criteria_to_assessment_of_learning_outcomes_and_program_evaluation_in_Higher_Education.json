It also provides\nimportant information to external stakeholders, such as prospective students, parents, governmental and local regulatory entities,\nprofessional and regional accrediting organizations, and representatives of the workforce. However, selecting appropriate\nindicators of educational effectiveness of programs and institutions is a difficult task, especially when criteria of effectiveness\nare not well defined. This article proposes a comprehensive and systematic approach to aligning criteria for educational effectiveness\nwith specific indicators of achievement of these criteria by adapting a popular organizational training evaluation framework,\nthe Kirkpatrickâ€™s four level model of training criteria (Kirkpatrick 1959; 1976; 1996), to assessment in Higher Education. The four level model consists of reaction, learning, behavior and results criteria. Adaptation of this model to Higher Education helps to clarify the criteria and create plans for assessment of educational\noutcomes in which specific instruments and indicators are linked to corresponding criteria. This provides a rich context for\nunderstanding the role of various indicators in the overall mosaic of assessment. It also provides Institutions of Higher\nEducation rich and multilevel feedback regarding the effectiveness of their effort to serve their multiple stakeholders. The\nimportance of such feedback is contextualized both in the reality of stakeholder pressures and in theoretical understanding\nof colleges and universities as open systems according to the systems theory (Katz and Kahn 1966). Although the focus of this article is on Higher Education, core principles and ideas will be applicable to different types\nand levels of educational programs.\n\nKeywordsAssessment-Evaluation-Program evaluation-Higher Education-Education-Criteria","authors":["Ludmila Praslova"],"meta":["August 2010Educational Assessment Evaluation and Accountability 22(3):215-225","DOI:10.1007/s11092-010-9098-7"],"references":["44833082_Applying_the_Science_of_Learning_to_the_University_and_Beyond_Teaching_for_Long-Term_Retention_and_Transfer","41529875_Good_Education_in_an_Age_of_Measurement_On_the_Need_to_Reconnect_with_the_Question_of_Purpose_in_Education","12181672_The_Science_of_Training_A_Decade_of_Progress","312891815_Techniques_for_Evaluating_Training_Programs_Reaction","286012439_The_Social_Psychology_of_Organizations","279951122_Teaching_Effectiveness_The_relationship_between_reaction_and_learning_evaluation_criteria","250174033_The_PISA_International_Study_and_Problems_of_the_Development_of_Higher_Education","247827809_Educating_Citizens_Preparing_America's_Undergraduates_for_Lives_of_Moral_and_Civic_Responsibility_review","242357954_Techniques_for_Evaluating_Training_Programs","239603753_Accreditation_and_Student_Learning_Outcomes_A_Pr_oposed_Point_of_Departure","234664384_Assessing_General_Education_Programs","234585581_Applying_Systems_Theory_to_Systemic_Change_A_Generic_Model_for_Educational_Reform","233263534_The_relationship_between_trainees'_evaluation_of_teaching_and_trainee_performance_among_Norwegian_executive_students","232562659_Invited_Reaction_Reaction_to_Holton_Article","230211134_Assessing_outcomes_of_character-building_programs_Problems_and_prospects","229788533_Accreditation_and_institutional_research_The_traditional_role_and_new_dimensions","229492500_Citizenship_Development_and_the_American_College_Student","227821243_Higher_education_and_workforce_development_A_strategic_role_for_institutional_research","227736436_The_role_of_institutional_assessment_in_assessing_student_learning_outcomes","227611464_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Relations_Among_Training_Criteria","225797448_What_Can_Institutional_Research_do_to_Help_Colleges_Meet_the_Workforce_Needs_of_States_and_Nations","44827996_The_Social_Psychology_of_Organizing","10773180_Effectiveness_of_Training_in_Organizations_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Design_and_Evaluation_Features"]}
