{"id":"228280089_Wisdom_of_Crowds_The_Value_of_Stock_Opinions_Transmitted_Through_Social_Media","abstract":"Social media has become a popular venue for individuals to share the results of their own analysis on financial securities.\nThis paper investigates the extent to which investor opinions transmitted through social media predict future stock returns\nand earnings surprises. We conduct textual analysis of articles published on one of the most popular social media platforms\nfor investors in the United States. We also consider the readers' perspective as inferred via commentaries written in response\nto these articles. We find that the views expressed in both articles and commentaries predict future stock returns and earnings\nsurprises.","authors":["Hailiang Chen","Prabuddha De","Yu (Jeffrey) Hu","Byoung-Hyoun  Hwang"],"meta":["December 2013Review of Financial Studies","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.1807265"],"references":["227465410_Journalists_and_the_Stock_Market","220535097_Online_Consumer_Review_Word-of-Mouth_as_a_New_Element_of_Marketing_Communication_Mix","220534598_Yahoo_for_Amazon_Sentiment_Extraction_from_Small_Talk_on_the_Web","220438020_Social_Network_Sites_Definition_History_and_Scholarship","46543559_Short-Sale_Constraints_Differences_of_Opinion_and_Overvaluation","5216992_Advertising_Breadth_of_Ownership_and_Liquidity","280906519_Beyond_the_Numbers_Measuring_the_Information_Content_of_Earnings_Press_Release_Language","280780628_How_Wise_Are_Crowds_Insights_from_Retail_Orders_and_Stock_Returns","280698692_Don't_Believe_the_Hype_Local_Media_Slant_Local_Advertising_and_Firm_Value","261973275_Selective_Publicity_and_Stock_Prices","240137741_News_or_Noise_Internet_Postings_and_Stock_Prices","240025267_Growth_Expectations_and_Stock_Returns_or_Don''t_Let_an_Earnings_Torpedo_Sink_Your_Portfolio","228150567_Word-of-Mouth_for_Movies_Its_Dynamics_and_Impact_on_Box_Office_Revenue","228140730_Individual_Investor_Trading_and_Stock_Returns","227762411_The_Causal_Impact_of_Media_in_Financial_Markets","227697511_In_Search_of_Attention","227660263_When_Is_a_Liability_NOT_a_Liability_Textual_Analysis_Dictionaries_and_10-Ks","227406156_The_Dartboard_Column_Second-Hand_Information_and_Price_Pressure","227374878_Individual_Investor_Trading_and_Return_Patterns_Around_Earnings_Announcements","227374865_Who_Drove_and_Burst_the_Tech_Bubble","227360756_Media_Coverage_and_the_Cross-Section_of_Stock_Returns","222685673_Annual_Report_Readability_Current_Earnings_and_Earnings_Persistence","222668464_Market_Efficiency_in_Real_Time","222560197_Investor_Psychology_in_Capital_Markets_Evidence_and_Policy_Implications","222554978_Buys_Holds_and_Sells_The_Distribution_of_Investment_Banks'_Stock_Ratings_and_the_Implications_for_the_Profitability_of_Analysts'_Recommendations","220019930_A_Heteroskedasticity-Consistent_Covariance_Matrix_and_A_Direct_Test_for_Heterskedasticity","209410115_Contagious_Speculation_and_a_Cure_for_Cancer_A_Nonevent_that_Made_Stock_Prices_Soar","46889019_Spam_Works_Evidence_from_Stock_Touts_and_Corresponding_Market_Activity","46543326_Brand_Perceptions_and_the_Market_for_Common_Stock","24116345_Thought_and_Behavior_Contagion_in_Capital_Markets","23771893_Conversations_among_Competitors","23754589_The_Effect_of_Word_of_Mouth_on_Sales_Online_Book_Reviews","5217125_Information_Diffusion_Effects_in_Individual_Investors'_Common_Stock_Purchases_Covet_Thy_Neighbors'_Investment_Choices","4992788_More_Than_Words_Quantifying_Language_to_Measure_Firms'_Fundamentals","4992763_Giving_Content_to_Investor_Sentiment_The_Role_of_Media_in_the_Stock_Market","4992674_Is_All_That_Talk_Just_Noise_The_Information_Content_of_Internet_Stock_Message_Boards","4951183_On_the_effects_of_stock_spam_e-mails","4913370_Correlated_Trading_and_Location","4897990_A_Simple_Positive_Semi-Definite_Heteroskedasticity_and_Autocorrelation_Consistent_Covariance_Matrix","4769334_Social_Interaction_and_Stock-Market_Participation","4769108_Excessive_Extrapolation_and_the_Allocation_of_401K_Accounts_to_Company_Stock","2445448_Bad_News_Travels_Slowly_Size_Analyst_Coverage_and_the_Profitability_of_Momentum_Strategies"]}
