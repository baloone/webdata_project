{"id":"340882429_Cognitive_Reading_and_Character_Recognition_in_Image_Processing_Techniques","abstract":"The trend of researches in cognitive reading has become so popular in programming area in the field of computer science from late 1990s when scientists and researchers show more interests in computational approaches are complex in nature to derive from a known algorithm of solution. For instance, in the research areas of biology, medicine and human management sciences there are various problems where we need cognitive reading to deliver a complex and in-exact solution when there is no polynomial time to arrive at an exact solution. This article explains some of the methods in cognitive reading in image processing for character recognition and briefly discusses the steps involved in the process of character recognition in image processing.","authors":["Magesh Kasthuri","Venkatasubramanian Sivaprasatham"],"meta":["April 2020SN Computer Science 1(3)","DOI:10.1007/s42979-020-00142-x","Project: Pattern recognition"],"references":["286479276_Segmentation_Methods_for_Hand_Written_Character_Recognition","276456901_Structural_Features_for_Recognition_of_Hand_Written_Kannada_Character_Based_on_SVM","313656857_Comparison_of_normalization_methods_for_character_recognition","309298111_A_novel_architecture_of_CNN_based_on_SVM_classifier_for_recognising_Arabic_handwritten_script","307966929_Experimental_Approach_for_Performance_Analysis_of_Thinning_Algorithms_for_Offline_Handwritten_Devnagri_Numerals","305235656_Offline_sanskirthandwritten_character_recognition_framework_based_on_multi_layerfeed_forward_network_with_intelligent_character_recognition","303746216_A_New_Design_Based-SVM_of_the_CNN_Classifier_Architecture_with_Dropout_for_Offline_Arabic_Handwritten_Recognition","301267258_A_Robust_System_for_Online_Handwritten_ChineseJapanese_Character_Recognition","282570817_Cluster-based_Query_Expansion_using_External_Collections_in_Medical_Information_Retrieval","278692927_Chinese_Image_Character_Recognition_Using_DNN_and_Machine_Simulated_Training_Samples","275097039_A_Technique_for_Offline_Handwritten_Character_Recognition","268514299_PCA_Based_Offline_Handwritten_GurmukhiCharacter_Recognition_System","261355141_Devnagari_handwritten_character_recognition_DHCR_for_ancient_documents_A_review","260127502_Handwritten_Character_Recognition_In_Malayalam_Scripts-_A_Review","261128937_Devnagari_character_recognition_using_self_organizing_maps"]}
