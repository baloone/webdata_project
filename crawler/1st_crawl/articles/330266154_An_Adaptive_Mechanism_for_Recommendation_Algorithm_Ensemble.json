{"id":"330266154_An_Adaptive_Mechanism_for_Recommendation_Algorithm_Ensemble","abstract":"Popular recommendation algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors and Slope One are appropriate for different situations. In this paper, we propose an approach which will be called adaptive mechanism for recommendation algorithm ensemble (AMRE). AMRE consists of three parts, including a set of agents, a reward-function and a roulette. First, each agent corresponds to a recommendation algorithm. It also contains a reward value to determine whether it should be retained or replaced. Second, a reward-function is designed to update the reward value according to recommendation results. Wrong recommendations bring punishments, while right ones bring rewards. Finally, a roulette chooses another agent when the reward value is below a given threshold. Experimental results on MovieLens datasets show that AMRE outperforms eleven well-known algorithms and two classical ensemble methods on Accuracy, Recall, and F1-measure.","authors":["Qi Huang","Yuan-Yuan Xu","Yong Chen","Heng-Ru Zhang"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2891561"],"references":["323537835_Efficient_collaborative_filtering_recommendations_with_multi-channel_feature_vectors","319171240_Integrating_Triangle_and_Jaccard_similarities_for_recommendation","301306996_Fast_Recommendations_With_the_M-Distance","327372004_Ensemble_selector_for_attribute_reduction","323201657_Structural_diversity_for_decision_tree_ensemble_learning","303634926_Cost-sensitive_feature_selection_based_on_adaptive_neighborhood_granularity_with_multi-level_confidence","298606994_Ensemble_methods_in_machine_learning","291172183_An_adaptive_learning_parameters_algorithm_in_three-way_decision-theoretic_rough_set_model","290855401_Improving_Simple_Collaborative_Filtering_Models_Using_Ensemble_Methods","288906520_Random_forests","282539393_Test-cost-sensitive_attribute_reduction_on_heterogeneous_data_for_adaptive_neighborhood_model","265254799_Aggregated_Recommendation_through_Random_Forests","249621256_Euclidean_Distance_as_a_Similarity_Metric_for_Principal_Component_Analysis","275256345_A_new_similarity_measure_using_Bhattacharyya_coefficient_for_collaborative_filtering_in_sparse_data","260711603_Drift_Compensation_for_Electronic_Nose_by_Semi-Supervised_Domain_Adaption"]}
