{"id":"11283765_Disease_anxiety_in_medical_students_and_law_students","abstract":"Medical students and other people with knowledge about health and disease are often thought to have more anxiety about their health than others.\n80 medical students and 100 law students were asked to fill in a questionnaire designed to identify higher disease anxiety (Whiteley Index). A high total score on the Whiteley Index indicates high disease anxiety. 62 medical students (78%) and 70 law students (70%) returned the questionnaire in an anonymous form.\nMedical students had lower total score compared with law students (p < 0.01). One medical student and six law students had a total score susceptible of hypochondriasis. Male students had a non-significantly higher mean total score than female students. Those with depressive mood (n = 5), had higher total score than the others (p < 0.01.) Those who had experienced disease in their family (n = 83) tended to have lower total score.\nMedical students have less disease anxiety than law students, contrary to what is often believed.","authors":["Ann Elisabeth Ellingsen","Ingvard Wilhelmsen"],"meta":["March 2002Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening 122(8):785-7","SourcePubMed"],"references":["277706837_Hypochondriacal_Fears_and_Beliefs_in_Medical_and_Law_Students","18784588_Medical_Students'_Disease_Hypochondriasis_in_Medical_Education","16495610_Underdiagnosis_of_hypochondriasis_in_family_practice","13640555_Health_anxiety_in_medical_students","9378663_Nosophobia_and_Hypochondriases_in_Medical_Students"]}
