{"id":"261289463_The_UK-DALE_dataset_domestic_appliance-level_electricity_demand_and_whole-house_demand_from_five_UK_homes","abstract":"Many countries are rolling out smart electricity meters. These measure a home's total power demand. However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal.\nTo conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the `ground truth' demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE: an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any energy dataset at this sample rate. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.","authors":["Jack Kelly","William Knottenbelt"],"meta":["March 2015Scientific Data 2(1)","DOI:10.1038/sdata.2015.7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266888035_Smart_An_Open_Data_Set_and_Tools_for_Enabling_Research_in_Sustainable_Homes","266565268_SustData_A_public_dataset_for_ICT4S_electric_energy_research","266565253_SustData_A_Public_Dataset_for_ICT4S_Electric_Energy_Research","265169205_A_comparison_of_non-intrusive_load_monitoring_methods_for_commercial_and_residential_buildings","262302322_GREEND_An_energy_consumption_dataset_of_households_in_Italy_and_Austria","312749803_BLUED_A_fully_labeled_public_dataset_for_event-based_non-intrusive_load_monitoring_research","284689750_Blued_A_fully_labeled_public_dataset_for_event-based_non-intrusive_load_monitoring_research","271504213_The_ECO_Data_Set_and_the_Performance_of_Non-Intrusive_Load_Monitoring_Algorithms","266597071_REDD_A_Public_Data_Set_for_Energy_Disaggregation_Research","265990682_Occupancy_and_behavioral_affects_on_residential_energy_use","261673114_NILMTK_An_open_source_toolkit_for_non-intrusive_load_monitoring","261066138_Metadata_for_Energy_Disaggregation","257527880_It's_Different_Insights_into_home_energy_consumption_in_India","257126344_Is_disaggregation_the_holy_grail_of_energy_efficiency_The_case_of_electricity","256597122_Psychological_framework_for_energy_conservation_in_buildings_Strategies_outcomes_directions"]}
