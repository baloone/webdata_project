{"id":"317259067_Fine-tuning_Spectrum_Based_Fault_Localisation_with_Sequence_Mining","abstract":"Spectrum based fault localisation techniques merely use the coverage of the program elements to localise the fault. These techniques ignore the dependency relationships between the elements and, hence, come at the cost of their limited diagnostic accuracy. In this paper we propose a variant of spectrum based fault localisation, which leverages sequences of method calls by means of sequence mining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the variant (we refer to it as sequenced spectrum analysis) by putting it in comparison to the state of the art with a case study on two open source java projects.","authors":["Gulsher Laghari","Alessandro Murgia","Serge Demeyer"],"meta":["December 2016","Conference: The 15th BElgian-NEtherlands software eVOLution seminar (BENEVOL 2016)At: Utrecht, the Netherlands"],"references":["306394778_Fine-Tuning_Spectrum_Based_Fault_Localisation_with_Frequent_Method_Item_Sets","266659285_Defects4J_a_database_of_existing_faults_to_enable_controlled_testing_studies_for_Java_programs","259542841_MARBLES_Mining_association_rules_buried_in_long_event_sequences","220375826_A_practical_evaluation_of_spectrum-based_fault_localization"]}
