{"id":"349118480_Optimising_Hardware_Accelerated_Neural_Networks_with_Quantisation_and_a_Knowledge_Distillation_Evolutionary_Algorithm","abstract":"This paper compares the latency, accuracy, training time and hardware costs of neural networks compressed with our new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called NEMOKD, and with quantisation. We evaluate NEMOKD on Intel's Movidius Myriad X VPU processor, and quantisation on Xilinx's programmable Z7020 FPGA hardware. Evolving models with NEMOKD increases inference accuracy by up to 82% at the cost of 38% increased latency, with throughput performance of 100â€“590 image frames-per-second (FPS). Quantisation identifies a sweet spot of 3 bit precision in the trade-off between latency, hardware requirements, training time and accuracy. Parallelising FPGA implementations of 2 and 3 bit quantised neural networks increases throughput from 6k FPS to 373k FPS, a 62x speedup.","authors":["Robert Stewart","Andrew Nowlan","Pascal Bacchus","Quentin Ducasse"],"meta":["February 2021Electronics 10(4)","DOI:10.3390/electronics10040396"],"references":["344006532_Layer-specific_Optimization_for_Mixed_Data_Flow_with_Mixed_Precision_in_FPGA_Design_for_CNN-based_Object_Detectors","336362646_Performance_Aware_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Channel_Pruning_for_Embedded_GPUs","329747614_CondenseNet_An_Efficient_DenseNet_Using_Learned_Group_Convolutions","348368184_Towards_Robust_Direct_Perception_Networks_for_Automated_Driving","347184638_Neural_Networks_Secure_by_Construction_An_Exploration_of_Refinement_Types","347019996_Relative_Robustness_of_Quantized_Neural_Networks_Against_Adversarial_Attacks","339021935_Automatic_Generation_of_Multi-Precision_Multi-Arithmetic_CNN_Accelerators_for_FPGAs","333527125_Deep_Neural_Network_Approximation_for_Custom_Hardware_Where_We've_Been_Where_We're_Going","331295573_REQ-YOLO_A_Resource-Aware_Efficient_Quantization_Framework_for_Object_Detection_on_FPGAs","329733296_FINN-_R_An_End-to-End_Deep-Learning_Framework_for_Fast_Exploration_of_Quantized_Neural_Networks"]}
