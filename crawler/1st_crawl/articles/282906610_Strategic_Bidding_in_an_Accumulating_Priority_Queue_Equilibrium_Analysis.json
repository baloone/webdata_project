{"id":"282906610_Strategic_Bidding_in_an_Accumulating_Priority_Queue_Equilibrium_Analysis","abstract":"We study the strategic purchasing of priorities in a time-dependent\naccumulating priority $M/G/1$ queue. We formulate a non-cooperative game in\nwhich customers purchase priority coefficients with the goal of reducing\n(possibly heterogeneous) waiting costs in exchange. The priority of each\ncustomer in the queue is a linear function of the individual waiting time, with\nthe purchased coefficient being the slope. The unique pure Nash equilibrium is\nsolved explicitly for the case with homogeneous customers. A general\ncharacterisation of the pure Nash equilibrium is provided for the heterogeneous\ncase. It is shown that both avoid the crowd and follow the crowd behaviours are\nprevalent, within class types and between them. We further present a pricing\nmechanism that ensures the order of the accumulating priority rates in\nequilibrium follows a $C\\mu$ type rule and improves overall efficiency.","authors":["Moshe Haviv","Liron Ravner"],"meta":["September 2016Annals of Operations Research 244(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10479-016-2141-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259635699_Waiting_time_distributions_in_the_accumulating_priority_queue","279335446_International_Series_in_Operations_Research_Management_Science","268022551_Analysis_of_the_Earliest_Due_Date_Scheduling_Rule_in_Queueing_Systems","267092812_Existence_and_Uniqueness_of_Equilibrium_Points_for_Concave_N-Person_Games","265894791_Probability_Theory_and_Examples","259995805_A_multi-class_multi-server_accumulating_priority_queue_with_application_to_health_care","248108265_To_Queue_or_not_to_Queue","243766133_Equilibrium_Points_in_Nonzero-Sum_n_-Person_Submodular_Games","243631605_A_Dynamic_Priority_Queue_with_General_Concave_Priority_Functions","242931844_A_Mixed_Delay_Dependent_Queue_Discipline","242930910_Time_Dependent_Priority_Queues","242630197_Optimal_Incentive-Compatible_Priority_Pricing_for_the_MM1_Queue","231829259_Equilibrium_Strategies_for_Processor_Sharing_and_Random_Queues_with_Relative_Priorities","230596013_Queuing_Systems_Volume_II_-_Computer_Applications","229801987_A_Delay_Dependent_Queue_Discipline"]}
