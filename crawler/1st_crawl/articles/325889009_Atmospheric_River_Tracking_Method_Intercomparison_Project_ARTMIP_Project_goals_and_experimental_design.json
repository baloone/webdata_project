{"id":"325889009_Atmospheric_River_Tracking_Method_Intercomparison_Project_ARTMIP_Project_goals_and_experimental_design","abstract":"The Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project\n(ARTMIP) is an international collaborative effort to understand and quantify\nthe uncertainties in atmospheric river (AR) science based on detection\nalgorithm alone. Currently, there are many AR identification and tracking\nalgorithms in the literature with a wide range of techniques and conclusions.\nARTMIP strives to provide the community with information on different\nmethodologies and provide guidance on the most appropriate algorithm for a\ngiven science question or region of interest. All ARTMIP participants will\nimplement their detection algorithms on a specified common dataset for a\ndefined period of time. The project is divided into two phases: Tier 1 will\nutilize the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications,\nversion 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis from January 1980 to June 2017 and will be\nused as a baseline for all subsequent comparisons. Participation in Tier 1 is\nrequired. Tier 2 will be optional and include sensitivity studies designed\naround specific science questions, such as reanalysis uncertainty and climate\nchange. High-resolution reanalysis and/or model output will be used wherever\npossible. Proposed metrics include AR frequency, duration, intensity, and\nprecipitation attributable to ARs. Here, we present the ARTMIP experimental\ndesign, timeline, project requirements, and a brief description of the\nvariety of methodologies in the current literature. We also present results\nfrom our 1-month proof-of-concept trial run designed to illustrate the\nutility and feasibility of the ARTMIP project.","authors":["Christine A. Shields","Jonathan J.
