{"id":"271659851_Design_and_Implementation_to_Authentication_over_a_GSM_System_Using_Certificate-Less_Public_Key_Cryptography_CL-PKC","abstract":"Recent years, the mobile technology has experienced a great increment in the number of its users. The GSM's architecture provides different security features like authentication, data/signaling confidentiality and secrecy of user yet the channel is susceptible to replay and interleaved. It always remains relevant as it is important in all types of application. Global system for mobile (GSM) communications has become the most popular standard for digital cellular communication. The GSM security system depends on encryption, authentication algorithms and information from SIM card. In this research paper, we proposed the design and implementation of a new authentication scheme by using certificate-less public key cryptography (CL-PKC) over the GSM system was attempted to miss some system detail. This research paper, we also proposed the GSM system and its security and public key cryptography with a focus in the CL-PKC; the CL-PKC is a simple, useful and robust security scheme designed and implemented over GSM. Our approach is more efficient than other competing topologies. We solved the GSM problem in A3 algorithm such as eavesdropping and this problem solved by CL-PKC because of its robustness against this type of attack by providing mutual authentication make the system more secure.","authors":["Imran Memon","Mohammed Ramadan Mohammed","Rizwan Akhtar","Hina Memon"],"meta":["November 2014Wireless Personal Communications 79(1):661-686","DOI:10.1007/s11277-014-1879-8","Project: Mobile/Wireless Networks Security using Public-key Cryptosystems"],"references":["262249707_An_Experimental_Security_Analysis_of_Two_Satphone_Standards","233761561_An_ECC_based_Public_Key_Infrastructure_usable_for_Mobile_Applications","220334843_Self-Generated-Certificate_Public_Key_Cryptography_and_Certificateless_Signature_Encryption_Scheme_in_the_Standard_Model","2843631_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2560610_CPAR_Classification_Based_on_Predictive_Association_Rules","308351893_CPAR_Classification_based_on_predictive_association_rules","297684673_Certificateless_public_key_cryptography","289544854_A_provable_authenticated_certificateless_group_key_agreement_with_constant_rounds","285887091_Certificateless_Public_Key_Cryptography","266653904_Composite_trust-based_public_key_management_in_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","262395290_A_more_efficient_and_faster_pairing_computation_with_cryptographic_security","262348382_On_the_properties_of_public_key_encryption_from_group_signatures","262314749_POSTER_A_pairing-free_Certificateless_Hybrid_Sign-Cryption_scheme_for_Advanced_Metering_Infrastructures","262243766_Security_and_privacy_of_electric_vehicles_in_the_smart_grid_context_problem_and_solution","259326061_Public_Key_Infrastructure_for_UAE_A_Case_Study","254462348_Certificateless_strong_designated_verifier_multisignature_scheme_using_bilinear_pairings","254058047_Wu_C_A_provable_authenticated_certificateless_group_key_agreement_with_constant_rounds_Journal_of_Communications_and_Networks_14_104-110","254021914_Enhancement_of_GSM_Security_Using_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_Algorithm","230875884_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_Feedforward_Classification_Network_Outputs_with_Relationships_to_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition","224174268_Highly_Acyclic_Groups_Hypergraph_Covers_and_the_Guarded_Fragment","221406469_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221193544_Security_and_Trust_of_Public_Key_Cryptography_Options_for_HIP","221005667_A_man-in-the-middle_attack_on_UMTS","220617927_Simple_Linear-Time_Algorithms_to_Test_Chordality_of_Graphs_Test_Acyclicity_of_Hypergraphs_and_Selectively_Reduce_Acyclic_Hypergraphs"]}
