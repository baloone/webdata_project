{"id":"295866874_Comparative_analysis_of_shape_descriptors_for_3D_objects","abstract":"One of the basic characteristics of an object is its shape. Several research areas in mathematics and computer science have taken an interest in object representation in both 2D images and 3D models, where shape descriptors are a powerful mechanism enabling the processes of classification, retrieval and comparison for object matching. In this paper, we present a literature survey of this broad field, including a comparative analysis based on the above shape descriptor processes. In view of their significance, we identified the shape descriptors implemented using the concept of visual salience. This paper gives an overview of this topic.","authors":["Graciela Lara López","Adriana Peña Pérez Negrón","Angélica de Antonio","Jaime Ramirez"],"meta":["March 2017Multimedia Tools and Applications 76(5)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-016-3330-5"],"references":["314734171_A_multi-resolution_approach_to_heat_kernels_on_discrete_surfaces","279826281_Extended_Gaussian_Images","319770652_3D_shape_descriptor_based_on_3D_Fourier_transform","319770624_3D_shape_matching_with_3D_shape_contexts","319770556_3D_Zernike_descriptors_for_content_based_shape_retrieval","319770544_A_survey_of_content_based_3D_shape_retrieval_methods","308805399_A_3D_Shape_Descriptor_Based_on_Depth_Complexity_and_Thickness_Histograms","285713542_Ffts_for_the_2-sphere-Improvements_and_variations","281357097_Spectral_Tools_for_Unsupervised_Modeling_of_Articulated_Objects_from_Multiple-view_Videos","281252400_Visual_Shape_Descriptors","278634887_Density-Based_Shape_Descriptors_and_Similarity_Learning_for_3D_Object_Retrieval","274387466_A_Comprehensive_Performance_Evaluation_of_3D_Local_Feature_Descriptors","276019654_3D_object_retrieval_based_on_PSO-K-modes_method","274956417_Spectral_Graph_Theory_CBMS_Regional_Conference_Series_in_Mathematics","273396648_A_Fine-Grained_Image_Categorization_System_by_Cellet-Encoded_Spatial_Pyramid_Modeling"]}
