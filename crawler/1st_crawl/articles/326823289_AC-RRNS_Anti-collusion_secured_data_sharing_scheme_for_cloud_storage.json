{"id":"326823289_AC-RRNS_Anti-collusion_secured_data_sharing_scheme_for_cloud_storage","abstract":"Cloud security issues are important factors for data storage and processing. Apart from the existing security and reliability problems of traditional distributed computing, there are new security and reliability problems. They include attacks on a virtual machine, attacks on the synchronization keys, and so on. According to the assessment of international experts in the field of cloud security, there are risks of cloud collusion under uncertain conditions. To mitigate this type of uncertainty and reduce harms it can cause, we propose AC-RRNS algorithm based on modified threshold Asmuth-Bloom and Mignotte secret sharing schemes. We prove that the algorithm satisfies the formal definition of computational security. If the adversary coalition knows the secret shares, but does not know the secret key, the probability to obtain the secret is less than 1/(2^(l⋅(k-1) ) (2^(l-k)-1)). The probability is less than 1/2^((l-1) ) with unknown secret shares and known secret key, and 1/2^(l⋅k) with unknown secret key. Its complexity is equal to brute-force method. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures security under several types of attacks. We propose approaches for selection of parameters for AC-RRNS secret sharing scheme to optimize the system behavior and data redundancy of encryption.","authors":["Andrei Tchernykh","Mikhail Babenko","Nikolay Chervyakovb","Vanessa Miranda-Lópeza"],"meta":["August 2018International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 102","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2018.07.010","Project: Multi-objective optimization of a multi-cloud data storage system with a secrets sharing scheme based on RRNS"],"references":["326257389_Configurable_cost-quality_optimization_of_cloud-based_VoIP","324280086_Towards_an_understanding_of_cloud_services_under_uncertainty_A_possibilistic_approach","322102215_Experimental_Analysis_of_Secret_Sharing_Schemes_for_Cloud_Storage_Based_on_RNS","320093601_Towards_Mitigating_Uncertainty_of_Data_Security_Breaches_and_Collusion_in_Cloud_Computing","312203030_Towards_a_Cloud_Computing_Paradigm_for_Big_Data_Analysis_in_Smart_Cities","326278996_A_Residue-based_approach_for_Resource_Provisioning_by_Horizontal_Scaling_across_Heterogeneous_Clouds","320388260_AR-RRNS_Configurable_reliable_distributed_data_storage_systems_for_Internet_of_Things_to_ensure_security","313390799_SHA-3_standard_Permutation-based_hash_and_extendable-output_functions","310741034_Towards_Understanding_Uncertainty_in_Cloud_Computing_with_risks_of_Confidentiality_Integrity_and_Availability","310441520_Design_of_Reverse_Converters_for_General_RNS_Moduli_Sets_2k2n-12n12n1-1_and_2k2n-12n12n-1-1_n_even"]}
