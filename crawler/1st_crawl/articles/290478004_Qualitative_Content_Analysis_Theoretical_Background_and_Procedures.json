{"id":"290478004_Qualitative_Content_Analysis_Theoretical_Background_and_Procedures","abstract":"Qualitative Content Analysis designates a bundle of text analysis procedures integrating qualitative and quantitative steps of analysis, which makes it an approach of mixed methods. This contribution defines it with a background of quantitative content analysis and compares it with other social science text analysis approaches (e.g. Grounded Theory). The basic theoretical and methodological assumptions are elaborated: reference to a communication model, rule orientation of analysis, theoretical background of those content analytical rules, categories in the center of the procedure, necessity of pilot testing of categories and rules, necessity of intra- and inter-coder reliability checks. Then the two main procedures, inductive category formation and deductive category assignment, are described by step models. Finally the procedures are compared with similar techniques (e.g. codebook analysis) and strengths and weaknesses are discussed.","authors":["Philipp Mayring"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-94-017-9181-6_13","In book: Approaches to Qualitative Research in Mathematics Education (pp.365-380)"],"references":["288859135_Qualitative_Media_Analysis","266859800_Qualitative_content_analysis_-_theoretical_foundation_basic_procedures_and_software_solution","254324422_Theme-Analysis_Procedures_and_Application_for_Psychotherapy_Research","215470778_The_General_Inquirer_A_Computer_Approach_to_Content_Analysis","349787821_The_Measurement_of_Psychological_States_Through_the_Content_Analysis_of_Verbal_Behavior","347561982_Mixed_Methodology_in_Psychological_Research","329648042_The_Big_Book_of_Concepts","319544758_The_Content_Analysis_Guidebook","317953655_Designing_and_conducting_mixed_methods_research","313390246_Basics_of_qualitative_research_Grounded_theory_procedures_and_techniques","312981604_Qualitative_Inhaltsanalyse","300090624_Assessment_of_Psychological_States_Through_Content_Analysis_of_Verbal_Communications","291046065_A_qualitative_oriented_approach_to_learning_emotions_at_school","288258282_Content_analysis","281093418_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Approaches_to_Content_Analysis","277815337_Designing_and_Conducting_Mixed_Method_Research","275677914_Basic_Content_Analysis","273987500_Content_Analysis_in_Communications_Research","270354083_Content_Analysis_of_Mass_Communications","264788396_Forschungsmethoden_in_Psychologie_und_Sozialwissenschaften","248068376_Thematic_text_analysis_new_agendas_for_analyzing_text_content","247817272_The_Content_Analysis_Guidebook","247790139_The_Big_Book_of_Concepts","247306606_Qualitative_Analysis_For_Social_Scientists","245581479_Basics_Of_Qualitative_Research_Grounded_Theory_Procedures_And_Techniques","240201177_Qualitative_Research_Methods_for_the_Social_Sciences_5","240200951_Qualitative_content_analysis-research_instrument_or_mode_of_interpretation","235700774_Qualitative_Inhaltsanalyse_Grundlagen_Und_Techniken","232571444_Trends_in_Content_Analysis","232427764_Paradigmatic_Controversies_Contradictions_and_Emerging_Confluences","226646240_Qualitative_Inhaltsanalyse","220017639_Content_Analysis_An_Introduction_To_Its_Methodology","43655459_The_Qualitative_Manifesto_A_Call_to_Arms"]}
