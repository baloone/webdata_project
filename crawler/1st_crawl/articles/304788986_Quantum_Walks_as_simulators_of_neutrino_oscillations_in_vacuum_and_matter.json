{"id":"304788986_Quantum_Walks_as_simulators_of_neutrino_oscillations_in_vacuum_and_matter","abstract":"We analyze the simulation of Dirac neutrino oscillations using quantum walks, both in vacuum and in matter. We show that this simulation, in the continuum limit, reproduces a set of coupled Dirac equations that describe neutrino flavor oscillations, and we make use of this to establish a connection with neutrino phenomenology, thus allowing to fix the parameters of the simulation for a given neutrino experiment. We also analyze how matter effects for neutrino propagation can be simulated in the quantum walk. In this way, important features, such as the MSW effect, can be incorporated. Thus, the simulation of neutrino oscillations with the help of quantum walks might be useful to explore these effects in extreme conditions, such as the solar interior or supernovae, in a complementary way to existing experiments.","authors":["Giuseppe Di Molfetta","Armando Perez"],"meta":["July 2016New Journal of Physics 18(10)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/18/10/103038"],"references":["279458406_Implementation_of_Multidimensional_Quantum_Walks_using_Linear_Optics_and_Classical_Light","274967454_Quantum_Lattice_Boltzmann_is_a_quantum_walk","262732632_Neutrino_oscillations_refitted","262108775_Optical_Simulation_of_Neutrino_Oscillations_in_Binary_Waveguide_Arrays","258393682_Reactor_Neutrinos","257309864_Two-component_Dirac-like_Hamiltonian_for_generating_quantum_walk_on_one-_two-_and_three-dimensional_lattices","278925254_Quantum_random_walks","269635994_Landau_levels_for_discrete-time_quantum_walks_in_artificial_magnetic_fields","265318323_Remarks_on_the_Unified_Model_of_Elementary_Particles","258843368_Neutrino_Cosmology"]}
