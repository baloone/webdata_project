{"id":"323344093_Secure_cloud_data_storage_approach_in_e-learning_systems","abstract":"This is the period of worldwide communication which is a very interesting and inspiring time in the domain of information technology. The modern daily lives may enrich based on Technical advancement in the internet sector. The gaining attractiveness of sophistication on the internet field, the creation of improved web oriented learning environment is become the interesting and latest area on researching remote education. The cloud computing based e-learning is plays a crucial and most powerful role in the area of education and learning. This paper proposes to encrypt the message using data encryption standard and to encode the message using erasure code before storing the message in the e-learning storage system. At the end of encoding, the encoded messages are saved in cloud data center. So, reconstruction is easy with low bandwidth and low traffic if any data center failure and Storing time is convincingly good in Reed Solomon code. It is mainly focused on distributed data storage security for e-learning system, which has always been an important aspect of quality service.","authors":["G. Sahaya Stalin Jose","C.
