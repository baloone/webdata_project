A key technical result, possibly of independent interest, is the existence of subsets such that almost all k-tuples of distinct integers are multiplicatively independent (if k is not too large), and as . For q a large prime, this is used to show that the number of solutions to a certain large and sparse system of -linear forms “behaves randomly” in the sense that .
