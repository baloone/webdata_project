{"id":"51921221_GEM_at_10_A_Decade's_Experience_with_the_Guideline_Elements_Model","abstract":"The Guideline Elements Model (GEM) was developed in 2000 to organize the information contained in clinical practice guidelines using XML and to represent guideline content in a form that can be understood by human readers and processed by computers. In this work, we systematically reviewed the literature to better understand how GEM was being used, potential barriers to its use, and suggestions for improvement. Fifty external and twelve internally produced publications were identified and analyzed. GEM was used most commonly for modeling and ontology creation. Other investigators applied GEM for knowledge extraction and data mining, for clinical decision support for guideline generation. The GEM Cutter software-used to markup guidelines for translation into XML- has been downloaded 563 times since 2000. Although many investigators found GEM to be valuable, others critiqued its failure to clarify guideline semantics, difficulties in markup, and the fact that GEM files are not usually executable.","authors":["Negin Hajizadeh","Nitu Kashyap","George Michel","Richard Shiffman"],"meta":["January 2011AMIA ...
