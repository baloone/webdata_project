{"id":"315038341_A_Massive_Parallel_Fast_Marching_Method","abstract":"In this paper we present a novel technique based on domain decomposition which enables us to perform the fast marching method (FMM) [4] on massive parallel high performance computers (HPC) for given triangulated geometries. The FMM is a widely used numerical method and one of the fastest serial state-of-the-art techniques for computing the solution to the Eikonal equation.","authors":["Petr Kotas","Roberto Croce","Valentina Poletti","Vit Vondrak"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-18827-0_30","In book: Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering XXII (pp.311-318)"],"references":["277056975_Fast_Marching_Methods_-_Parallel_Implementation_and_Analysis","251673902_A_Fast_Iterative_Method_for_a_Class_of_Hamilton-Jacobi_Equations_on_Parallel_Systems","220183514_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Approximation_of_Distance_Maps_on_Parametric_Surfaces","265076090_PARALLEL_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_FAST_MARCHING_METHOD_18337_FINAL_REPORT","235144798_A_Domain_Decomposition_Parallelization_of_the_Fast_Marching_Method","11742606_A_Marching_Level_Set_Method_for_Monotonically_Advancing_Fronts"]}
