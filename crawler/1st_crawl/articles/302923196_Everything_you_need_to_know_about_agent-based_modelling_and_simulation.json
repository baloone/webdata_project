{"id":"302923196_Everything_you_need_to_know_about_agent-based_modelling_and_simulation","abstract":"This paper addresses the background and current state of the field of agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS). It revisits the issue of ABMS represents as a new development, considering the extremes of being an overhyped fad, doomed to disappear, or a revolutionary development, shifting fundamental paradigms of how research is conducted. This paper identifies key ABMS resources, publications, and communities. It also proposes several complementary definitions for ABMS, based on practice, intended to establish a common vocabulary for understanding ABMS, which seems to be lacking. It concludes by suggesting research challenges for ABMS to advance and realize its potential in the coming years.","authors":["C. M.
