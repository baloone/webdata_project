We applied a fast method of image analysis using Self Organized Maps (SOM) and, more specifically, the quantization error (QE), for the visualization of critical changes in satellite images of Lake Mead, generated across the years 1984-2009. The QE from the SOM output is a reliable measure of variability in local contrast/colour contents. In the present work, we use statistical trend analysis to show how the QE from SOM trained on images of this specific geographic region of interest, extracted from NASA satellite images, can be exploited for visualizing critical changes in water levels of the lake across the reference time period, at a glance. The QE is proven significantly correlated with the Hoover Dam Control Room water level statistics for the same reference time period. Image ranking using SOM-QE is fast and reliable, and can be implemented for the rapid detection of potentially critical changes in time series of large bodies of satellite images.","authors":["John Mwangi Wandeto","Henry Nyongesa","Birgitta Dresp"],"meta":["April 2019Perception 48(1 - ECVP Supplement):1-233","Project: Data quality under the principle of parsimony"],"references":[]}
