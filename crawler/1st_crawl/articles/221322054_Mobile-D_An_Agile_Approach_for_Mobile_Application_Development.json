{"id":"221322054_Mobile-D_An_Agile_Approach_for_Mobile_Application_Development","abstract":"Mobile phones have been closed environments until recent years. The change brought by open platform technologies such as the Symbian operating system and Java technologies has opened up a significant business opportunity for anyone to develop application software such as games for mobile terminals. However, developing mobile applications is currently a challenging task due to the specific demands and technical constraints of mobile development. Furthermore, at the moment very little is known about the suitability of the different development processes for mobile application development. Due to these issues, we have developed an agile development approach called Mobile-D. The Mobile-D approach is briefly outlined here and the experiences gained from four case studies are discussed.","authors":["Pekka Abrahamsson","Antti Hanhineva","Hanna Hulkko","Tuomas Ihme"],"meta":["January 2004","DOI:10.1145/1028664.1028736","SourceDBLP","Conference: Companion to the 19th Annual ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications, OOPSLA 2004, October 24-28, 2004, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"references":["235309803_Antecedents_of_project_learning_and_time-to-market_during_new_mobile_service_development","4016795_New_directions_on_agile_methods_A_comparative_analysis","235307502_Restructuring_in_European_telecommunications_Modeling_the_evolving_market","220133884_Mobile_Commerce_Framework_Applications_and_Networking_Support"]}
