{"id":"340555902_Cyberbullying_Perpetration_and_Victimization_in_Youth_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Longitudinal_Studies","abstract":"Cyberbullying perpetration (CP) and victimization (CV) are prevalent issues in adolescent development. However, previous meta-analyses focused only on cross-sectional findings. The present study aims to meta-analytically summarize 56 longitudinal studies on CP, CV, and related factors in children and adolescents. Forty meta-analyses on CP and CV as both predictors and outcomes of person-related, Internet activity-related, and contextual factors were performed. Additional moderator analyses took into account study design, sample population, and quality of the studies. Results highlight reciprocal longitudinal effects among CP, CV, and both traditional bullying and victimization: CP causes externalizing problem behaviors over time, whereas CV constitutes a risk factor of internalizing problems, such as depression and anxiety. Conversely, behavioral problems and increased Internet use predict involvement in CP, while depression, anxiety, and Internet use also predict CV over time. Further longitudinal research is needed to provide empirical evidence on understudied concepts.","authors":["Laura Marciano","Peter J Schulz","Anne-Linda Camerini"],"meta":["April 2020Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 25(2)","DOI:10.1093/jcmc/zmz031","Project: MEDIATICINO2.0"],"references":["335956997_Cochrane_Handbook_for_Systematic_Reviews_of_Interventions","333186833_School_Bullying_Development_and_Some_Important_Challenges","326117728_Protective_factors_against_bullying_and_cyberbullying_A_systematic_review_of_meta-analyses","325982589_Media_Violence_and_the_General_Aggression_Model","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","323222779_A_developmental_approach_to_cyberbullying_Prevalence_and_protective_factors","313178612_Measuring_inconsistency_in_meta-analysis","312412474_Face-to-face_bullying_and_cyberbullying_in_adolescents_Trans-contextual_effects_and_role_overlap","312323374_Associations_between_social_media_and_cyberbullying_a_review_of_the_literature","308537097_Longitudinal_patterns_of_involvement_in_cyberbullying_Results_from_a_Latent_Transition_Analysis"]}
