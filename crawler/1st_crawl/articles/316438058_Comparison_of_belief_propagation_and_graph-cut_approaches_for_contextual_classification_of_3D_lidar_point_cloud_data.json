{"id":"316438058_Comparison_of_belief_propagation_and_graph-cut_approaches_for_contextual_classification_of_3D_lidar_point_cloud_data","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the classification of lidar point cloud data acquired via mobile laser scanning, whereby the classification relies on a context model based on a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We present two approximate inference algorithms based on belief propagation, as well as a graph-cut-based approach not yet applied in this context. To demonstrate the performance of our approach, we present the classification results derived for a standard benchmark dataset. These results clearly indicate that the graph-cut-based method is able to retrieve a labeling of higher likelihood in only a fraction of the time needed for the other approaches. The higher likelihood, in turn, translates into a significant gain in the accuracy of the obtained classification.","authors":["Loic Landrieu","Cl√©ment Mallet","Martin Weinmann"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127571","Conference: IGARSS'17At: Fort Worth, USA","Project: Semantic segmentation of large 3D point clouds"],"references":["242731335_Airborne_LIDAR_feature_selection_for_urban_classification_using_random_forests","307531656_Fast_semantic_segmentation_of_3d_point_clouds_with_strongly_varying_density","288906520_Random_forests","272891952_Semantic_point_cloud_interpretation_based_on_optimal_neighborhoods_relevant_features_and_efficient_classifiers","261155267_Classification_of_urban_LiDAR_data_using_conditional_random_field_and_random_forests","257207734_Non-associative_Markov_networks_for_3D_point_cloud_classification","243773059_Efficient_Approximate_Energy_Minimization_via_Graph_Cuts","236157558_The_Viterbi_algorithm","235890211_The_Viterbi_algorithm","235410460_Understanding_belief_propagation_and_its_generalizations"]}
