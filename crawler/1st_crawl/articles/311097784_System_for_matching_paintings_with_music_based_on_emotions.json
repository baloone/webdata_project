{"id":"311097784_System_for_matching_paintings_with_music_based_on_emotions","abstract":"People experience various emotions when they interact with artistic content such as music and visual art in the form of paintings. Thus, painters and composers use features in music and paintings to influence people emotionally. An analysis of methods employed to create features to influence people using paintings and music indicated that people apparently do not find it difficult to understand artistic content. When people view paintings, listening to music that creates a mood similar to that portrayed by the paintings could be helpful to understand the painter's intention.\nIn this work, we extract the emotions from music and paintings depending on their features. Based on these extracted emotions, the proposed system suggests the most appropriate music to accompany a given image, and vice versa. In addition, based on our algorithm, we developed a mobile application that could assist people to enjoy music and paintings emotionally.","authors":["Taemin Lee","Hyunki Lim","Dae-Won Kim","Sunkyu Hwang"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1145/3005358.3005366","Conference: SIGGRAPH ASIA 2016 Technical Briefs"],"references":["235604845_Norms_of_valence_arousal_and_dominance_for_13915_English_lemmas","235361517_A_Circumplex_Model_of_Affect","224606772_Classifying_paintings_by_artistic_genre_An_analysis_of_features_classifiers","221264496_From_Physiological_Signals_to_Emotions_Implementing_and_Comparing_Selected_Methods_for_Feature_Extraction_and_Classification","221122984_Emotional_valence_categorization_using_holistic_image_features","220723440_MIR_in_Matlab_II_A_Toolbox_for_Musical_Feature_Extraction_from_Audio","220723083_jAudio_An_Feature_Extraction_Library","3458005_A_Regression_Approach_to_Music_Emotion_Recognition","2544463_MARSYAS_a_framework_for_audio_analysis","261246844_Affective_Music_Recommendation_System_Reflecting_the_Mood_of_Input_Image","229569563_The_aim_and_method_of_the_Color_Image_Scale","228695729_Music_emotion_recognition_A_state_of_the_art_review","220723155_Evaluation_of_Feature_Extractors_and_Psycho-Acoustic_Transformations_for_Music_Genre_Classification","220722987_State_of_the_Art_Report_Music_Emotion_Recognition_A_State_of_the_Art_Review"]}
