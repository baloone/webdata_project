{"id":"260881474_On_the_relationship_between_cellular_automata_and_L-systemsThe_self-replication_case","abstract":"Cellular automata (CAs) have been ubiquitously used over the years to\nstudy the issue of self-replication. The L-systems model, on the other\nhand, is naturally suited for modeling growth processes, of which\nreplication is a special case. The goals of this paper are: (1) to show\nhow L-systems can be used to specify self-replicating structures, and\n(2) to explore the relationship between L-systems and CAs. We conclude\nthat the bridge between CAs and L-systems seems to offer a promising\napproach in the study of self-replication, and, more generally, of\ngrowth processes in CAs.","authors":["Andr√© Stauffer","Moshe Sipper"],"meta":["May 1998Physica D Nonlinear Phenomena 116(1-2):71-80","DOI:10.1016/S0167-2789(97)00255-8"],"references":["220693404_Cellular_Automata_Machines","6108774_Simple_Systems_That_Exhibit_Self-Directed_Replication","3418511_A_Phylogenetic_Ontogenetic_and_Epigenetic_View_of_Bio-Inspired_Hardware_Systems","312893521_Mathematical_models_for_cellular_interaction_in_development_parts_I_and_II","279235721_Mathematical_Models_for_Cellular_Interactions_in_Development_Parts_I_and_II","267990993_Evolving_Uniform_and_Non-uniform_Cellular_Automata_Networks","247482983_Self-Reproduction_in_Cellular_Automata_in_Physica_10D","237005555_Self-Reproduction_in_Small_Cellular_Automata","222481878_Co-evolving_non-uniform_cellular_automata_to_perform_computations","222472791_Cellular_Automata_Models_of_Self-replicating_Systems","222470114_Evolving_cellular_automata_to_perform_computations_Mechanisms_and_impediments","222450656_Langton_CG_Self_Reproduction_in_Cellular_Automata_Physica_D_10_135-144","222183899_Toward_a_viable_self-reproducing_universal_computer","220692783_The_Algrithmic_Beauty_of_Plants","220688106_Evolution_of_Parallel_Cellular_Machines_The_Cellular_Programming_Approach","216212090_Nanosystems_Molecular_Machinery_Manufacturing_and_Computation","37811203_The_Theory_of_Self-Reproducing_Automata","17527103_Mathematical_models_for_cellular_interactions_in_development_I_Filaments_with_one-sided_inputs","14071323_The_evolution_of_parallel_cellular_machines_Toward_evolware","3623517_Discovery_of_Self-Replicating_Structures_Using_A_Genetic_Algorithm","3488972_Three_models_for_the_description_of_language_IRE_Trans_Inf_Theor_2113-124","2798147_A_New_Self-Reproducing_Cellular_Automaton_Capable_of_Construction_and_Computation"]}
