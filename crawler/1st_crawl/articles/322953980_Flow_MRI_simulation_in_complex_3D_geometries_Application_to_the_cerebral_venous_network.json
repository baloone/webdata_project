Simulation of MR spin flow motion is of high interest in the study of flow artifacts and angiography. However, at present, only a few simulators include this option and most are restricted to static tissue imaging.\n\nTheory and methods: \nAn extension of JEMRIS, one of the most advanced high performance open-source simulation platforms to date, was developed. The implementation of a Lagrangian description of the flow allows simulating any MR experiment, including both static tissues and complex flow data from computational fluid dynamics. Simulations of simple flow models are compared with real experiments on a physical flow phantom. A realistic simulation of 3D flow MRI on the cerebral venous network is also carried out.\n\nResults: \nSimulations and real experiments are in good agreement. The generality of the framework is illustrated in 2D and 3D with some common flow artifacts (misregistration and inflow enhancement) and with the three main angiographic techniques: phase contrast velocimetry (PC), time-of-flight, and contrast-enhanced imaging MRA.\n\nConclusion: \nThe framework provides a versatile and reusable tool for the simulation of any MRI experiment including physiological fluids and arbitrarily complex flow motion.","authors":["Alexandre Fortin","St√©phanie Salmon","Joseph Baruthio","Maya Delbany"],"meta":["February 2018Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 80(4)","DOI:10.1002/mrm.27114"],"references":["314087538_Curvilinear_Structure_Analysis_by_Ranking_the_Orientation_Responses_of_Path_Operators","280968508_4D_flow_cardiovascular_magnetic_resonance_consensus_statement","263746625_High_performance_MRI_simulations_of_motion_on_multi-GPU_systems","261750739_Computer_Simulation_of_Magnetic_Resonance_Angiography_Imaging_Model_Description_and_Validation","40729773_Bloch_simulations_with_intra-voxel_spin_dephasing","21035012_Spatial_misregistration_of_vascular_flow_during_MR_imaging_of_the_CNS_Cause_and_clinical_significance","12566194_Fabrication_of_elastomer_arterial_models_with_specified_compliance","11369101_On_Assessing_the_Quality_of_Particle_Tracking_Through_Computational_Fluid_Dynamic_Models","283206725_Blood_flow_in_the_cerebral_venous_system_modeling_and_simulation","236947929_Computational_modeling_of_MR_flow_imaging_by_the_lattice_Boltzmann_method_and_Bloch_equation","51642954_On_the_numerically_predicted_spatial_BOLD_fMRI_specificity_for_spin_echo_sequences","44799985_High-performance_computing_MRI_simulations_Magn_Reson_Med_641p186-p193","44699154_Simulation_of_Phase_Contrast_MRI_of_Turbulent_Flow","43051689_Computational_Simulations_and_Experimental_Studies_of_3D_Phase-Contrast_Imaging_of_Fluid_Flow_in_Carotid_Bifurcation_Geometries","16665227_A_Computer_Algorithm_for_the_Simulation_of_any_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_NMR_Imaging_Method","13631251_Pulse_Sequences_for_Steady-State_Saturation_of_Flowing_Spins","13191820_A_numerical_study_of_magnetic_resonance_images_of_pulsatile_flow_in_a_two_dimensional_carotid_bifurcation_-_A_numerical_study_of_MR_images","8638500_MRI_Simulator_with_object-specific_field_map_calculations","8026624_The_SIMRI_project_a_versatile_and_interactive_MRI_simulator","7869125_Numerical_Simulation_of_Magnetic_Resonance_Angiographies_of_an_Anatomically_Realistic_Stenotic_Carotid_Bifurcation","7339729_Efficient_simulation_of_magnetic_resonance_imaging_with_Bloch-Torrey_equations_using_intra-voxel_magnetization_gradients","6944997_Development_of_a_functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging_simulator_for_modeling_realistic_rigid-body_motion_artifacts","6889673_Numerical_simulations_of_phase_contrast_velocity_mapping_of_complex_flows_in_an_anatomically_realistic_bypass_graft_geometry","3221036_MRI_simulation-based_evaluation_of_image-processing_and_classification_methods"]}
