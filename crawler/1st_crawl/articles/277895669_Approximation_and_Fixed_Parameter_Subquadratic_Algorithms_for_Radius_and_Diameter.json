{"id":"277895669_Approximation_and_Fixed_Parameter_Subquadratic_Algorithms_for_Radius_and_Diameter","abstract":"The radius and diameter are fundamental graph parameters. They are defined as\nthe minimum and maximum of the eccentricities in a graph, respectively, where\nthe eccentricity of a vertex is the largest distance from the vertex to another\nnode. In directed graphs, there are several versions of these problems. For\ninstance, one may choose to define the eccentricity of a node in terms of the\nlargest distance into the node, out of the node, the sum of the two directions\n(i.e. roundtrip) and so on. All versions of diameter and radius can be solved\nvia solving all-pairs shortest paths (APSP), followed by a fast postprocessing\nstep. Solving APSP, however, on $n$-node graphs requires $\\Omega(n^2)$ time\neven in sparse graphs, as one needs to output $n^2$ distances.\nMotivated by known and new negative results on the impossibility of computing\nthese measures exactly in general graphs in truly subquadratic time, under\nplausible assumptions, we search for \\emph{approximation} and \\emph{fixed\nparameter subquadratic} algorithms, and for reasons why they do not exist.\nOur results include: - Truly subquadratic approximation algorithms for most\nof the versions of Diameter and Radius with \\emph{optimal} approximation\nguarantees (given truly subquadratic time), under plausible assumptions. In\nparticular, there is a $2$-approximation algorithm for directed Radius with\none-way distances that runs in $\\tilde{O}(m\\sqrt{n})$ time, while a\n$(2-\\delta)$-approximation algorithm in $O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ time is unlikely. -\nOn graphs with treewidth $k$, we can solve the problems in\n$2^{O(k\\log{k})}n^{1+o(1)}$ time. We show that these algorithms are near\noptimal since even a $(3/2-\\delta)$-approximation algorithm that runs in time\n$2^{o(k)}n^{2-\\epsilon}$ would refute the plausible assumptions.","authors":["Amir Abboud","Virginia Vassilevska Williams","Joshua Wang"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611974331.ch28","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265252616_Computing_Classic_Closeness_Centrality_at_Scale","264084789_Into_the_Square_-_On_the_Complexity_of_Quadratic-Time_Solvable_Problems","236263982_A_Ock_n_5-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Treewidth","220780370_On_the_Possibility_of_Faster_SAT_Algorithms","220770077_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Central_Vertex_of_a_Chordal_Graph","220209632_The_Absolute_Center_of_a_Network","51963417_On_Problems_as_Hard_as_CNF-Sat","313674816_Optimum_Locations_of_Switching_Centers_and_the_Absolute_Centers_and_Medians_of_a_Graph","308846160_Tight_Hardness_Results_for_LCS_and_Other_Sequence_Similarity_Measures","284792486_Diameters_of_Graphs_Old_Probnlems_and_New_Results","281605263_Subcubic_Equivalences_Between_Graph_Centrality_Problems_APSP_and_Diameter","273525229_Fast_diameter_and_radius_BFS-based_computation_in_Weakly_Connected_real-world_graphs","271855479_Quadratic_Conditional_Lower_Bounds_for_String_Problems_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping","271532334_Quadratic-Time_Hardness_of_LCS_and_other_Sequence_Similarity_Measures","269040603_Edit_Distance_Cannot_Be_Computed_in_Strongly_Subquadratic_Time_unless_SETH_is_false","268819918_Faster_Language_Edit_Distance_Connection_to_All-pairs_Shortest_Paths_and_Related_Problems","268633470_Consequences_of_Faster_Alignment_of_Sequences","262281728_Fast_approximation_algorithms_for_the_diameter_and_radius_of_sparse_graphs","261439607_Why_Walking_the_Dog_Takes_Time_Frechet_Distance_Has_No_Strongly_Subquadratic_Algorithms_Unless_SETH_Fails","260022136_Popular_Conjectures_Imply_Strong_Lower_Bounds_for_Dynamic_Problems","257650163_Invitation_to_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms","243182915_All-Pairs_Shortest_Paths_for_Unweighted_Undirected_Graphs_in_omn_Time","225621879_Finding_and_Counting_Given_Length_Cycles","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222646777_Algorithms_for_graphs_of_bounded_treewidth_via_orthogonal_range_searching","222560787_Diameter_Determination_On_Restricted_Graph_Families","222521916_On_the_complexity_of_k-SAT","222062402_Compact_roundtrip_routing_in_directed_networks","221936125_Optimum_Locations_of_Switching_Centres_and_the_Absolute_Centres_and_Medians_of_A_Graph","221591061_Sublinear_Time_Algorithms_for_Metric_Space_Problems","221498269_Distance_Oracles_beyond_the_Thorup--Zwick_Bound","221343911_Compact_roundtrip_routing_in_directed_networks_extended_abstract","221219821_Faster_Approximation_of_Distances_in_Graphs","220779921_Networks_Cannot_Compute_Their_Diameter_in_Sublinear_Time","220753116_Treewidth_Characterizations_Applications_and_Computations","220616824_Fast_Estimation_of_Diameter_and_Shortest_Paths_Without_Matrix_Multiplication","220431788_Chazelle_B_A_minimum_spanning_tree_algorithm_with_inverse-ackermann_type_complexity_Journal_of_the_ACM_476_1028-1047","220151040_Efficient_algorithms_for_center_problems_in_cactus_networks","24061828_The_Centrality_Index_of_a_Graph","2942170_On_Dynamic_Shortest_Paths_Problems","2876444_Roundtrip_Spanners_and_Roundtrip_Routing_in_Directed_Graphs","2731513_Compact_Roundtrip_Routing_for_Digraphs","2527856_Dynamic_Programming_On_Graphs_With_Bounded_Treewidth","1961531_Subgraph_Isomorphism_in_Planar_Graphs_and_Related_Problems"]}
