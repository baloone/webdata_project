{"id":"311479659_Parameter_Optimization_of_Three_Phase_Boost_Inverter_Using_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Linear_Loads","abstract":"A high performance offline genetic algorithm based three phase boost inverter has been proposed in this work. The digital PI controller makes use of the offline genetic algorithm to improve the performance of the three phase boost inverter. The offline genetic algorithm is used to improve the dynamic response and decrease the content of total harmonic distortion in the three phase boost inverter. The genetic algorithm decreases the effect of the parameters such as rise time, settling time, peak overshoot and steady state error which influence the dynamic response of the system. The overall system efficiency and reliability is shown to be enhanced due to the offline genetic algorithm. The content of total harmonic distortion is also shown to be decreased due to the proposed offline genetic algorithm.","authors":["Arunkumar Gopal","I. Gnanambal","S. Naresh","P.C.
