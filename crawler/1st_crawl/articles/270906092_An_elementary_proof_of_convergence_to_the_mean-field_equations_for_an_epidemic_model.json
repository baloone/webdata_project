{"id":"270906092_An_elementary_proof_of_convergence_to_the_mean-field_equations_for_an_epidemic_model","abstract":"It is common to use a compartmental, fluid model described by a system of\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model disease spread. In addition to\ntheir simplicity, these models are also the mean-field approximations of more\naccurate stochastic models of disease spread on contact networks. For the\nsimplest case of a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) process\n(infection with recovery) on a complete network, it has been shown that the\nfraction of infected nodes converges to the mean-field ODE as the number of\nnodes increases. However the proofs are not simple, requiring sophisticated\nprobability, partial differential equations (PDE), or infinite systems of ODEs.\nWe provide a short proof in this case for convergence in mean-square on finite\ntime intervals using a system of two ODEs and a moment inequality.","authors":["Benjamin Armbruster","Ekkehard Beck"],"meta":["January 2016IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics 82(1)","DOI:10.1093/imamat/hxw010","SourcearXiv"],"references":["233840902_What_drives_the_US_and_Peruvian_HIV_epidemics_in_men_who_have_sex_with_men_MSM","228496267_From_exact_stochastic_to_mean-field_ODE_models_a_case_study_of_three_different_approaches_to_prove_convergence_results","221241705_The_effect_of_network_topology_on_the_spread_of_epidemics","216637120_Solutions_of_Ordinary_Differential_Equations_as_Limits_of_Pure_Jump_Markov_Processes","48376881_Mathematical_Epidemiology_of_Infectious_Diseases_Model_Building_Analysis_and_Interpretation","43349251_Exact_epidemic_models_on_graphs_using_graph-automorphism_driven_lumping","11139742_Modeling_Dynamic_and_Network_Heterogeneities_in_the_Spread_of_Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases","6937027_Networks_and_Epidemic_Models","6197494_When_individual_behaviour_matters_Homogeneous_and_network_models_in_epidemiology","303720949_Limit_Theorems_for_Sequences_of_Jump_Markov_Processes_Approximating_Ordinary_Differential_Processes","230692936_Infectious_Diseases_of_Humans","227990815_Correlation_Equations_and_Pair_Approximations_for_Spatial_Ecologies","216636744_Limit_Theorems_for_Sequences_of_Jump_Markov_Processes_Approximating_Ordinary_Differential_Processes","50336570_Ordinary_Differential_Equation","44543569_Infectious_diseases_of_humans_dynamics_and_control_Roy_M_Anderson_and_Robert_M_May","44489889_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Infectious_Diseases_and_Its_Applications","12638707_Individual-based_Perspectives_on_R0","8080930_The_Implications_of_Network_Structure_for_Epidemic_Dynamics"]}
