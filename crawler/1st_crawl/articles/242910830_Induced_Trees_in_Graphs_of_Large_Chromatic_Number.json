{"id":"242910830_Induced_Trees_in_Graphs_of_Large_Chromatic_Number","abstract":"Gyárfás and Sumner independently conjectured that for every tree T and integer k there is an integer f(k, T) such that every graph G with χ(G) > f(k, t) contains either Kk or an induced copy of T. We prove a ‘topological’ version of the conjecture: for every tree T and integer k there is g(k,T) such that every graph G with χ(G) > g(k,t) contains either Kk or an induced copy of a subdivision of T. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","authors":["A.
