{"id":"277942106_Sum-connectivity_index_of_a_graph","abstract":"Let G be a simple connected graph, and let d\n\ni\nbe the degree of its i-th vertex. The sum-connectivity index of the graph G is defined as \\(\\chi (G) = \\sum\\nolimits_{v_i v_j \\in E(G)} {(d_i + d_j )^{ - 1/2} } \\). We discuss the effect on χ(G) of inserting an edge into a graph. Moreover, we obtain the relations between sum-connectivity index and Randić index.","authors":["K. Ch.
