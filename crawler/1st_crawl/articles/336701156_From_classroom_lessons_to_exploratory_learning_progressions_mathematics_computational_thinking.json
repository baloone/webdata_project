{"id":"336701156_From_classroom_lessons_to_exploratory_learning_progressions_mathematics_computational_thinking","abstract":"This paper presents findings from a two-year qualitative study examining integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) into elementary mathematics instruction. Integrated units were developed by elementary teachers and CS/CT coaches with support from university faculty with expertise in CS/CT and elementary mathematics. CS/CT instruction primarily relied on the Scratch environment, although some lessons made use of Code.org materials. This research primarily relied on two theories of integration (i.e. Kiray, 2012. A new model for the integration of science and mathematics: The balance model. Energy Education Science and Technology Part B: Social and Educational Studies, 4(3), 1181â€“1196) that provided insight into the level of interconnection between the disciplines and the relative amount of instructional time spent within each discipline. Findings revealed that cross-grade CS/CT concepts included sequencing, looping, and conditional logic. Within each category: (a) concepts were taught with increasing complexity across the grades, (b) the mathematics was dominant and CS/CT was important but secondary, and (c) three types of lessons emerged: No integration, partial integration, and full integration. Lastly, lessons generally included a transition from less integrated to more integrated activities with an initial focus on discipline-specific conceptual understanding prior to integrated activities.","authors":["Maya Israel","Todd Lash"],"meta":["October 2019Interactive Learning Environments 28(3):1-21","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2019.1674879"],"references":["314489807_Advancing_Elementary_and_Middle_School_STEM_Education","288068050_A_new_model_for_the_integration_of_science_and_mathematics_The_balance_model","284352052_Teacher's_Toolkit_Exploring_the_Science_Framework_and_NGSS_Computational_Thinking_in_the_Science_Classroom","283155060_Defining_Computational_Thinking_for_Mathematics_and_Science_Classrooms","265797241_New_frameworks_for_studying_and_assessing_the_development_of_computational_thinking","258933027_Learning_Trajectories_in_Mathematics_A_Foundation_for_Standards_Curriculum_Assessment_and_Instruction","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","240807798_Document_Analysis_as_a_Qualitative_Research_Method","234820368_The_Scratch_Programming_Language_and_Environment","234810765_Computational_thinking_for_youth_in_practice","233300911_Learning_Trajectories_in_Mathematics_Education","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","345543001_Integrated_STEM_Education","342183905_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_for_Nominal_Scales","322611929_Cultivating_Computational_Thinking_Practices_and_Mathematical_Habits_of_Mind_in_Lattice_Land","319134131_K-8_Learning_Trajectories_Derived_from_Research_Literature_Sequence_Repetition_Conditionals","317953655_Designing_and_conducting_mixed_methods_research","317953357_The_discovery_of_grounded_theory","315446328_From_Blocks_to_Text_and_Back_Programming_Patterns_in_a_Dual-Modality_Environment","307552972_Debunking_Myths_about_the_Standards_for_Mathematical_Practice","288957532_Qualitative_content_analysis_Forum_Qualitative_Social_Research_Theories_Methods_Applications","287684805_STEM_-_Beyond_the_acronym","283672719_Transferring_Skills_at_Solving_Word_Problems_from_Computing_to_Algebra_Through_Bootstrap","282748526_Integrating_computational_thinking_across_the_K-8_curriculum","272011807_Learning_trajectories_a_framework_for_connecting_standards_with_curriculum","246719788_LogoBlocks_A_Graphical_Programming_Language_for_Interacting_with_the_World","242513310_Software_Design_as_a_Learning_Environment","237232508_Principles_and_Standards_for_School_Mathematics_A_Guide_for_Mathematicians","237130375_Habits_of_mind_An_organizing_principle_for_mathematics_curricula","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","220017506_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_For_Nominal_Scales","49793185_What_is_a_spiral_curriculum"]}
