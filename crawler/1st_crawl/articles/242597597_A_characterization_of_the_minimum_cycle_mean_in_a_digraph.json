{"id":"242597597_A_characterization_of_the_minimum_cycle_mean_in_a_digraph","abstract":"Let C = (V,E) be a digraph with n vertices. Let f be a function from E into the real numbers, associating with each edge e ∈ E a weight f{hook}(e). Given any sequence of edges σ = e1,e2,...,ep define w(σ), the weight of σ, as ∑ i = 1 p f{hook}(ei), and define m(σ), the mean weight of σ, as w(σ){plus 45 degree rule}p. Let λ* = minCm(C) where C ranges over all directed cycles in G; λ* is called the minimum cycle mean. We give a simple characterization of λ*, as well as an algorithm for computing it efficiently.","authors":["Richard M.
