{"id":"324887929_Artificial_Intelligence_Transforming_Dentistry_Today","abstract":"With the enormous increase in the documented inform\nation and patient data, intelligent software for co\nmputation of this data has \nbecome a necessity. From data processing and findin\ng relevant information to using neural networks for\ndiagnosis and to the \nintroduction of augmented reality and virtual reali\nty in dental education, Artificial intelligence has\nfound a number of \napplications in the field of medicine and dentistry\n. The introduction of robotics to the field of surg\nery has increased the precision \nand made surgical procedure more predictable. Virtu\nal assistants that apply Artificial Intelligence so\nftware are helping dentists to \ndiagnose cases accurately and treat patients effici\nently without missing any relevant genetic informat\nion. Even with these \namazing advances artificial intelligence may still \nbe in its infancy and in no way can replace human i\nntelligence and skill. \nNevertheless, this technology is helping create mor\ne awareness regarding oral and maxillofacial diseas\nes and risk factors while \nalso encouraging patients to seek early treatment. \nThe culmination of artificial intelligence along wi\nth digitization has seen a new \nera in the field of dentistry and its future aspect\ns appear extremely promising. \nKeywords\n: Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Clinica\nl Decision Supporting System, Virtual Reality.","authors":["Sunali Khanna","Prita Dhaimade"],"meta":["May 2018"],"references":["305664630_Comparison_of_the_accuracy_of_direct_and_indirect_three-dimensional_digitizing_processes_for_CADCAM_systems_-_An_in_vitro_study","262816041_Clinical_Use_of_Virtual_Reality_Distraction_System_to_Reduce_Anxiety_and_Pain_in_Dental_Procedures","271227214_Smartphone_applications_for_melanoma_detection_by_community_patient_and_generalist_clinician_users_A_review","270960233_An_intelligent_tutoring_system_for_visual_classification_problem_solving","264245805_Bioprinting_technology_and_its_applications","262781974_Intraoral_scanning_of_hard_and_soft_tissues_for_partial_removable_dental_prosthesis_fabrication","257384127_Selected_techniques_for_data_mining_in_medicine","249958367_Octree-based_Virtual_Dental_Training_System_with_a_Haptic_Device","236408381_Applying_soft_computing_techniques_to_optimise_a_dental_milling_process","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence"]}
