{"id":"325450967_A_Systematic_Review_of_Gamification_Research_In_Pursuit_of_Homo_Ludens","abstract":"Gamification is an innovative approach that aims to increase users' engagement and motivation and provide sustainable experiences. It has recently become widely known and is an approach that is being used in many fields. This article intends to identify and map trends and patterns in gamification research. For this purpose, this article employs a systematic review in which document and content analysis were used. Research findings have revealed that conceptual/descriptive papers outweigh other type of papers; however, quantitative and qualitative papers are showing an increasing trend. Lexical analysis demonstrated that education, teaching, and learning; engagement, motivation, and behavior change, and gamified designs, are emerging concepts. Keyword analysis revealed that gamification, engagement, and motivation are most frequently used keywords. Gamification articles are mostly related to the education field. Self-Determination Theory, Flow Theory, and MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetic) Framework appeared to be the most beneficial lenses in gamification studies.","authors":["Aras Bozkurt","GÃ¼rhan Durak"],"meta":["July 2018International Journal of Game-Based Learning 8(3)","DOI:10.4018/ijgbl.2018070102"],"references":["327198883_Gamification_for_Health_and_WellbeingA_Systematic_Review_of_the_Literature","324730950_Gamification_Education_and_E-learning_An_interview_with_Andrzej_Marczewski","319133380_Trends_and_Patterns_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_Review_and_Content_Analysis_of_Research_on_MOOCs_2008-2015","347492813_Conducting_Research_Social_and_Behavioral_Science_Methods","324333785_Content_Analysis_in_Communication_Research","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","314280472_The_Design_Play_and_Experience_Framework","313637745_Where_It's_At_A_Content_Analysis_and_Appraisal_of_the_Journal_of_Leisure_Research","312662565_A_descriptive_literature_review_and_classification_framework_for_gamification_in_information_systems","306012133_The_use_of_gamification_in_education_A_bibliometric_and_text_mining_analysis","305708437_GAMIFICATION_IN_HIGHER_EDUCATION_AND_STEM_A_SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW_OF_LITERATURE","301800257_Gamification_Solutions_to_Enhance_Software_User_Engagement_-_A_Systematic_Review","290460188_Gamification_in_online_collaborative_learning_for_programming_courses_A_literature_review","279059823_A_Literature_Review_of_Gamification_Design_Frameworks","305008852_Research_Methods_Content_Analysis"]}
