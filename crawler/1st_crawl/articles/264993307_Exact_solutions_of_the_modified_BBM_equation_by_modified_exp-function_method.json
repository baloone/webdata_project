{"id":"264993307_Exact_solutions_of_the_modified_BBM_equation_by_modified_exp-function_method","abstract":"In this paper, the modified exp-function method is used to seek generalized wave solutions of modified BBM equation. As a result, some new types of exact traveling wave solutions are obtained which include kink wave solutions, periodic wave solution, and solitary wave solutions. Obtained results clearly indicate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed modified exp-function method.","authors":["Yinghui He","Shaolin Li","Yao Long"],"meta":["February 2012"],"references":["220558738_New_periodic_and_soliton_solutions_for_the_Generalized_BBM_and_Burgers-BBM_equations","243258582_New_travelling_wave_solutions_of_different_physical_structures_to_generalized_BBM_equation","236492705_Fluctuation_spectra_of_a_drift_wave_soliton_gas","222430776_Elliptic_solutions_to_a_generalized_BBM_equation","220557682_Bifurcations_of_travelling_wave_solutions_for_the_generalized_KP-BBM_equation"]}
