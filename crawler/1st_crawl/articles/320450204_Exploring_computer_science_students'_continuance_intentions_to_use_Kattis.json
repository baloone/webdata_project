{"id":"320450204_Exploring_computer_science_students'_continuance_intentions_to_use_Kattis","abstract":"Teaching programming concepts to enhance students’ problem solving and computational thinking skills is a challenging task, especially when students enter college with little to no preparation, or they lack the interest or capacity for programming. Online platforms that serve as automated practice and assessment systems have been offered as potential tools for supporting programming skills development, providing feedback, and motivating students. The present article discusses the use of an online automated practice and assessment system called Kattis for homework assignments and final project in three computer science courses. The goal of the present study was to ascertain students’ continuance intentions to use Kattis. We attempt to address this by using partial least squares on data from a survey of 50 students. The findings of the present study suggest that continuance intentions to use Kattis is driven by students’ level of satisfaction with the system, the degree of students’ confirmation of expectations, and the perceived usefulness of the system.","authors":["Ram Basnet","Tenzin Doleck","David Lemay","Paul Bazelais"],"meta":["May 2018Education and Information Technologies 23(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-017-9658-2","Project: Kattis"],"references":["318354838_The_role_of_behavioral_expectation_in_technology_acceptance_a_CEGEP_case_study","315437737_Investigating_the_predictive_power_of_TAM_A_case_study_of_CEGEP_students'_intentions_to_use_online_learning_technologies","311766005_The_Partial_Least_Squares_Approach_to_Structural_Equation_Modeling","311001627_Examining_CEGEP_students'_acceptance_of_computer-based_learning_environments_A_test_of_two_models","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","317061157_Passion_and_Concern_for_Privacy_as_Factors_Affecting_Snapchat_Use_A_Situated_Perspective_on_Technology_Acceptance","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","299057826_A_Comprehensive_Conceptualization_of_Post-Adoption_Behaviors_Associated_with_Information_Technology_Enabled_Work_Systems","289963485_The_role_of_deliberate_practice_in_the_acquistion_of_expert_performance"]}
