{"id":"301298911_Teachers'_Perceptions_and_Practices_of_STEAM_Education_in_South_Korea","abstract":"This study examined teachers' perceptions and practices of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education in South Korea, drawing on a survey of teachers in STEAM model schools. Results showed that the majority of Korean teachers, especially experienced teachers and male teachers, had a positive view on the role of STEAM education. At the same time, Korean teachers highlighted various challenges in implementing STEAM education, such as finding time to carry out STEAM lessons, increased workloads, and lack of administrative and financial support. Our findings suggest that sufficient support from the government, the reconstruction of national curriculum, and significant changes in the national assessment system are needed to better promote STEAM education.","authors":["Hyunju Park","Soo-yong Byun","Jaeho Sim","Hyesook Han"],"meta":["July 2016Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 12(7):1739-1753","DOI:10.12973/eurasia.2016.1531a"],"references":["275582846_Shadow_Education_and_Academic_Success_in_Republic_of_Korea","270044982_The_Effects_of_STEAM-Based_Integrated_Subject_Study_on_Elementary_School_Students'_Creative_Personality","267233181_Infusing_Engineering_Design_into_High_School_STEM_Courses","316006203_Elementary_School_Students'_Images_of_Scientists_and_Engineers","306363737_Analysis_of_Elementary_School_Teachers'_Perception_on_Field_Application_of_STEAM_Education","292027200_An_investigation_of_science_technology_engineering_and_mathematics_STEM_focused_high_schools_in_the_US","286201625_A_preliminary_review_of_the_effects_of_a_summer_bridge_program_on_pre-college_STEM_majors","280762577_Analysis_of_Prospective_and_In-Service_Teachers'_Awareness_of_STEAM_Convergent_Education","279167121_Elementary_Pre-service_Teachers_and_In-service_Teachers'_Perceptions_and_Demands_on_STEAM_Education","266009985_Incorporating_Engineering_Design_Challenges_into_STEM_Courses"]}
