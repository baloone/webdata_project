{"id":"280858448_An_Efficient_Hybrid_Conjugate_Gradient_Method_with_the_Strong_Wolfe-Powell_Line_Search","abstract":"Conjugate gradient (CG) method is an interesting tool to solve optimization problems in many fields, such as design, economics, physics, and engineering. In this paper, we depict a new hybrid of CG method which relates to the famous Polak-Ribi`ere-Polyak (PRP) formula. It reveals a solution for the PRP case which is not globally convergent with the strong Wolfe-Powell (SWP) line search. The new formula possesses the sufficient descent condition and the global convergent properties. In addition, we further explained about the cases where PRP method failed with SWP line search. Furthermore, we provide numerical computations for\nthe new hybrid CG method which is almost better than other related PRP formulas in both the number of iterations and the CPU time under some standard test functions.","authors":["Ahmad Alhawarat","Mustafa Mamat","Mohd Rivaie","Zabidin Salleh"],"meta":["July 2015Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2015(Article ID 103517):7 pages","DOI:10.1155/2015/103517"],"references":["313181074_Functional_minimization_by_conjugate_gradients","313096736_Function_Minimization_by_Conjugate_Gradient","267183134_MVF_-Multivariate_Test_Functions_Library_in_C_for_Unconstrained_Global_Optimization","265681369_Nonlinear_programming_computational_methods","263102632_Chaos-order_transition_in_foraging_behavior_of_ants","261153091_New_modifications_of_conjugate_gradient_coefficient_with_global_convergence_properties","260115244_A_fuzzy_adaptive_chaotic_ant_swarm_optimization_for_economic_dispatch","260115174_Data_clustering_using_bacterial_foraging_optimization","260114994_Chaotic_ant_swarm_approach_for_data_clustering","257635836_Chaotic_ant_swarm_approach_for_data_clustering"]}
