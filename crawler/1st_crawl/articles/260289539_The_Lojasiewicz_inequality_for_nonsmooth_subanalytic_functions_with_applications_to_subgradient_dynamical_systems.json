{"id":"260289539_The_Lojasiewicz_inequality_for_nonsmooth_subanalytic_functions_with_applications_to_subgradient_dynamical_systems","abstract":"Given a real-analytic function f : IR n → IR and a critical point a ∈ IR n , the Lojasiewicz inequality asserts that there exists θ ∈ [ 1 2 , 1) such that the function |f −f (a)| θ −1 remains bounded around a. In this paper, we extend the above result to a wide class of non-smooth functions (that admit possibly the value +∞), by establishing an analogous inequality in which the derivative ∇f (x) can be replaced by any element x * of the subdifferential ∂f (x) of f . Like its smooth version, this result provides new insights into the convergence aspects of subgradient-type dynamical systems. Provided that the function f is sufficiently regular (for instance, convex or lower-C 2), the bounded trajectories of the corresponding subgradient dy-namical system can be shown to be of finite length. Explicit estimates of the ratio of convergence are also derived.","authors":["Jérôme Bolte","Aris Daniilidis","Adrian S.
