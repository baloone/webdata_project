{"id":"260398837_Industrial_Applications_of_the_Kalman_Filter_A_Review","abstract":"The Kalman filter (KF) has received a huge interest from the industrial electronics community and has played a key role in many engineering fields since the 1970s, ranging, without being exhaustive, trajectory estimation, state and parameter esti-mation for control or diagnosis, data merging, signal processing, and so on. This paper provides a brief overview of the industrial applications and implementation issues of the KF in six topics of the industrial electronics community, highlighting some relevant reference papers and giving future research trends.","authors":["Francois Auger","Mickael Hilairet","Josep M.
