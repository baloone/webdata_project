{"id":"232252796_Reputation_Aggregation_in_Peer-to-Peer_Network_Using_Differential_Gossip_Algorithm","abstract":"Reputation aggregation in peer to peer networks is generally a very time and\nresource consuming process. Moreover, most of the methods consider that\nreputation of a node is same for every other node in the network, while this is\nnot true. This paper proposes a reputation aggregation algorithm that uses a\nvariant of gossip algorithm called differential gossip. Differential gossip is\nfast and it requires less amount of resources. This mechanism allows\ncomputation of different reputation value of a node for every other node in the\nnetwork. We have implemented Differential Gossip Trust for power law network\nformed using preferential attachment \\emph{(PA)} Model. The reputation computed\nusing differential gossip trust shows good immunity to collusion. We have\nverified the performance of the algorithm on power law networks of different\nsizes ranging from 100 nodes to 50,000 nodes.","authors":["Ruchir Gupta","Yatindra Singh"],"meta":["April 2015IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2015.2427793","SourcearXiv","Project: Reputation Management System in Peer-to-Peer Networks"],"references":["236118860_Trust_Estimation_in_Peer-to-Peer_Network_Using_BLUE","224762520_Reputation-Based_Resource_Allocation_in_P2P_Systems_of_Rational_Users","224710792_Ranking-Based_Optimal_Resource_Allocation_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","224393202_Free_Riding_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","224245046_A_fuzzy_approach_for_reputation_management_in_Bittorrent_P2P_network","260357584_PowerTrust_A_Robust_and_Scalable_Reputation_System_for_Trusted_Peer-to-Peer_Computing","242624905_Fundamentals_of_Statistical_Signal_Processing_Vol_II_Detection_Theory","230770803_An_Introduction_to_Game_Theory","224243255_A_temporal_view_of_the_topology_of_dynamic_Bittorrent_swarms","222652814_Reputation-based_policies_that_provide_the_right_incentives_in_peer-to-peer_environments","221455016_Reciprocal_resource_sharing_in_P2P_environments","221932998_Fundamentals_of_Statistical_Signal_Processing_Estimation_Theory","221932953_Randomized_gossip_algorithms","221433840_A_Point-Based_Inventive_System_to_Prevent_Free-Riding_on_P2P_Network_Environments","221181544_PET_A_PErsonalized_Trust_Model_with_Reputation_and_Risk_Evaluation_for_P2P_Resource_Sharing"]}
