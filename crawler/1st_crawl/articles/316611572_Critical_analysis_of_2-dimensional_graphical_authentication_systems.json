{"id":"316611572_Critical_analysis_of_2-dimensional_graphical_authentication_systems","abstract":"The existing recall based graphical schemes under Knowledge based authentication provide the scope to overcome the observed shortcomings of image selection, hotspot problem, password creation time, login time and usability in Pass Point (PP), Cued Click Point (CCP) and Persuasive Cued Click Point (PCCP). A framework for an initial lab study based on several modification with respect to the latest graphical scheme i.e. PCCP is proposed. The initial lab study consists of two sets of images viz., the public domain images used by previous research studies and the other set of private domain images selected by the users. The aspects of success rate, password entry time and hotspot coverage, are calculated for the two sets. In addition the randomness, password space and password entropy are also analyzed. The first objective is to identify the internal consistency of the two sets of images with respect to the above stated aspects. Secondly to compare these two sets with the latest graphical password scheme(s). The comparative results indicate a scope to develop a new graphical password scheme.","authors":["Priti C.
