{"id":"7022590_Machine_learning_in_bioinformatics","abstract":"This article reviews machine learning methods for bioinformatics. It presents modelling methods, such as supervised classification, clustering and probabilistic graphical models for knowledge discovery, as well as deterministic and stochastic heuristics for optimization. Applications in genomics, proteomics, systems biology, evolution and text mining are also shown.","authors":["Pedro Larranaga","Borja Calvo","Roberto Santana","Concha Bielza"],"meta":["April 2006Briefings in Bioinformatics 7(1):86-112","SourcePubMed"],"references":["314462036_Prediction_of_cancer_outcome_with_microarrays_a_multiple_random_validation_strategy","264970335_Data_Mining_in_Bioinformatics","344777896_Current_Topics_in_Computational_Molecular_Biology","332455282_Classification_Methodology_for_Bioinformatics_Data_Analysis","324428282_Discriminant_Analysis_and_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition","322715582_The_elements_of_statistical_learning","319253793_Computational_Modeling_of_Genetic_and_Biochemical_Networks","314318887_CAUSALITY_MODELS_REASONING_AND_INFERENCE","313630463_The_co-evolution_of_memetic_algorithms_for_protein_structure_prediction","313007741_An_algorithm_for_vector_quantizer_design","312942401_Combined_5x2cv_F-Test_for_Comparing_Supervised_Classification_Learning_Algorithms","311672812_Is_cross-validation_valid_for_small-sample_microarray_classification","308059469_Cross-Validatory_Choice_and_Assessment_of_Statistical_Predictions","291529193_Identification_of_Coding_Regions_in_DNA_Sequences_Using_Evolved_Neural_Networks","291040004_Toward_Effective_Polypeptide_Structure_Prediction_with_Parallel_Fast_Messy_Genetic_Algorithms","290501871_Evolutionary_Computation_and_Fractal_Visualization_of_Sequence_Data","290075383_Biological_Sequence_Assembly_and_Alignment","288906520_Random_forests","287674453_Prediction_of_protein_subcellular_location_using_fuzzy_k-NN_method","287180824_Bayesian_Networks_and_Decision_Graphs","281395538_Evolutionary_computation_for_the_inference_of_natural_evolutionary_histories","281266055_No_Free_Lunch_Theorems_for_Optimization","279434128_Clustering_Microarray_Data_with_Evolutionary_Algorithms","279368025_Vector_Quantization_and_Signal_Compression","278695382_The_Nature_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","278362147_Data_mining_in_bioinformatics","268292063_Computational_Molecular_Biology_An_Algorithmic_Approach","267446419_Editorial_Recent_developments_in_mixture_models_Hamburg_July_2001","266862796_Query-driven_biclustering_of_microarray_data_by_Gibbs_sampling","266310934_Motoda_H_Feature_Selection_for_Knowledge_Discovery_and_Data_Mining_Kluwer_Academic_USA","266041543_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition_Third_Edition","262346894_Edge_Exclusion_Tests_for_Graphical_Gaussian_Models","260673067_An_Algorithm_for_Vector_Quantizer_Design","258762458_Probabilistic_Modeling_in_Bioinformatics_and_Medical_Informatics","254198346_Learning_Bayesian_Network_Structures_by_searching_the_best_orderordering_with_genetic_algorithms","253512881_Discriminant_analysis_and_statistical_pattern_recognition_2nd_printing","250901095_Using_Bayesian_Networks_for_Estimating_Gene_Networks_from_Microarrays_and_Biological_Knowledge","248848344_Pattern_Classification_and_Scene_Analysis","248596631_Feature_Set_Search_Algorithms","248055450_The_use_of_Measurements_in_Taxonomic_Problems","246366900_Hidden_Markov_models_in_computational_biology_Applications_to_protein_modeling","246175764_Feature_set_search_algorithms_in_Pattern_Recognition_and_Signal_Processing","245675017_Cluster_analysis_of_multivariate_data_eIciency_versus_interpretability_of_classi7cations","244487519_Pattern_Recognition_and_Reduction_of_Dimensionality","243763580_The_Nature_Of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","243708220_Cross-Validatory_Choice_and_Assessment_of_Statistical_Predictions_With_Discussion","243679109_Estimating_the_Error_Rate_of_a_Prediction_Rule_Improvement_on_Cross-Validation","243048828_Logistic_regression_analysis_of_epidemiologic_data_Theory_and_practice","242575516_Conditional_Independence_in_Statistical_Theory","242359778_Steps_toward_artificial_intelligence","238085345_FUTURE_PATHS_FOR_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING_AND_LINKS_TO_AR_TIFI_CIAL_INTELLI_G_EN_CE","242358078_The_Elements_Of_Statistical_Learning","239066731_Genetic_Programming_On_the_Programming_of_Computers_by_Means_of_Natural_Selection","239056767_Discriminatory_Analysis_Nonparametric_Discrimination_Consistency_Properties","238454522_Text_Mining_for_Biology_And_Biomedicine"]}
