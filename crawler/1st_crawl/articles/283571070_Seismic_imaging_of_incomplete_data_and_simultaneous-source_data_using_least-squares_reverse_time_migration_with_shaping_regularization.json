{"id":"283571070_Seismic_imaging_of_incomplete_data_and_simultaneous-source_data_using_least-squares_reverse_time_migration_with_shaping_regularization","abstract":"Simultaneous-source acquisition improves the efficiency\nof the seismic data acquisition process. However, direct im-\naging of simultaneous-source data may introduce crosstalk\nartifacts in the final image. Likewise, direct imaging of in-\ncomplete data avoids the step of data reconstruction, but it\ncan suffer from migration artifacts. We have proposed to in-\ncorporate shaping regularization into least-squares reverse\ntime migration (LSRTM) and use it for suppressing interfer-\nence noise caused by simultaneous-source data or migration\nartifacts caused by incomplete data. To implement LSRTM,\nwe have applied lowrank one-step reverse time migration\nand its adjoint iteratively in the conjugate-gradient algorithm\nto minimize the data misfit. A shaping operator imposing\nstructure constraints on the estimated model was applied\nat each iteration. We constructed the shaping operator as\na structure-enhancing filtering to attenuate migration arti-\nfacts and crosstalk noise while preserving structural infor-\nmation. We have carried out numerical tests on synthetic\nmodels in which the proposed method exhibited a fast con-\nvergence rate and was effective in attenuating migration ar-\ntifacts and crosstalk noise.","authors":["Zhiguang Xue","Yangkang Chen","Sergey Fomel","Junzhe Sun"],"meta":["January 2016Geophysics 81(1):S11-S20","DOI:10.1190/GEO2014-0524.1","Projects: Reproducible researchSimultaneous source acquisition"],"references":["299907308_Accelerating_Extended_Least_Squares_Migration_with_Weighted_Conjugate_Gradient_Iteration","281062722_Making_the_most_out_of_the_least_squares_migration","271490896_A_stable_and_practical_implementation_of_least-squares_reverse_time_migration","266526677_Least-squares_Migration_of_Simultaneous_Sources_Data_with_a_Deblurring_Filter","265383699_Iterative_deblending_of_simultaneous-source_seismic_data_using_seislet-domain_shaping_regularization","249868514_A_new_look_at_marine_simultaneous_sources","247935196_Predictive_painting_of_3D_seismic_volumes","237981593_Time-shift_imaging_condition_in_seismic_migration","228810410_Adaptive_multiple_subtraction_using_regularized_nonstationary_regression","228785124_Least-squares_migration_of_incomplete_reection_data","228763563_Applications_of_Plane-Wave_Destructor_Filters","228566851_Shaping_regularization_in_geophysical-estimation_problems","228402541_Angle-domain_common-image_gathers_by_wavefield_continuation_methods","228362255_High-resolution_wave-equation_AVA_imaging_Algorithm_and_tests_with_a_data_set_from_the_Western_Canadian_Sedimentary_Basin","303406126_Accelerating_extended_least-squares_migration_with_weighted_conjugate_gradient_iteration","301397852_Least-squares_reverse-time_migration_using_one-step_two-way_wave_extrapolation_by_non-stationary_phase_shift","300149270_Least_Squares_Wave_Equation_Migration_of_Elastic_Data","299908534_Seismic_data_interpolation_using_plane-wave_shaping_regularization","299906828_Double_Plane_Wave_Least_Squares_Reverse_Time_Migration","299906765_Full_waveform_inversion_with_sparsity_constraint_in_seislet_domain","299905790_Preconditioning_least-squares_RTM_in_viscoacoustic_media_by_Q_-compensated_RTM","284763175_Low-rank_one-step_wave_extrapolation_for_reverse_time_migration","279969997_Changing_the_mindset_in_seismic_acquisition","269067982_Least-squares_migrationinversion_of_blended_data","269067069_Subsalt_event_regularization_with_steering_filters","269042294_Multisource_least-squares_extended_reverse_time_migration_with_preconditioning_guided_gradient_method","266636487_High_Fidelity_Imaging_with_Least_Squares_Migration","263720796_3D_Multi-source_Least-squares_Reverse_Time_Migration","255666482_Least-squares_migration_of_incomplete_data_sets_with_regularization_in_the_subsurface-offset_domain","253610939_Kirchhoff_modeling_inversion_for_reflectivity_and_subsurface_illumination","252537897_Least-square_wave-equation_migration_for_AVPAVA_inversion","249868515_Acquisition_Using_Simultaneous_Sources","249865486_Least-squares_DMO_and_migration","249865479_Phase_encoding_of_shot_records_in_prestack_migration","249857990_Subsalt_multiple_attenuation_and_imaging_Observations_from_the_Sigsbee2B_synthetic_dataset","243477730_Earth_Soundings_Analysis_Processing_Versus_Inversion","238706208_Regularized_least-squares_inversion_for_3-D_subsalt_imaging","228902731_Angle-domain_common-image_gathers_for_migration_velocity_analysis_by_wavefield-continuation_imaging","227718783_Nonlinear_structure-enhancing_filtering_using_plane-wave_prediction","51992143_Methods_of_Conjugate_Gradients_for_Solving_Linear_Systems"]}
