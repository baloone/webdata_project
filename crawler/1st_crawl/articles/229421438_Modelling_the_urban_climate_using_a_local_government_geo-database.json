{"id":"229421438_Modelling_the_urban_climate_using_a_local_government_geo-database","abstract":"In this study, local government digital spatial data are used to describe urban geometry and analyse spatial variations of the urban climate within the central areas of Goteborg, Sweden. A high-resolution raster digital elevation model (1 m pixel resolution) consisting of building structures and ground heights is derived from a local government geo-database, as well as land use patterns and artificial heat sources. Parameters such as the sky view factor (SVF) and daily averages of solar radiation are calculated. Results obtained from the model are compared with intra-urban air temperature variations which are derived from mobile measurements, as well as surface temperature variations derived from thermal infrared images. Results show that high-resolution digital elevation models in raster format are very useful sources of data for the investigation of intra-urban temperature variations. Results also show that the areal mean of SVF correlates with intra-urban air temperature variations to a higher degree than SVF that is taken from a point source location. The correlation between the modelled SVF and surface temperature is high during both spring and winter. Adding information about daily averages of global radiation for the spring measurement causes the correlation between SVF and surface temperature variations to increase.
