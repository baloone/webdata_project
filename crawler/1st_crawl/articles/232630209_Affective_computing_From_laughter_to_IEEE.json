{"id":"232630209_Affective_computing_From_laughter_to_IEEE","abstract":"This is an invited introduction to the first issue of the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, telling personal stories and sharing viewpoints of a pioneer and visionary of the field of Affective Computing. This article is not intended to be a thorough or a historical account of the development of the field, for the author is not a historian and cannot begin to properly credit the extraordinary efforts of hundreds of people who helped to cultivate and expand the rich and fertile landscape that extends before us now.","authors":["Rosalind W Picard"],"meta":["January 2010IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing 1(1):11-17","DOI:10.1109/T-AFFC.2010.10"],"references":["236634895_Affecting_CorporaExperiments_with_Automatic_Affect_Annotation_System_-_A_Case_Study_of_the_2channel_Forum_-","235361517_A_Circumplex_Model_of_Affect","228763223_Towards_Fully_Automatic_Emoticon_Analysis_System_o","224159444_CAO_A_Fully_Automatic_Emoticon_Analysis_System_Based_on_Theory_of_Kinesics","221247215_Affect_Intensity_Analysis_of_Dark_Web_Forums","220817026_Chunking_with_Support_Vector_Machines","220813465_Towards_Context_Aware_Emotional_Intelligence_in_Machines_Computing_Contextual_Appropriateness_of_Affective_States","240713511_ABSTRACT_Extraction_and_Classification_of_Facemarks_with_Kernel_Methods","238347264_The_Passions_Emotions_and_the_Meaning_of_Life","234273497_POC_caster_Broadcasting_Agent_Using_Conversational_Representation_for_Internet_Community","228815250_Emotional_Expression_Online_Gender_Differences_in_Emoticon_Use","223400111_Emoticons_and_Social_Interaction_on_the_Internet_The_Importance_of_Social_Context","222687913_A_Linguistic_Analysis_of_Chat_Reference_Conversations_with_18-24_Year-Old_College_Students","221608232_Extraction_and_classification_of_facemarks","221019648_Express_Emoticons_Choice_Method_for_Smooth_Communication_of_e-Business","220873738_Building_Emotion_Lexicon_from_Weblog_Corpora","4285010_Classification_of_Facemarks_Using_N-gram","4060446_Learning_face_marks_for_natural_language_dialogue_systems"]}
