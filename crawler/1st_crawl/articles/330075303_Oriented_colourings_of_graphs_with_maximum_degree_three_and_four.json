{"id":"330075303_Oriented_colourings_of_graphs_with_maximum_degree_three_and_four","abstract":"We show that any orientation of a graph with maximum degree three has an oriented 9-colouring, and that any orientation of a graph with maximum degree four has an oriented 69-colouring. These results improve the best known upper bounds of 11 and 80, respectively.","authors":["Christopher Duffy","Gary MacGillivray","Eric Sopena"],"meta":["April 2019Discrete Mathematics 342(4):959-974","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2018.10.008"],"references":["280046697_Analogous_to_cliques_of_mn-colored_mixed_graphs","276107065_Homomorphisms_and_colourings_of_oriented_graphs_An_updated_survey","266708862_Analogs_of_cliques_for_oriented_coloring","229796797_The_Chromatic_Number_of_Oriented_Graphs","281597120_A_contribution_to_the_theory_of_graph_homomorphisms_and_colorings","268311969_The_search_for_N-ec_Graphs","264955125_A_Constructive_Solution_to_a_Tournament_Problem","259089804_The_oriented_chromatic_number_of_Halin_graphs","229675173_Paley_graphs_satisfy_all_first-order_adjacency_axioms","225649291_Acyclic_Colorings_of_Planar_Graphs"]}
