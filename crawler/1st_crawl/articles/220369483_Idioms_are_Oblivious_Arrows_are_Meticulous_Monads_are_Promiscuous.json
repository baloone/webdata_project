{"id":"220369483_Idioms_are_Oblivious_Arrows_are_Meticulous_Monads_are_Promiscuous","abstract":"We revisit the connection between three notions of computation: Moggiʼs monads, Hughesʼs arrows and McBride and Patersonʼs idioms (also called applicative functors). We show that idioms are equivalent to arrows that satisfy the type isomorphism A↝B≃1↝(A→B) and that monads are equivalent to arrows that satisfy the type isomorphism A↝B≃A→(1↝B). Further, idioms embed into arrows and arrows embed into monads.","authors":["Sam Lindley","Philip Wadler","Jeremy Yallop"],"meta":["March 2011Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 229(5):97-117","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2011.02.018","SourceDBLP"],"references":["277298859_Arrows_and_computation","221303508_Programming_with_Arrows","221241210_A_New_Notation_for_Arrows","215446169_Applicative_Programming_with_Effects","265354140_Categories_for_the_working_mathematician_2nd_ed","222520426_Generalising_monads_to_arrows","220676887_The_arrow_calculus","50332962_Categories_for_Working_Mathematicians","3501195_Computational_lambda-calculus_and_monads","2593171_Notions_of_Computation_and_Monads"]}
