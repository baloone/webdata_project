{"id":"326521693_Extreme_Deep_Learning_in_Biosecurity_The_case_of_machine_hearing_for_marine_species_identification","abstract":"Biosafety is defined as a set of preventive measures aimed at reducing the risk of infectious diseases’ spread to crops and animals, by providing quarantine pesticides. Prolonged and sustained overheating of the sea, creates significant habitat losses, resulting in the proliferation and spread of invasive species, which invade foreign areas typically seeking colder climate. This is one of the most important modern threats to marine biosafety. The research effort presented herein, proposes an innovative approach for Marine Species Identification, by employing an advanced intelligent Machine Hearing Framework (MHF). The target is the identification of invasive alien species (IAS), based on the sounds they produce. This classification attempt, can provide significant aid towards the protection of biodiversity, and can achieve overall regional biosecurity. Hearing recognition is performed by using the Online Sequential Multilayer Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder (MIGRATE_ELM). The MIGRATE_ELM uses an innovative Deep Learning algorithm (DELE) that is applied for the first time for the above purpose. The assignment of the corresponding class “native” or “invasive” in its locality, is carried out by an equally innovative approach entitled “Geo Location Country Based Service” that has been proposed by our research team.","authors":["Konstantinos Demertzis","Lazaros S.
