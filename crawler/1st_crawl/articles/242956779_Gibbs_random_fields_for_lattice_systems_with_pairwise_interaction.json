Appl. 2, 302–312 (1968); translation from Funkts. Anal. Prilozh. 2, No. 4, 44–57 (1968; Zbl 0192.61702), Funct. Anal. Appl. 3, 22–28 (1969); translation from Funkts. Anal. Prilozh. 3, No. 1, 27–35 (1969; Zbl 0192.61801)], is to develop a point of view on problems of classical statistical physics in which a system is considered to be included in an “infinite container” rather than in a finite container of large volume, as is ordinarily done. An analogous point of view was developed by R. A. Minlos [Funct. Anal. Appl. 1, 140–150 (1967); translation from Funkts. Anal. Prilozh. 1, No. 2, 60–73 (1967; Zbl 0245.60080), Funct. Anal. Appl. 1, 206–217 (1967); translation from Funkts. Anal. Prilozh. 1, No. 3, 40–53 (1967; Zbl 0245.60081)] and D. Ruelle [Commun. Math. Phys. 5, 324–329 (1967; Zbl 0154.46502)] but, in these works, another approach was adopted, related to the concept of a Gibbsian random field which we introduce here. It is based on more general results of the author on the specification of random fields by conditional distributions.","authors":["R. L.
