{"id":"355200495_On_the_statistical_significance_of_communities_from_weighted_graphs","abstract":"Community detection is a fundamental procedure in the analysis of network data. Despite decades of research, there is still no consensus on the definition of a community. To analytically test the realness of a candidate community in weighted networks, we present a general formulation from a significance testing perspective. In this new formulation, the edge-weight is modeled as a censored observation due to the noisy characteristics of real networks. In particular, the edge-weights of missing links are incorporated as well, which are specified to be zeros based on the assumption that they are truncated or unobserved. Thereafter, the community significance assessment issue is formulated as a two-sample test problem on censored data. More precisely, the Logrank test is employed to conduct the significance testing on two sets of augmented edge-weights: internal weight set and external weight set. The presented approach is evaluated on both weighted networks and un-weighted networks. The experimental results show that our method can outperform prior widely used evaluation metrics on the task of individual community validation.","authors":["Zengyou He","Wenfang Chen","Xiaoqi Wei","Yan Liu"],"meta":["October 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):20304","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-99175-2"],"references":["339965626_Computing_exact_P-values_for_community_detection","337761591_Computing_the_statistical_significance_of_optimized_communities_in_networks","323702309_Network_structure_from_rich_but_noisy_data","321186679_Community_detection_algorithm_evaluation_with_ground-truth_data","263012336_On_the_Permanence_of_Vertices_in_Network_Communities","261065917_Scalable_detection_of_statistically_significant_communities_and_hierarchies_message-passing_for_modularity","344547297_Significance-based_community_detection_in_weighted_networks","343592901_Detecting_Statistically_Significant_Communities","338373708_Community_structure_A_comparative_evaluation_of_community_detection_methods","301876570_Metrics_for_Community_Analysis_A_Survey","255173726_A_testing_based_extraction_algorithm_for_identifying_significant_communities_in_networks","248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","246901566_Multiple_Comparisons_Among_Means","244443581_Survival_Analysis_Techniques_For_Censored_And_Truncated_Data","228766359_The_Political_Blogosphere_and_the_2004_US_Election_Divided_They_Blog"]}
