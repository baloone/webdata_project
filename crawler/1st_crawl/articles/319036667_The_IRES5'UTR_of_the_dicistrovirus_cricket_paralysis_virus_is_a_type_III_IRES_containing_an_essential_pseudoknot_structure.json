{"id":"319036667_The_IRES5'UTR_of_the_dicistrovirus_cricket_paralysis_virus_is_a_type_III_IRES_containing_an_essential_pseudoknot_structure","abstract":"Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) is a dicistrovirus. Its positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome contains\ntwo internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs). The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) IRES5'UTR mediates translation of non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1 whereas the well-known intergenic region (IGR) IRESIGR is required for translation of structural proteins from open reading frame 2 in the late phase of infection. Concerted action of both IRES is essential for host translation shut-off and viral translation. IRESIGR has been extensively studied, in contrast the IRES5'UTR remains largely unexplored. Here, we define the minimal IRES element required for\nefficient translation initiation in drosophila S2 cellfree extracts. We show that IRES5'UTR promotes direct\nrecruitment of the ribosome on the cognate viral AUG start codon without any scanning step, using\na Hepatitis-C virus-related translation initiation mechanism. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed\nthat IRES5'UTR recruits eukaryotic initiation factor 3, confirming that it belongs to type III class of IRES\nelements. Using Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and DMS probing, we established\na secondary structure model of 5'UTR and of the minimal IRES5'UTR. The IRES5'UTR contains a pseudoknot structure that is essential for proper folding and ribosome recruitment. Overall, our results pave the way for studies addressing the synergy and interplay between the two IRES from CrPV.","authors":["Lauriane Gross","Quentin Vicens","Evelyne Einhorn","Audrey Noireterre"],"meta":["July 2017Nucleic Acids Research 45(15):8993â€“9004","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkx622","Project: IRES Project"],"references":["294424101_Initiation_on_the_divergent_Type_I_cadicivirus_IRES_factor_requirements_and_interactions_with_the_translation_apparatus","291347280_Temporal_Regulation_of_Distinct_Internal_Ribosome_Entry_Sites_of_the_Dicistroviridae_Cricket_Paralysis_Virus","291187434_Attachment_of_ribosomal_complexes_and_retrograde_scanning_during_initiation_on_the_Halastavi_arva_virus_IRES","271222154_Cryo-EM_of_Ribosomal_80S_Complexes_with_Termination_Factors_Reveals_the_Translocated_Cricket_Paralysis_Virus_IRES","268518719_RACK1_controls_IRES-mediated_translation_of_viruses","277144635_Structural_insights_into_viral_IRES-dependent_translation_mechanisms","276421535_The_5'_Untranslated_Region_of_a_Novel_Infectious_Molecular_Clone_of_the_Dicistrovirus_Cricket_Paralysis_Virus_Modulates_Infection","275414120_Purification_of_mRNA-programmed_translation_initiation_complexes_suitable_for_mass_spectrometry_analysis","272097025_Structure_of_a_yeast_40S-eIF1-eIF1A-eIF3-eIF3j_initiation_complex","266029010_Human_Eukaryotic_Initiation_Factor_2_eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi_Ternary_Complex_and_eIF3_Stabilize_the_43_S_Preinitiation_Complex","262051714_Initiation_of_Translation_by_Cricket_Paralysis_Virus_IRES_Requires_Its_Translocation_in_the_Ribosome","258252760_Hepatitis-C-virus-like_internal_ribosome_entry_sites_displace_eIF3_to_gain_access_to_the_40S_subunit","235437616_High-resolution_cryo-electron_microscopy_structure_of_the_Trypanosoma_brucei_ribosome","265557937_Structural_basis_for_the_inhibition_of_the_eukaryotic_ribosome","236056372_Accurate_SHAPE-directed_RNA_secondary_structure_modeling_including_pseudoknots"]}
