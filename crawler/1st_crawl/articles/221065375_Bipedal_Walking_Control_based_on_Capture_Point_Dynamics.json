{"id":"221065375_Bipedal_Walking_Control_based_on_Capture_Point_Dynamics","abstract":"This paper builds up on the Capture Point concept and exploits the simple form of the dynamical equations of the\nLinear Inverted Pendulum model when formulated in terms\nof the center of mass and the Capture Point. The presented\nmethods include (i) the derivation of a Capture Point (CP)\ncontrol principle based on the natural dynamics of the linear\ninverted pendulum (LIP), which stabilizes the walking robot\nand motivates (ii) the design of a CP tracking and a CP endof-\nstep controller. The exponential stability of the CP control\nlaw is proven. Tilting is avoided by proper projection of the\ncommanded zero moment point. The robustness of the derived control algorithms is analyzed analytically and verified in simulation and experiments.","authors":["Johannes Englsberger","Christian Ott","Maximo A.
