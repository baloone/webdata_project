{"id":"311918792_An_Emotion-based_Model_for_Improving_Students'_Engagement_using_Agent-based_Social_Simulator","abstract":"Students' emotional engagement in classrooms has always been regarded as a crucial factor influencing educational outcomes. Emotionally engaged students are highly motivated to attend classes and participate actively in discussions. Conversely, emotionally disengaged students are habitual truants and/or often misbehave in classrooms. It is time-consuming to conduct research using traditional methods such as data collection or questionnaire. Furthermore, as these experiments are conducted on humans, limited settings can be organized and difficult to control/monitor. Therefore, in this paper, we present our work-in-progress to address the problem. We propose a conceptual emotion-based model that is animated by an agent-based social simulator. We also propose an algorithmic approach that decides whether to maintain or update a proposed action plan for improving students' engagement in a classroom. The rudimentary theory of this proposal is based on three main elements: the engagement level of students, the emotional state of a lecturer and the emotional state of students in a classroom.","authors":["Latha Subramainan","Moamin A Mahmoud","Mohd Sharifuddin Ahmad","Mohd Zaliman Mohd Yusoff"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering and Information Technology 6(6):952","DOI:10.18517/ijaseit.6.6.1300"],"references":["322342119_Student_Engagement_Literature_Review","289271981_Student_engagement_as_a_function_of_environmental_complexity_in_high_school_classrooms","284205394_A_Survey_of_Agent_Platforms","279210327_Teaching_This_Class_Drives_Me_Nuts_-_Examining_the_Person_and_Context_Specificity_of_Teacher_Emotions","264628384_A_Review_of_Norms_and_Normative_Multiagent_Systems","259137993_The_power_of_anticipated_feedback_Effects_on_students'_achievement_goals_and_achievement_emotions","228502492_Engagement_and_Disaffection_in_the_Classroom_Part_of_a_Larger_Motivational_Dynamic","221528796_Agent-based_modeling_and_simulation_ABMS_examples","42363764_Antecedents_and_Effects_of_Teachers'_Emotional_Experiences_An_Integrated_Perspective_and_Empirical_Test","30015845_Between-_and_Within-Domain_Relations_of_Students'_Academic_Emotions","5140320_Agent_Based_Social_Simulation_a_Computer_Science_View","3911056_An_Affective_Model_of_Interplay_Between_Emotions_and_Learning_Reengineering_Educational_Pedagogy-Building_a_Learning_Companion","309092254_A_Norm_Assimilation_Approach_for_Multi-agent_Systems_in_Heterogeneous_Communities","308731167_Introductory_tutorial_Agent-based_modeling_and_simulation","304293686_A_classification_of_emotions_study_in_software_agent_and_robotics_applications_research","291997250_The_Role_of_Emotional_Engagement_in_Lecturer-Student_Interaction_and_the_Impact_on_Academic_Outcomes_of_Student_Achievement_and_Learning","290672230_Norms_Detection_and_Assimilation_in_Multi-agent_Systems_A_Conceptual_Approach","289584583_Dropping_out_of_high_school_The_role_of_parent_and_teacher_self-determination_support_reciprocal_friendships_and_academic_motivation","279124318_Obligation_and_Prohibition_Norms_Mining_Algorithm_for_Normative_Multi-agent_Systems","271497820_A_norms_mining_approach_to_norms_detection_in_multi-agent_systems","271497819_A_multi-agent_framework_for_dynamic_task_assignment_and_delegation_in_task_distribution","249797781_School_Engagement_Potential_of_the_Concept_State_of_the_Evidence","247512787_Stress_in_Teaching_A_study_of_occupational_stress_and_its_determinants_job_satisfaction_and_career_commitment_among_primary_schoolteachers","241105992_Students'_emotions_during_homework_Structures_self-concept_antecedents_and_achievement_outcomes","237330215_Understanding_and_promoting_student_engagement_in_university_learning_communities","229357532_Impact_of_teacher_competencies_on_student_emotions_A_multi-method_approach","229271743_Pekrun_R_Students'_Emotions_and_Academic_Engagement_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue_Contemporary_Educational_Psychology_36_1-3","225610891_The_Control-Value_Theory_of_Achievement_Emotions_Assumptions_Corollaries_and_Implications_for_Educational_Research_and_Practice","222579386_Multi-Agent_Simulations_and_Ecosystem_Management_A_Review","220906425_Modeling_Agent-Based_Collaborative_Process","45491017_Institutional_seriousness_concerning_Black_male_student_engagement_Necessary_conditions_and_collaborative_partnerships","2891896_Simulating_Organizational_Decision-Making_Using_a_Cognitively_Realistic_Agent_Model"]}
