{"id":"258792942_A_Successful_Experience_of_ABET_Accreditation_of_an_Electrical_Engineering_Program","abstract":"The procedures followed and the various factors that led to the ABET accreditation of the College of Engineering, Qassim University, Buraidah, Saudi Arabia, are illustrated and evaluated for the benefit of other similar colleges. Taking the Electrical Engineering (EE) program as an example, this paper describes the procedures followed to implement a system that ensured a high-quality EE program and eventually led to ABET accreditation. It explains the preparations undertaken by the Department of Electrical Engineering in establishing and evaluating objectives and outcomes for the EE program through a well-designed continuous improvement process and applying these evaluation results to develop the program.","authors":["Sulaiman A.
