{"id":"222460028_Artificial_Intelligence_--_A_Personal_View","abstract":"The goal of Artificial Intelligence is to identify and solve tractable information processing problems. In so doing, two types of theory arise. Here, they are labelled Types 1 and 2, and their characteristics are outlined. This discussion creates a more than usually rigorous perspective of the subject, from which past work and future prospects are briefly reviewed.","authors":["David Marr"],"meta":["August 1977Artificial Intelligence 9(1):37-48","DOI:10.1016/0004-3702(77)90013-3","SourceOAI"],"references":["22361583_Visual_control_of_orientation_behavior_in_the_fly_Part_II_Towards_the_underlying_neural_interactions","22185446_Cooperative_Computation_of_Stereo_Disparity","21987276_Computer_simulation_of_protein_folding","21907328_On_Visual_Detection_of_Light_Sources","288467124_A_program_for_the_solution_of_a_class_of_geometric-analogy_intelligence-test_questions_Technical_report_DTIC_document_1964_also_appeared_in_1968","246049244_ELIZA_a_computer_program_for_the_study_of_natural_language_communication_between_men_and_machines","243677825_Identification_of_Conceptualisations_Underlying_Natural_Language","243549378_SIR_A_Computer_Program_for_Semantic_Information_Retrieval","242530158_Relaxation_labelling_and_the_reduction_of_local_ambiquities","242430108_Aspects_of_The_Theory_of_Syntax","240399348_Visual_control_of_the_olientafion_behaviour_of_the_fly_towards_the_underlying_neural_interactions","238681271_A_Framework_for_Representing_Knowledge_The_Psychology_of_Computer_Vision_Patrick_Winston","236025147_SIR_Semantic_Information_Retrieval","234816199_MACSYMA_-_the_fifth_year","229099884_An_Algorithm_for_the_Machine_Calculation_of_Complex_Fourier_Series","223714484_Understanding_Natural_Language","220431272_A_Heuristic_Program_that_Solves_Symbolic_Integration_Problems_in_Freshman_Calculus","220421826_Wiezenbaum_J_ELIZA_-_A_computer_Program_For_the_Study_of_Natural_Language_Communication_Between_Man_and_Machine_Communications_of_the_ACM_91_36-45","215458980_An_Algorithm_for_the_Machine_Computation_of_Complex_Fourier_Series","202165671_Explorations_in_Cognition","37597091_Analysis_of_Occluding_Contour","37596667_A_Note_on_the_Computation_of_Binocular_Disparity_in_a_Symbolic_Low-Level_Visual_Processor","30876038_Understanding_Line_Drawings_Of_Scenes_With_Shadows","30873079_A_Framework_for_Representing_Knowledge","23119944_Early_Processing_of_Visual_Information","23109858_Representation_and_Recognition_of_the_Spatial_Organization_of_Three-Dimensional_Shapes","22041941_Experiments_in_the_Visual_Perception_of_Texture","21957273_Selective_impairment_of_semantic_memory","7188419_On_Computing_the_Discrete_Fourier_Transform","3184673_Heuristic_Techniques_in_Computer_Aided_Circuit_Analysis"]}
