{"id":"253949610_Electronic_properties_of_carbon_toroids","abstract":"In a recent Scientific Correspondence, Liu et al. reported observing\ncarbon toroids. They suggested that these objects could be considered as\nquantum wires and that they would exhibit interesting transport\nproperties. Here I provide theoretical support for this proposition.","authors":["R. C.
