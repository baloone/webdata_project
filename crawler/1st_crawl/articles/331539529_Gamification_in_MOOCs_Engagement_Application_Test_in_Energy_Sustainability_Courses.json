{"id":"331539529_Gamification_in_MOOCs_Engagement_Application_Test_in_Energy_Sustainability_Courses","abstract":"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have triggered a sudden change in the educational scene. Its characteristics of being free, heterogeneous, multi-thematic, and fostering lifelong learning have completely changed the instructional design scene, allowing these innovations and new architectures of teaching and learning to be included. However, MOOCs have been criticized by the scientific community for their high dropout rates and low overall completion rates, which has called into question their effectiveness as a pedagogical tool. This study analyzes how the application of gamification strategies in MOOCs on energy sustainability affects participants’ engagement and seeks to identify what types of interactive gamification media are more useful in generating interest and motivation in students. In order to do so, a mixed quasi-experimental method is used. A gamification board with challenges, badges, and leaderboards to a sample is used, and at the same time, this platform is analyzed using the Integrated Theoretical Gamification Model in e-Learning Environments (E-MIGA). In the MOOCs where gamification strategies were applied, a global completion rate of 14.43% was obtained, while in those without gamification, 6.162% was obtained. Likewise, the degree of student engagement with respect to the completion rate of activities was much higher in the gamified platform (28.032%) than in the traditional design (13.252%). The results show that applying gamification strategies in MOOCs achieves a higher level of engagement and student motivation.","authors":["Luis M Romero-Rodriguez","María-Soledad Ramírez-Montoya","Jaime Ricardo Valenzuela González"],"meta":["March 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903230","Project: Gamification & Education"],"references":["319103049_Ludificacion_y_sus_posibilidades_en_el_entorno_de_blended_learning_revision_documental_Gamification_and_its_possibilities_in_the_blended_learning_environment_literature_review","317417948_Gamification_in_MOOCs_to_enhance_users'_goal_achievement","311506817_Challenge-based_gamification_as_a_teaching'_open_educational_innovation_strategy_in_the_energy_sustainability_area","301889450_New_Challenges_for_the_Motivation_and_Learning_in_Engineering_Education_Using_Gamification_in_MOOC","286690038_Making_Sense_of_MOOCs_Musings_in_a_Maze_of_Myth_Paradox_and_Possibility","324603437_From_sMOOC_to_tMOOC_learning_towards_professional_transference_ECO_European_Project","313246228_Gamification_in_MOOC_Challenges_opportunities_and_proposals_for_advancing_MOOC_model","300644427_Gamification_in_e-Learning_Systems_A_Conceptual_Model_to_Engage_Students_and_Its_Application_in_an_Adaptive_e-Learning_System","300588016_Gamification_of_Education_A_Review_of_Literature","290164304_MOOCs_as_Neocolonialism_Who_Controls_Knowledge"]}
