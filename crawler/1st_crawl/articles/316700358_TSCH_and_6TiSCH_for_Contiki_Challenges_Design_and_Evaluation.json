{"id":"316700358_TSCH_and_6TiSCH_for_Contiki_Challenges_Design_and_Evaluation","abstract":"Synchronized communication has recently emerged as a prime option for low-power critical applications. Solutions such as Glossy or Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) have demonstrated end-to-end reliability upwards of 99.99%. In this context, the IETF Working Group 6TiSCH is currently standardizing the mechanisms to use TSCH in low-power IPv6 scenarios. This paper identifies a number of challenges when it comes to implementing the 6TiSCH stack. It shows how these challenges can be addressed with practical solutions for locking, queuing, scheduling and other aspects. With this implementation as an enabler, we present an experimental validation and comparison with state-of-the-art MAC protocols. We conduct fine-grained energy profiling, showing\nthe impact of link-layer security on packet transmission. We evaluate distributed time synchronization in a 340-node testbed, and demonstrate that tight synchronization (hundreds of microseconds) can be achieved at very low cost (0.3% duty cycle, 0.008% channel utilization). We finally compare TSCH against traditional MAC layers: low-power listening (LPL) and CSMA, in terms of reliability, latency and energy. We show\nthat with proper scheduling, TSCH achieves by far the highest reliability, and outperforms LPL in both energy and latency.","authors":["Simon Duquennoy","Atis Elsts","Beshr Al Nahas","George Oikonomou"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1109/DCOSS.2017.29","Conference: International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)"],"references":["316700189_Adaptive_channel_selection_in_IEEE_802154_TSCH_networks","315380418_Demo_SPES-2_-_A_Sensing_Platform_for_Maintenance-Free_Residential_Monitoring","309690225_Impact_of_Guard_Time_Length_on_IEEE_802154e_TSCH_Energy_Consumption","306167281_Microsecond-Accuracy_Time_Synchronization_Using_the_IEEE_802154_TSCH_Protocol","304909486_Link-layer_Security_in_TSCH_Networks_Effect_on_Slot_Duration","301278852_Analysis_and_experimental_evaluation_of_IEEE_802154e_TSCH_CSMA-CA_Algorithm","282667659_FIT_IoT-LAB_A_large_scale_open_experimental_IoT_testbed","309076880_Trickle_A_selfregulating_algorithm_for_code_propagation_and_maintenance_in_wireless_sensor_networks","295120538_Industrial_Wireless_IP-Based_Cyber_-Physical_Systems","282748590_Indriya_A_Low-Cost_3D_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Testbed"]}
