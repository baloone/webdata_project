{"id":"280589778_New_q-ary_Quantum_MDS_Codes_with_Distances_Bigger_than_fracq2","abstract":"Constructions of quantum MDS codes have been studied by many authors. We\nrefer to the table in page 1482 of [3] for known constructions. However there\nare only few $q$-ary quantum MDS $[[n,n-2d+2,d]]_q$ codes with minimum\ndistances $d>\\frac{q}{2}$ for sparse lengths $n>q+1$. In the case\n$n=\\frac{q^2-1}{m}$ where $m|q+1$ or $m|q-1$ there are complete results. In the\ncase $n=\\frac{q^2-1}{m}$ where $m|q^2-1$ is not a factor of $q-1$ or $q+1$,\nthere is no $q$-ary quantum MDS code with $d> \\frac{q}{2}$ has been\nconstructed. In this paper we propose a direct approch to construct Hermitian\nself-orthogonal codes over ${\\bf F}_{q^2}$. Thus we give some new $q$-ary\nquantum codes in this case. Moreover we present many new $q$-ary quantum MDS\ncodes with lengths of the form $\\frac{w(q^2-1)}{u}$ and minimum distances $d >\n\\frac{q}{2}$.","authors":["Xianmang He","Liqing Xu","Hao Chen"],"meta":["July 2015Quantum Information Processing 15(7)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-016-1311-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["272521810_Quantum_MDS_Codes_over_Small_Fields","260715806_Application_of_Constacyclic_Codes_to_Quantum_MDS_Codes","258442171_A_construction_of_new_quantum_MDS_codes","254061659_Euclidean_and_Hermitian_Self-Orthogonal_Algebraic_Geometry_Codes_and_Their_Application_to_Quantum_Codes","277161463_Quantum_generalized_Reed-Solomon_codes_Unified_framework_for_quantum_MDS_codes","262526151_New_quantum_MDS_codes_derived_from_constacyclic_codes","260800486_Constacyclic_Codes_and_Some_New_Quantum_MDS_Codes","260542013_New_Quantum_MDS_Codes_From_Negacyclic_Codes","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","228109598_Perfect_Quantum_Error_Correcting_Code"]}
