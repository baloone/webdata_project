{"id":"343030743_Optimized_Wavelet-Based_Satellite_Image_De-Noising_With_Multi-Population_Differential_Evolution-Assisted_Harris_Hawks_Optimization_Algorithm","abstract":"In this research, we propose to utilize the newly introduced Multi-population differential evolution-assisted Harris Hawks Optimization Algorithm (CMDHHO) in the optimization process for satellite image denoising in the wavelet domain. This optimization algorithm is the improved version of the previous HHO algorithm which consists of chaos, multi-population, and differential evolution strategies. In this study, we applied several optimization algorithms in the optimization procedure and we compared the de-noising results with CMDHHO based noise suppression as well as with the Thresholding Neural Network (TNN) approaches. It is observed that applying the CMDHHO algorithm provides us with better qualitative and quantitative results comparing with other optimized and TNN based noise removal techniques. In addition to the quality and quantity improvement, this method is computationally efficient and improves the processing time. Based on the experimental analysis, optimized based noise suppression performs better than TNN based image de-noising. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) are used to evaluate and measure the performance of different de-noising methods. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed CMDHHO based satellite image de-noising over other available approaches in the literature.","authors":["Noorbakhsh Amiri Golilarz","Mirpouya Mirmozaffari","Tayyebeh Asgari Gashteroodkhani","Liaqat Ali"],"meta":["July 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010127"],"references":["339810901_A_novel_quasi-reflected_Harris_hawks_optimization_algorithm_for_global_optimization_problems","336268733_A_New_Automatic_Method_for_Control_Chart_Patterns_Recognition_Based_on_ConvNet_and_Harris_Hawks_Meta_Heuristic_Optimization_Algorithm","331416553_Harris_hawks_optimization_Algorithm_and_applications","330878414_Hyper-Spectral_Remote_Sensing_Image_De-Noising_with_Three_Dimensional_Wavelet_Transform_Utilizing_Smooth_Nonlinear_Soft_Thresholding_Function","332772781_Satellite_Image_De-Noising_With_Harris_Hawks_Meta_Heuristic_Optimization_Algorithm_and_Improved_Adaptive_Generalized_Gaussian_Distribution_Threshold_Function","331465639_Adaptive_Generalized_Gaussian_Distribution_Oriented_Thresholding_Function_for_Image_De-Noising","328816240_Speckle_Suppression_Based_on_Weighted_Nuclear_Norm_Minimization_and_Grey_Theory","326949673_Hankel_Low-Rank_Approximation_for_Seismic_Noise_Attenuation","326599876_Image_denoising_using_neighbouring_wavelet_coefficients","324430296_Multispectral_Satellite_Image_Denoising_via_Adaptive_Cuckoo_Search-Based_Wiener_Filter"]}
