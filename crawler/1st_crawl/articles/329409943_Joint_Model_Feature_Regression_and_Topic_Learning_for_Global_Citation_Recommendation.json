{"id":"329409943_Joint_Model_Feature_Regression_and_Topic_Learning_for_Global_Citation_Recommendation","abstract":"Citation recommendation has gained increasing attention in recent years. In practice, researchers usually prefer to cite the most topic-relevant articles. Nevertheless, how to model the implicit correlations between topics and citations is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel citation recommendation model, called TopicCite, which mines such fine-grained correlations. We extract various citation features from citation network, and integrate the learning process of feature regression with topic modeling. At the recommendation stage, we expand the folding-in process by adding the topic influence of papers that correlated with user-provided information. TopicCite can also be considered a technique for extracting topic-related citation features from manually defined citation features, which can essentially improve the granularity of pre-extracted features. In addition, the unsupervised topic model is supervised and mutually reinforced by abundant citation features in TopicCite; thus, the proposed model can also extract more reliable topic distributions from citation data, which brings a new perspective to topic discovery on linked data. The experimental results on the AAN and DBLP datasets demonstrate that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Tao Dai","Li Zhu","Yifan Wang","Zhang Hongfei"],"meta":["December 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2884981"],"references":["324499400_Heterogeneous_Information_Network_Embedding_based_Personalized_Query-Focused_Astronomy_Reference_Paper_Recommendation","323887898_Conference_Paper_Recommendation_for_Academic_Conferences","320733235_Concept-Based_Approach_for_Research_Paper_Recommendation","318144401_Explore_semantic_topics_and_author_communities_for_citation_recommendation_in_bipartite_bibliographic_network","283564168_Joint_Structure_Feature_Exploration_and_Regularization_for_Multi-Task_Graph_Classification","262323774_A_unified_graph_model_for_personalized_query-oriented_reference_paper_recommendation","221654448_New_perspectives_and_methods_in_link_prediction","221299609_Recommending_citations_for_academic_papers","221299140_Some_Simple_Effective_Approximations_to_the_2-Poisson_Model_for_Probabilistic_Weighted_Retrieval","221024035_Object-level_ranking_Bringing_order_to_web_objects","221022438_Topic_modeling_with_network_regularization","220924672_Enhancing_digital_libraries_with_TechLens","220923902_Scholarly_paper_recommendation_via_user's_recent_research_interests","220343825_Hofmann_T_Unsupervised_Learning_by_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Analysis_Machine_Learning_421-2_177-196","51986580_ArnetMiner_Extraction_and_Mining_of_Academic_Social_Networks","326594411_Social_Recommendation_With_Evolutionary_Opinion_Dynamics","324508433_A_Three-Layered_Mutually_Reinforced_Model_for_Personalized_Citation_Recommendation","323164826_Adversarially_Regularized_Graph_Autoencoder","322058583_Query-Focused_Personalized_Citation_Recommendation_With_Mutually_Reinforced_Ranking","318072359_Exploiting_Fine-Grained_Co-Authorship_for_Personalized_Citation_Recommendation","297743322_Task_Sensitive_Feature_Exploration_and_Learning_for_Multitask_Graph_Classification","263665351_Unsupervised_language_model_adaptation_using_LDA-based_mixture_models_and_latent_semantic_marginals","262168123_Plink-LDA_Using_Link_as_Prior_Information_in_Topic_Modeling","238832569_Publication_outlets_and_their_effect_on_academic_writers'_citations","236005641_Recommending_citations_Translating_papers_into_references","221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm","221654332_Collaborative_topic_modeling_for_recommending_scientific_articles","221653193_Joint_latent_topic_models_for_text_and_citations","221519997_Citation_Recommendation_without_Author_Supervision","221158792_Research_Paper_Recommender_Systems_A_Random-Walk_Based_Approach","221022550_Context-aware_citation_recommendation","220923677_CARES_a_ranking-oriented_CADAL_recommender_system","220629890_RPLSA_A_novel_updating_scheme_for_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","220435562_Authors_as_Citers_over_Time","220321034_Relational_Topic_Models_for_Document_Networks","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","3507704_Face_Recognition_Using_Eigenfaces","3297859_Using_Incremental_PLSI_for_Threshold-Resilient_Online_Event_Analysis","2374660_The_Missing_Link_-_A_Probabilistic_Model_of_Document_Content_and_Hypertext_Connectivity"]}
