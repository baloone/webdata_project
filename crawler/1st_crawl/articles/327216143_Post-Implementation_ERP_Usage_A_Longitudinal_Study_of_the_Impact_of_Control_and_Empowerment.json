{"id":"327216143_Post-Implementation_ERP_Usage_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_the_Impact_of_Control_and_Empowerment","abstract":"Organizations have invested in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems expecting to obtain benefits of the system and realize a healthy return on investment. Nonetheless, research indicates that employees rarely use ERP to its full potential. To tackle the challenge of underutilization, this article studies the longitudinal impact of control and empowerment on usage behaviors at the individual level. Results indicate that users engage in different but coexisting usage behaviors: routinization and infusion.","authors":["Jan-Bert Maas","Paul C. van Fenema","Joseph Soeters"],"meta":["October
