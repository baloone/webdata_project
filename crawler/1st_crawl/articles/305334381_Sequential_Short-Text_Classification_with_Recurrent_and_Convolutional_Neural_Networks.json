{"id":"305334381_Sequential_Short-Text_Classification_with_Recurrent_and_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Recent approaches based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown promising results for short-text classification. However, many short texts occur in sequences (e.g., sentences in a document or utterances in a dialog), and most existing ANN-based systems do not leverage the preceding short texts when classifying a subsequent one. In this work, we present a model based on recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks that incorporates the preceding short texts. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different datasets for dialog act prediction.","authors":["Ji Young Lee","Franck Dernoncourt"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.18653/v1/N16-1062","Conference: Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies"],"references":["266201822_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","265385879_On_the_Properties_of_Neural_Machine_Translation_Encoder-Decoder_Approaches","259703689_Dialogue_Act_Modeling_for_Automatic_Tagging_and_Recognition_of_Conversational_Speech","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","228675912_Automatic_Dialog_Act_Segmentation_and_Classification_in_Multiparty_Meetings","296223502_The_Fourth_Dialog_State_Tracking_Challenge","262367926_Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces","262204398_Baselines_and_Bigrams_Simple_Good_Sentiment_and_Topic_Classification","244504666_Switchboard_SWBD-DAMSL_shallow-discourse-function_annotation_coders_manual","237227557_Dialog_Act_Tagging_using_Memory-Based_Learning"]}
