{"id":"275671220_Dynamic_time_warping_under_pointwise_shape_context","abstract":"Similarity measures are of fundamental importance in time series data mining. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a quite popular measure because it handles time distortions well. However, DTW has an inherent shortcoming in that DTW can lead to pathological alignments between time series where a single point maps onto a large subsection of another time series. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel variant of DTW named SC-DTW. SC-DTW employs shape context, a rich local shape descriptor, to replace the raw observed values considered by conventional DTW. The main novelties of SC-DTW are (1) it deeply explores both the numerical nature and shape nature of time series; and (2) neighborhood information for each point is taken into account. SC-DTW can generate a more feature-to-feature alignment between time series and thus serves as a robust similarity measure. We test the performance of SC-DTW on UCR time series datasets using the one nearest neighbor (1NN) classifier. Compared with other well-established methods, SC-DTW provides better accuracy on 24 of 34 datasets.","authors":["Zheng Zhang","Ping Tang","Rubing Duan"],"meta":["September 2015Information Sciences 315","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2015.04.007"],"references":["230609880_sDTW_Computing_DTW_Distances_using_Locally_Relevant_Constraints_basedon_Salient_Feature_Alignments","221310976_LB_Keogh_Supports_Exact_Indexing_of_Shapes_under_Rotation_Invariance_with_Arbitrary_Representations_and_Distance_Measures","220907265_Making_Time-Series_Classification_More_Accurate_Using_Learned_Constraints","220634789_Real-Time_Video_Copy-Location_Detection_in_Large-Scale_Repositories","220507180_A_Survey_on_Shape_Correspondence","220451901_Efficiently_finding_unusual_shapes_in_large_image_databases","220311271_Dynamic_time_warping_constraint_learning_for_large_margin_nearest_neighbor_classification","220072532_Patch_Alignment_for_Dimensionality_Reduction","41910453_Automatic_Construction_of_Correspondences_for_Tubular_Surfaces","38105301_Computing_and_Visualizing_Dynamic_Time_Warping_Alignments_in_R_The_dtw_Package","6566151_Merging_microarray_cell_synchronization_experiments_through_curve_alignment","4022939_Shape_Context_and_Chamfer_Matching_in_Cluttered_Scenes","2528210_Shape_Matching_and_Object_Recognition_Using_Shape_Contexts","267572495_A_hybrid_fuzzy_time_series_model_based_on_granular_computing_for_stock_price_forecasting","262194488_Modeling_and_forecasting_financial_time_series_with_ordered_fuzzy_candlesticks","260350273_Event_Driven_Web_Video_Summarization_by_Tag_Localization_and_Key-Shot_Identification","254464501_Modeling_concept_dynamics_for_large_scale_music_search","235908291_Satellite_Image_Time_Series_Analysis_Under_Time_Warping","232256011_Robust_Anatomical_Correspondence_Detection_by_Hierarchical_Sparse_Graph_Matching","229155689_Semisupervised_Multiview_Distance_Metric_Learning_for_Cartoon_Synthesis","229021668_3D_shape_matching_with_3D_shape_contexts","227057866_Multivariate_interpolation_at_arbitrary_points_made_simple","225848816_Splines_minimizing_rotation-invariant_semi-norms_in_Sobolev_spaces","225223935_Pictorial_Structures_for_Object_Recognition","223295972_A_Review_on_Time_Series_Data_Mining","222666929_Lu_G_Review_of_Shape_Representation_and_Description_Techniques_Pattern_Recognition_37_1-19","222417894_Clustering_Time_Series_Data_-_A_Survey","222326718_A_segment-wise_time_warping_method_for_time_scaling_searching","221305293_A_Visual_Category_Filter_for_Google_Images","221299112_Effective_music_tagging_through_advanced_statistical_modeling","220602695_Weighted_dynamic_time_warping_for_time_series_classification","220517200_Beyond_Distance_Measurement_Constructing_Neighborhood_Similarity_for_Video_Annotation","220313960_Boundary-Based_Lower-Bound_Functions_for_Dynamic_Time_Warping_and_Their_Indexing","51674584_Automatic_Construction_of_PartsGeometry_Models_for_Initializing_Groupwise_Registration","51183614_Complex_Object_Correspondence_Construction_in_Two-Dimensional_Animation","45366555_Dynamic_Programming_and_Graph_Algorithms_in_Computer_Vision","8103234_WARP_Accurate_Retrieval_of_Shapes_Using_Phase_of_Fourier_Descriptors_and_Time_Warping_Distance","4815069_A_New_Approach_to_the_Economic_Analysis_of_Nonstationary_Time_Series_and_the_Business_Cycle","4023018_Word_image_matching_using_dynamic_time_warping","3954279_ECG_frame_classification_using_dynamic_time_warping","3192369_An_Experimental_Comparison_of_Autoregressive_and_Fourier-Based_Descriptors_in_2D_Shape_Classification","3176845_Performance_tradeoffs_in_dynamic_time_warping_algorithms_for_isolated_word_recognition","3176517_Memory_and_time_improvements_in_a_dynamic_programming_algorithm_for_matching_speech_patterns","3176441_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_Optimization_for_Spoken_Word_Recognition","3176074_Minimum_Prediction_Residual_Principle_Applied_to_Speech_Recognition","3045915_The_Representation_and_Matching_of_Pictorial_Structures","2472974_Word_Image_Matching_Using_Dynamic_Time_Warping","2398724_Derivative_Dynamic_Time_Warping","2281887_A_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Object_Recognition_Using_Local_Photometry_and_Global_Geometry"]}
