{"id":"309279461_Correlation_detection_and_an_operational_interpretation_of_the_Renyi_mutual_information","abstract":"A variety of new measures of quantum Rényi mutual information and quantum Rényi conditional entropy have recently been proposed, and some of their mathematical properties explored. Here, we show that the Rényi mutual information attains operational meaning in the context of composite hypothesis testing, when the null hypothesis is a fixed bipartite state and the alternative hypothesis consists of all product states that share one marginal with the null hypothesis. This hypothesis testing problem occurs naturally in channel coding, where it corresponds to testing whether a state is the output of a given quantum channel or of a “useless” channel whose output is decoupled from the environment. Similarly, we establish an operational interpretation of Rényi conditional entropy by choosing an alternative hypothesis that consists of product states that are maximally mixed on one system. Specialized to classical probability distributions, our results also establish an operational interpretation of Rényi mutual information and Rényi conditional entropy.","authors":["Masahito Hayashi","Marco Tomamichel"],"meta":["October 2016Journal of Mathematical Physics 57(10)","DOI:10.1063/1.4964755"],"references":["296632188_On_the_second-order_asymptotics_for_entanglement-assisted_communication","267118543_Sandwiched_Renyi_divergence_satisfies_data_processing_inequality","264790924_Strong_Converse_Exponents_for_a_Quantum_Channel_Discrimination_Problem_and_Quantum-Feedback-Assisted_Communication","264288039_Strong_Converse_for_the_Classical_Capacity_of_Entanglement-Breaking_and_Hadamard_Channels_via_a_Sandwiched_Rnyi_Relative_Entropy","258105936_Multiplicativity_of_Completely_Bounded_p-Norms_Implies_a_Strong_Converse_for_Entanglement-Assisted_Capacity","239524546_Second_Order_Asymptotics_of_Optimal_Approximate_Conversion_for_Probability_Distributions_and_Entangled_States_and_Its_Application_to_LOCC_Cloning","235893712_Fundamental_Bound_on_the_Reliability_of_Quantum_Information_Transmission","230613819_A_Hierarchy_of_Information_Quantities_for_Finite_Block_Length_Analysis_of_Quantum_Tasks","226962484_A_simple_proof_for_Konig's_minimax_theorem","225787782_A_Generalization_of_Quantum_Stein's_Lemma","224132864_Channel_Coding_Rate_in_the_Finite_Blocklength_Regime","222101122_Quantum_state_discrimination_bounds_for_finite_sample_size","45932274_One-Shot_Classical-Quantum_Capacity_and_Hypothesis_Testing","6331566_Discriminating_States_The_Quantum_Chernoff_Bound","3086225_An_Information-Spectrum_Approach_to_Classical_and_Quantum_Hypothesis_Testing_for_Simple_Hypotheses","3085056_On_Error_Exponents_in_Quantum_Hypothesis_Testing","3084766_General_formulas_for_capacity_of_classical-quantum_channels","3080250_Generalization_of_Gartner-Ellis_theorem","3079620_The_method_of_types_information_theory","308868617_Second-order_coding_rates_for_entanglement-assisted_communication","303965678_The_Method_of_Types","303436389_Strong_converse_theorems_in_quantum_information_theory","303226638_Quantum_Key_Distribution","300160904_The_Proper_Formula_for_Relative_Entropy_and_its_Asymptotics_in_Quantum_Probability","298426817_Bayesian_M-Ary_Hypothesis_Testing_The_Meta-Converse_and_Verdu-Han_Bounds_Are_Tight","283788393_Two_Approaches_to_Obtain_the_Strong_Converse_Exponent_of_Quantum_Hypothesis_Testing_for_General_Sequences_of_Quantum_States","276151163_Second-Order_Asymptotics_for_the_Classical_Capacity_of_Image-Additive_Quantum_Channels","274403331_Quantum_Information_Processing_with_Finite_Resources_-_Mathematical_Foundations","267466833_Introduction_to_Matrix_Analysis_and_Applications","265820700_Trace_inequalities_and_quantum_entropy_An_introductory_course","265209808_Investigating_Properties_of_a_Family_of_Quantum_Renyi_Divergences","262188980_Second-Order_Coding_Rates_for_Entanglement-Assisted_Communication","260500702_Saddle_Point_in_the_Minimax_Converse_for_Channel_Coding","258520801_Relating_different_quantum_generalizations_of_the_conditional_Renyi_entropy","258239816_Quantum_Information_An_Introduction","258082487_Hypothesis_Testing_on_Invariant_Subspaces_of_the_Symmetric_Group_Part_I_-_Quantum_Sanov's_Theorem_and_Arbitrarily_Varying_Sources","256499015_Quantum_Hypothesis_Testing_and_the_Operational_Interpretation_of_the_Quantum_Rnyi_Relative_Entropies","241278754_Monotonicity_of_a_relative_R'enyi_entropy","237197932_On_quantum_Renyi_entropies_A_new_generalization_and_some_properties","232272913_Finite_Blocklength_Converse_Bounds_for_Quantum_Channels","230613744_Second_Order_Asymptotics_for_Quantum_Hypothesis_Testing","226908730_Uber_das_von_Neumannsche_Minimax-Theorem","224460172_Min-_and_Max-Relative_Entropies_and_a_New_Entanglement_Monotone","223109796_Quasi-entropies_for_finite_quantum_systems","38347788_On_General_Minimax_Theorems","38331077_The_proper_formula_for_relative_entropy_and_its_asymptotics_in_quantum_probability","24173602_Postselection_Technique_for_Quantum_Channels_with_Applications_to_Quantum_Cryptography","23635486_A_note_on_moment_generating_functions","3830988_Strong_converse_theorems_in_the_quantum_information_theory","3080208_Strong_Converse_and_Stein's_Lemma_in_Quantum_Hypothesis_Testing","2202098_Asymptotics_of_Quantum_Relative_Entropy_From_Representation_Theoretical_Viewpoint","2199026_The_Chernoff_lower_bound_for_symmetric_quantum_hypothesis_testing","3078207_On_the_Converse_Theorem_in_Statistical_Hypothesis_Testing_for_Markov_Chains","2200076_The_Converse_Part_of_The_Theorem_for_Quantum_Hoeffding_Bound","2199802_Error_Exponent_in_Asymmetric_Quantum_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Its_Application_to_Classical-Quantum_Channel_coding"]}
