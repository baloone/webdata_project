{"id":"225163684_Effect_of_Stochastic_Noise_on_Superior_Julia_Sets","abstract":"Julia sets are considered one of the most attractive fractals and have wide range of applications in science and engineering.\nThe strong physical meaning of Mandelbrot and Julia sets is broadly accepted and nicely connected by Christian Beck (Physica\nD 125(3–4):171–182, 1999) to the complex logistic maps, in the former case, and to the inverse complex logistic map, in the latter. Argyris etal.\n(Chaos Solitons Fractals 11(13):2067–2073, 2000) have studied the effect of noise on Julia sets and concluded that Julia sets are stable for noises of low strength, and\na small increment in the strength of noise may cause considerable deterioration in the configuration of the Julia sets. It\nis well-known that the method of function iterates plays a crucial role in discrete dynamics utilizing the techniques of fractal\ntheory. However, recently Rani and Kumar (J. Korea Soc. Math. Edu. Ser. D: Res. Math. Edu. 8(4):261–277, 2004) introduced superior iterations as a generalization of function iterations in the study of Julia sets and studied superior\nJulia sets. This technique is further utilized to study effectively new Mandelbrot sets and related properties (see, for instance,\nNegi and Rani, Chaos Solitons Fractals 36(2):237–245, 2008; 36(4):1089–1096, 2008, Rani and Kumar, J. Korea Soc. Math. Edu. Ser.D: Res. Math. Edu. 8(4):279–291, 2004). The intent of this paper is to study certain effects of noise on superior Julia sets. We find that the superior Julia sets\nare drastically more stable for higher strength of noises than the classical Julia sets. Finally, we make a humble attempt\nto discuss some applications of superior orbit in discrete dynamics and of superior Julia sets in particle dynamics.","authors":["Mamta Rani","Rashi Agarwal"],"meta":["August 2010Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 36(1):63-68","DOI:10.1007/s10851-009-0171-0","SourceDBLP"],"references":["264030621_Superior_Julia_Set","264018922_Superior_Mandelbrot_Set","250727585_The_complex_dynamics_of_Newton's_method_for_a_double_root","321500638_Fractals_and_Chaos","292288401_A_new_experiment_with_the_logistic_map","279235850_Chaos_and_Fractals_New_Frontiers_of_Science","273047723_A_First_Course_in_Chaotic_Dynamical_Systems_Theory_and_Experiment","268657145_A_first_course_in_chaotic_dynamical_systems_Theory_and_experiment","262486892_Fractal_Geometry_Mathematical_Foundations_and_Applications","257413623_A_new_approach_to_dynamic_noise_on_superior_Mandelbrot_set","253775212_Fractals_and_chaos_the_Mandelbrot_set_and_beyond_Selecta_volume_C","243332201_On_perturbations_of_the_Mandelbrot_map","243332093_On_the_Julia_set_of_the_perturbed_Mandelbrot_map","242328949_Chaos_and_Fractals_New_Frontiers_of_Science","239621466_Beck_C_Physical_meaning_for_Mandelbrot_and_Julia_sets_Physica_D_125_171-182","238941776_A_new_experimental_approach_to_study_the_stability_of_logistic_map","236853799_Fractals_and_Chaos_The_Mandelbrot_Set_and_Beyond","229354908_Julia_Sets_in_Iterative_KAM_Methods_for_Eigenvalue_Problems","229334217_On_the_Julia_sets_of_a_noise-perturbed_Mandelbrot_map","223052060_The_influence_of_noise_on_the_correlation_dimension_of_chaotic_attractors","222930182_Additive_perturbed_generalized_Mandelbrot-Julia_sets","222800141_Schroder_iteration_functions_associated_with_a_one-parameter_family_of_biquadratic_polynomials","222593491_Midgets_of_superior_Mandelbrot_set","220695478_Fractal_Geometry_Mathematical_Foundations_and_Applications_Second_Edition","220562011_The_generalized_Mandelbrot_set_perturbed_by_composing_noise_of_additive_and_multiplicative","220560584_The_Julia_set_of_Newton's_method_for_multiple_root","220251501_Dynamics_of_Newton's_method_for_solving_some_equations","31641487_Fractal_Geometry_Mathematical_Foundations_and_Applications_K_Falconer","3716404_Visualization_of_controllable_regions_in_real-time_systems_using_a3D-Julia_set_methodology"]}
