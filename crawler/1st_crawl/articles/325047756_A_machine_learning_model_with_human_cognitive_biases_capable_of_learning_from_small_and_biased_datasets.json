{"id":"325047756_A_machine_learning_model_with_human_cognitive_biases_capable_of_learning_from_small_and_biased_datasets","abstract":"Human learners can generalize a new concept from a small number of samples. In contrast, conventional machine learning methods require large amounts of data to address the same types of problems. Humans have cognitive biases that promote fast learning. Here, we developed a method to reduce the gap between human beings and machines in this type of inference by utilizing cognitive biases. We implemented a human cognitive model into machine learning algorithms and compared their performance with the currently most popular methods, na√Øve Bayes, support vector machine, neural networks, logistic regression and random forests. We focused on the task of spam classification, which has been studied for a long time in the field of machine learning and often requires a large amount of data to obtain high accuracy. Our models achieved superior performance with small and biased samples in comparison with other representative machine learning methods.","authors":["Hidetaka Taniguchi","Hiroshi Sato","Tomohiro Shirakawa"],"meta":["May 2018Scientific Reports 8(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-25679-z"],"references":["301879687_Building_Machines_That_Learn_and_Think_Like_People","285850238_Cognitive_Symmetry_Illogical_but_Rational_Biases","313559779_Judgment_under_uncertainty_Heuristics_and_biases_In_P_Johnson-Laird_and_P_Wason","312446032_Availability_A_heuristic_for_judging_frequency_and_probability","297473301_Children's_avoidance_of_lexical_overlap_A_pragmatic_account","288906520_Random_forests","287678458_Bias_reformulation_for_one-shot_function_induction","286764893_Human-level_concept_learning_through_probabilistic_program_induction","285764506_One_shot_learning_of_simple_visual_concepts","282707871_Nearest_Neighbor_Pattern_Classification"]}
