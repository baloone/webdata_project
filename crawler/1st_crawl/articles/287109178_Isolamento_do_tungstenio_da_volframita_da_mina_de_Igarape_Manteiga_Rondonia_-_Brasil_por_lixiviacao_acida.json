{"id":"287109178_Isolamento_do_tungstenio_da_volframita_da_mina_de_Igarape_Manteiga_Rondonia_-_Brasil_por_lixiviacao_acida","abstract":"We report results of the efficiency of tungsten extraction from wolframite concentrate (containing 61.5 wt % WO3) from the Igarapé Manteiga mine (state of Rondônia, Brazil) through acid leaching with strong mineral acids at 100 ºC and 400 rpm for 2-4 h. HCl yielded insoluble matter containing the highest WO3 content (90 wt %). This solid was dissolved in concentrated NH3(aq) at 25 ºC and the insoluble matter filtrated. The filtrate was slowly evaporated. 70 wt % of the tungsten present in the starting concentrate material was recovered as ammonium paratungstate (APT).","authors":["Jéssica Paulino","Julio Carlos Afonso","José Luiz Mantovano","Cláudio Augusto Vianna"],"meta":["January 2012Química Nova 35(9):1854-1857","DOI:10.1590/S0100-40422012000900026"],"references":["240408197_Studies_on_the_preparation_of_pure_ammonium_para_tungstate_from_tungsten_alloy_scrap","238486141_Thermal_Analysis_and_X-ray_Diffraction_of_Synthesis_of_Scheelite","232392562_Investigation_of_the_direct_hydrometallurgical_processing_of_mechanically_activated_low-grade_wolframite_concentrate"]}
