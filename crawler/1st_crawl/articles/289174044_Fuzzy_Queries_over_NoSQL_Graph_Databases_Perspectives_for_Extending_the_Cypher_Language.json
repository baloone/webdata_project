{"id":"289174044_Fuzzy_Queries_over_NoSQL_Graph_Databases_Perspectives_for_Extending_the_Cypher_Language","abstract":"When querying databases, users often wish to express vague concepts, as for instance asking for the cheap hotels. This has been extensively studied in the case of relational databases. In this paper, we propose to study how such useful techniques can be adapted to NoSQL graph databases where the role of fuzziness is crucial. Such databases are indeed among the fastest-growing models for dealing with big data, especially when dealing with network data (e.g., social networks). We consider the Cypher declarative query language proposed for Neo4j which is the current leader on this market, and we present how to express fuzzy queries.","authors":["Arnaud Castelltort","Anne Laurent"],"meta":["July 2014Communications in Computer and Information Science 444:384-395","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-08852-5_40","Conference: International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems"],"references":["221218429_Fuzzy_OWL_Uncertainty_and_the_Semantic_Web","221022380_Scalable_querying_services_over_fuzzy_ontologies","289650405_A_knowledge-based_fuzzy_query_and_results_ranking_approach_for_relational_databases","261493039_Representing_history_in_graph-oriented_NoSQL_databases_A_versioning_system","233442867_Cartographic_transformation_of_the_thematic_map_base","221537667_Teaching_EBNF_first_in_CS_1","221465844_A_server_for_fuzzy_SQL_queries","221465669_Implementing_Fuzzy_Querying_via_the_InternetWWW_Java_Applets_ActiveX_Controls_and_Cookies","221463822_f-SPARQL_A_Flexible_Extension_of_SPARQL","220043147_FTMnodes_Fuzzy_tree_mining_based_on_partial_inclusion","45910521_The_Graph_Traversal_Pattern","3335581_SQLF_a_relational_database_language_for_fuzzy_querying","3113987_A_Fuzzy_Query_Language_for_Relational_Databases"]}
