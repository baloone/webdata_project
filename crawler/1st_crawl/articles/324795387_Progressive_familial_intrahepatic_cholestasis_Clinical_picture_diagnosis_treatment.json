{"id":"324795387_Progressive_familial_intrahepatic_cholestasis_Clinical_picture_diagnosis_treatment","abstract":"Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a genetically determined disease with the autosomal recessive type of inheritance and a high risk for development in children born to closely related parents. Disease is characterized by intrahepatic cholestasis. Three types of disease have been identified with their specific defects of particular genes. Polymorphism of manifestations of all 3 types necessitates their early differential diagnosis. The tactics of management of patients with each form of disease has its specificities. Liver transplantation may be needed in some cases, for example, in rapid progression of disease to liver cirrhosis in type 1, or surgical intervention may be possible, which would permit to divert bile externally in order to prevent fulminant development of liver cirrhosis and to cope with clinical symptoms. Early diagnosis helps to delay invalidation of the paediatric population with this disease, to start adjuvant therapy in due time and to determine indications for liver transplantation, which might help reduce economic costs.","authors":["G.
