{"id":"261833103_Efficient_Synthesis_of_Universal_Repeat-Until-Success_Quantum_Circuits","abstract":"Recently, it was shown that Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) circuits can achieve a\n$2.5$ times reduction in expected $T$-count over ancilla-free techniques for\nsingle-qubit unitary decomposition. However, the previously best known\nalgorithm to synthesize RUS circuits requires exponential classical runtime. In\nthis paper we present an algorithm to synthesize an RUS circuit to approximate\nany given single-qubit unitary within precision $\\varepsilon$ in\nprobabilistically polynomial classical runtime. Our synthesis approach uses the\nClifford+$T$ basis, plus one ancilla qubit and measurement. We provide\nnumerical evidence that our RUS circuits have an expected $T$-count on average\n$2.5$ times lower than the theoretical lower bound of $3 \\log_2\n(1/\\varepsilon)$ for ancilla-free single-qubit circuit decomposition.","authors":["Alex Bocharov","Martin Roetteler","Krysta Marie Svore"],"meta":["April 2014Physical Review Letters arXiv:1404.5320(8)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.080502","Project: Synthesis of measurement-assisted unitary circuits"],"references":["259441234_Remarks_on_Matsumoto_and_Amano's_normal_form_for_single-qubit_CliffordT_operators","258302450_Faster_quantum_chemistry_simulation_on_fault-tolerant_quantum_computers","314074386_Diophantine_approximation","265464092_Open_problems_in_Diophantine_approximation","265333188_Matrix_theory_Basic_results_and_techniques","260756038_Optimal_ancilla-free_CliffordT_approximation_of_z-rotations","258780734_Distillation_of_nonstabilizer_states_for_universal_quantum_computation","258247804_Repeat-Until-Success_Non-deterministic_decomposition_of_single-qubit_unitaries","255983557_An_algorithm_for_the_T-count","237197990_Synthesis_of_unitaries_with_CliffordT_circuits"]}
