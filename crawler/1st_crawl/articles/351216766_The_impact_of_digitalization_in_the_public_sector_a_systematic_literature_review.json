{"id":"351216766_The_impact_of_digitalization_in_the_public_sector_a_systematic_literature_review","abstract":"The digitalization of public administration is increasingly moving forward. This systematic literature review analyzes empirical studies that explore the impacts of digitalization projects (n=93) in the public sector. Bibliometrically, only a few authors have published several times on this topic so far. Most studies focusing on impact come from the US or China, and are related to Computer Science. In terms of content, the majority of examined articles studies services to citizens, and therefore consider them when measuring impact. A classification of the investigated effects by dimensions of public value shows that the analysis of utilitarian-instrumental values, such as efficiency or performance, is prevalent. More interdisciplinary cooperation is needed to research the impact of digitalization in the public sector. The different dimensions of impact should be linked more closely. In addition, research should focus more on the effects of digitalization within administration.","authors":["Caroline Fischer","Moritz Heuberger","Moreen Heine"],"meta":["April 2021","DOI:10.3224/dms.v14i1.13"],"references":["351209765_Measuring_policy_effects_online_participation_on_the_municipal_level_Policy-Effekte_messen_Online-Partizipation_auf_kommunaler_Ebene","349645104_Support_and_Resistance_of_Public_Officials_Towards_Current_eGovernment_Initiatives_-_A_Case_Study_on_Ukraine_and_Germany","349171529_Exploring_data-in-use_the_value_of_data_for_Local_Government","349168658_Digital_transformation_From_hierarchy_to_network-based_collaboration_The_case_of_the_German_Online_Access_Act","349168507_Coordinating_the_digital_transformation_of_inter-organizational_public_services_-_The_case_of_e-invoicing_in_Belgium","348458032_The_Future_of_Local_Self-Government_European_Trends_in_Autonomy_Innovations_and_Central-Local_Relations_European_Trends_in_Autonomy_Innovations_and_Central-Local_Relations","346610998_Digitalization_of_Public_Services-An_Input_Output_Logit_Analysis","345326104_Limitations_to_Building_Institutional_Trustworthiness_through_E-Government_A_Comparative_Study_of_Two_E-Services_in_Chile","351216283_Digital_Citizenship_-_A_Review_of_the_Academic_Literature","348470829_Challenges_of_Digital_Service_Provision_for_Local_Governments_from_the_Citizens'_View_Comparing_Citizens'_Expectations_and_Their_Experiences_of_Digital_Service_Provision","344059552_Beyond_COVID-19_Five_commentaries_on_expert_knowledge_executive_action_and_accountability_in_governance_and_public_administration","335989165_Does_Citizen_Coproduction_Lead_to_Better_Urban_Services_in_Smart_Cities_Projects_An_Empirical_Study_on_E-Participation_in_a_Mobile_Big_Data_Platform","334184935_Digitale_Transformation_als_Reformvorhaben_der_deutschen_offentlichen_Verwaltung","340632684_Socio-Technical_Transitions_and_Organizational_Responses_Insights_from_E-Governance_Case_Studies","339567195_Biometric_Identification_for_Socioeconomic_Development_in_Ghana"]}
