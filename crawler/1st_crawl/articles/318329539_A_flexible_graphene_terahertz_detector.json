{"id":"318329539_A_flexible_graphene_terahertz_detector","abstract":"We present a flexible terahertz (THz) detector based on a graphene field-effect transistor fabricated on a plastic substrate. At room temperature, this detector reveals voltage responsivity above 2 V/W and estimated noise equivalent power (NEP) below 3 nW/Hz at 487 GHz. We have investigated the effects of bending strain on DC characteristics, voltage responsivity, and NEP of the detector, and the results reveal its robust performance. Our findings have shown that graphene is a promising material for the development of THz flexible technology.","authors":["Xinxin Yang","Andrei Vorobiev","Andrey Generalov","Michael Andersson"],"meta":["July 2017Applied Physics Letters 111(2):021102","DOI:10.1063/1.4993434","Project: dielectrics"],"references":["287213719_Highly_Flexible_and_Conductive_Printed_Graphene_for_Wireless_Wearable_Communications_Applications","270663711_Terahertz_compressive_imaging_with_metamaterial_spatial_light_modulators","310391835_A_flexible_and_wearable_terahertz_scanner","299433646_An_Accurate_Empirical_Model_Based_on_Volterra_Series_for_FET_Power_Detectors","280586876_Graphene_kirigami","277028573_Key_Issues_With_Printed_Flexible_Thin_Film_Transistors_and_Their_Application_in_Disposable_RF_Sensors","274967340_Antenna_Enhanced_Graphene_THz_Emitter_and_Detector","265473385_Antenna-integrated_06_THz_FET_direct_detectors_based_on_CVD_graphene","265130545_Shear_strain_induced_modulation_to_the_transport_properties_of_graphene","264247349_GHz_Flexible_Graphene_Transistors_for_Microwave_Integrated_Circuits"]}
