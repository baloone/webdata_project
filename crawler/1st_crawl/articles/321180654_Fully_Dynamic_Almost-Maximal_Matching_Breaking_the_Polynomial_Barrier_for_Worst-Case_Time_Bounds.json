{"id":"321180654_Fully_Dynamic_Almost-Maximal_Matching_Breaking_the_Polynomial_Barrier_for_Worst-Case_Time_Bounds","abstract":"Despite significant research efforts, the state-of-the-art algorithm for maintaining an approximate matching in fully dynamic graphs has a polynomial \\emph{worst-case} update time, even for very poor approximation guarantees. In a recent breakthrough, Bhattacharya, Henzinger and Nanongkai showed how to maintain a constant approximation to the minimum vertex cover, and thus also a constant-factor estimate of the maximum matching size, with polylogarithmic worst-case update time. Later (in SODA'17 Proc.) they improved the approximation factor all the way to $2+\\eps$. Nevertheless, the longstanding fundamental problem of \\emph{maintaining} an approximate matching with sub-polynomial worst-case time bounds remained open. In this work we present a randomized algorithm for maintaining an \\emph{almost-maximal} matching in fully dynamic graphs with polylogarithmic worst-case update time. Such a matching provides $(2+\\eps)$-approximations for both the maximum matching and the minimum vertex cover, for any $\\eps > 0$. Our result was done independently of the SODA'17 $(2+\\eps)$-approximation result of Bhattacharya et al., so it provides the first $(2+\\eps)$-approximation for minimum vertex cover (together with Bhattacharya et al.'s result) and the first $(2+\\eps)$-approximation for maximum (integral) matching. The worst-case update time of our algorithm, namely $O(\\poly(\\log n,\\eps^{-1}))$, holds deterministically, while the almost-maximality guarantee holds with high probability. Moreover, this guarantee also bounds the number of changes (replacements) to our matching in the worst-case. This result not only settles the aforementioned problem on dynamic matchings, but also provides essentially the best possible (under the unique games conjecture) approximation guarantee for dynamic vertex cover.","authors":["Moses Charikar","Shay Solomon"],"meta":["November 2017"],"references":["318560441_Online_bipartite_matching_with_amortized_Olog2_n_replacements","301268186_Faster_Fully_Dynamic_Matchings_with_Small_Approximation_Ratios","279310645_Fully_Dynamic_Matching_in_Bipartite_Graphs","275054743_Fault_Tolerant_BFS_Structures_A_Reinforcement-Backup_Tradeoff","273513632_Fully_Dynamic_Maximal_Matching_in_Olog_n_Update_Time","259151362_Orienting_Fully_Dynamic_Graphs_with_Worst-Case_Time_Bounds","224500350_Online_Bipartite_Perfect_Matching_With_Augmentations","221499631_An_Osqrtv_E_Algorithm_for_Finding_Maximum_Matching_in_General_Graphs","221219941_Online_Perfect_Matching_and_Mobile_Computing","314599801_Shortest_Augmenting_Paths_for_Online_Matchings_on_Trees","312252537_Fully_dynamic_all-pairs_shortest_paths_with_worst-case_update-time_revisited","312078356_Fully_Dynamic_Approximate_Maximum_Matching_and_Minimum_Vertex_Cover_in_O_log_3_n_Worst_Case_Update_Time","303901466_New_Deterministic_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Fully_Dynamic_Matching","301875879_On_Fully_Dynamic_Graph_Sparsifiers","301818009_Fully_Dynamic_Maximal_Matching_in_Constant_Update_Time","301268317_Dynamic_1_-Approximate_Matchings_A_Density-Sensitive_Approach","290613269_Orienting_Dynamic_Graphs_with_Applications_to_Maximal_Matchings_and_Adjacency_Queries","289047691_Dynamic_graph_connectivity_in_polylogarithmic_worst_case_time","269116826_Deterministic_Fully_Dynamic_Data_Structures_for_Vertex_Cover_and_Matching","261056395_Fully_Dynamic_1_e-Approximate_Matchings","248321322_Vertex_Cover_Might_be_Hard_to_Approximate_to_within_2","242600743_An_n2_algorithm_for_maximum_matching_in_bipartite_graphs","226087374_A_balanced_search_tree_with_O1_worst-case_update_time","221590842_Maintaining_a_Large_Matching_and_a_Small_Vertex_Cover","220574988_Universal_Classes_of_Hash_Functions","220268409_Worst-case_update_times_for_fully-dynamic_all-pairs_shortest_paths"]}
