{"id":"328516042_Monotonic_Distributive_Semilattices","abstract":"In the study of algebras related to non-classical logics, (distributive) semilattices are always present in the background. For example, the algebraic semantic of the {→, ∧, ⊤}-fragment of intuitionistic logic is the variety of implicative meet-semilattices (Chellas 1980; Hansen 2003). In this paper we introduce and study the class of distributive meet-semilattices endowed with a monotonic modal operator m. We study the representation theory of these algebras using the theory of canonical extensions and we give a topological duality for them. Also, we show how our new duality extends to some particular subclasses.","authors":["Sergio Arturo Celani","María Paula Menchon"],"meta":["November 2019Order 36(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11083-018-9477-0"],"references":["268863666_Topological_representation_of_distributive_semilattices","267091150_Some_remarks_on_distributive_semilattices","258516794_General_Lattice_Theory_second_edition","258514502_General_Lattice_Theory","226950452_Representation_of_Hilbert_algebras_and_implicative_semilattices","291284439_Canonical_Extensions_Esakia_Spaces_and_Universal_Models","264910597_Relational_and_neighborhood_semantics_for_intuitionistic_modal_logic","259810779_Modal_Logic","243779915_Boolean_Algebras_with_Operators_Part_I","242640524_Modal_Logic_An_Introduction"]}
