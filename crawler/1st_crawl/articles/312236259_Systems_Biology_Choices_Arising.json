{"id":"312236259_Systems_Biology_Choices_Arising","abstract":"“In my fields of interest, the regulation of developmental processes and the mechanisms of body plan evolution, it is clear that fundamental causal explanation must begin with genomically encoded regulatory information, because that is where these processes are determinatively encoded. This is producing one of the real revolutions resulting from the advent of knowledge of genomes, i.e., genomics. Looking forward, it seems inevitable that scientific initiatives in this field that fail to provide explanations of developmental or evolutionary processes in terms that encompass genomic information will sooner or later be relegated to boutique status.”","authors":["Eric H.
