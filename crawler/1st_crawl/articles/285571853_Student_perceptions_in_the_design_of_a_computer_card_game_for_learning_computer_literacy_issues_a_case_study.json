{"id":"285571853_Student_perceptions_in_the_design_of_a_computer_card_game_for_learning_computer_literacy_issues_a_case_study","abstract":"The aim of this work was twofold. First, an empirical study was designed aimed at investigating the perceptions that entry-level non-computing majors -namely Physical Education and Sport Science (PESS) undergraduate students- hold about basic Computer Literacy (CL) issues. The participants were 90 first-year PESS students, and their perceptions were elicited through a written questionnaire. The data analysis revealed scientifically acceptable perceptions as well as various empirical, vague, incomplete and erroneous perceptions. Second, those studentsâ€™ prior knowledge was utilized to design and implement an Educational Computer Card Game (ECCG) aimed at helping PESS students overcome their conceptual difficulties and approach the aforementioned CL issues in a scientifically consistent manner. The ECCG was designed taking into account basic digital game-based learning principles in combination with basic aspects of social and constructivist perspectives to learning. The ECCG was also pilot-tested in the field with real students, and the results were encouraging.","authors":["Maria Kordaki","Marina Papastergiou","Panagiotis Psomos"],"meta":["January 2016Education and Information Technologies 21(4):837-862","DOI:10.1007/s10639-014-9356-2"],"references":["320655286_An_Examination_of_Students'_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_and_Demonstrated_Computer_Skills","257171429_Are_heavy_users_of_computer_games_and_social_media_more_computer_literate","248955738_Learning_to_play_in_digital_games","242513283_Digital_Game_Based_LEARNING_It's_Not_Just_the_Digital_Natives_Who_Are_Restless","237509649_Computer_Games_and_Learning_Why_do_we_think_it's_worth_talking_about_computer_games_and_learning_in_the_same_breath_A_discussion_paper","228685085_Computer_literacy_Today_and_tomorrow","227029196_A_computer_card_game_for_the_learning_of_basic_aspects_of_the_binary_system_in_primary_education_Design_and_pilot_evaluation","223383247_Information_and_communication_technologies_in_the_life_of_university_freshmen_An_analysis_of_change","220590608_A_Comparison_of_Student_Perceptions_of_Their_Computer_Skills_to_Their_Actual_Abilities","200772848_The_Next_Generation_of_Educational_Engagement","44824604_Research_Methods_in_Education","32231341_Literature_Review_in_Games_and_Learning","300301208_Mathematical_Enculturation_-_The_Process","292770369_Literature_review_in_games_and_learning","286906841_Game-Based_Learning_A_Strategy_to_Integrate_Digital_Games_in_Schools","286698676_Educational_computer_card_games_Results_from_empirical_studies_during_the_last_decade","281550395_Deep_learning_properties_of_good_digital_games_How_far_can_they_go","271787795_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","270960149_Research_Methods_In_Education","261621981_Computer_Games_as_Instructional_Tools","261366195_Does_Easy_Do_It_Children_Games_and_Learning","260050718_Implementing_Game-Based_Learning_The_MAPLET_Framework_as_a_Guide_to_Learner-Centred_Design_and_Assessment","257171192_A_10-year_assessment_of_information_and_communication_technology_tasks_required_in_undergraduate_agriculture_courses","248975070_Enhancing_science_instruction_The_use_of_'conflict_maps'","246776364_Mathematical_Enculturation_A_Cultural_Perspective_on_Mathematics_Education","243765883_Thinking_Technology_Toward_a_constructivist_design_model","242391086_Report_on_the_educational_use_of_games","242088120_Are_College_Students_Prepared_for_a_Technology-Rich_Learning_Environment","240343166_Multiple_intelligences_Enabling_diverse_learning","235284792_The_Motivation_of_Gameplay_or_the_REAL_21st_century_learning_revolution","234750318_An_Exploratory_Review_of_Design_Principles_in_Constructivist_Gaming_Learning_Environments","234728714_Certification_of_Computer_Literacy","234559075_Dimensions_of_Thinking_A_Framework_for_Curriculum_and_Instruction","233282169_The_role_of_ICT_in_science_education","229067909_Play_Dreams_And_Imitation_In_Childhood","228057878_Minimum_Cuts_and_Related_Problems","225083769_Research_methods_in_education_London_and_New_York","223301305_Digital_Game-Based_Learning_in_high_school_Computer_Science_education_Impact_on_educational_effectiveness_and_student_motivation","222228030_A_drawing_and_multi-representational_computer_environment_for_beginners'_learning_of_programming_using_C_Design_and_pilot_formative_evaluation","222079058_Enhancing_Physical_Education_and_Sport_Science_students'_self-efficacy_and_attitudes_regarding_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_through_a_computer_literacy_course","221211284_Computer_Assisted_Learning_with_Card_Game_in_System_Design_Concept","220706941_Redefining_computer_literacy_in_the_age_of_ubiquitous_computing","220373328_Reshaping_computer_literacy_teaching_in_higher_education_Identification_of_critical_success_factors","30874037_Digital_Game-Based_Learning"]}
