{"id":"332587810_Computing_First_General_Zagreb_Index_of_Operations_on_Graphs","abstract":"The numerical coding of the molecular structures on the bases of topological indices plays an important role in the subject of Cheminformatics which is a combination of Computer, Chemistry, and Information Science. In 1972, it was shown that the total \n$\\pi $ \n-electron energy of a molecular graph depends upon its structure and it can be obtained by the sum of the square of degrees of the vertices of a molecular graph. Later on, this sum was named as the first Zagreb index. In 2005, for \n$\\gamma \\epsilon R-\\{0,1\\}$ \n, the first general Zagreb index of a graph \n$G$ \nis defined as \n$M^{\\gamma }(G)=\\sum _{v\\epsilon V(G)}[d_{G}(v)]^{\\gamma }$ \n, where \n$d_{G}(v)$ \nis degree of the vertex \n$v$ \nin \n$G$ \n. In this paper, for each \n$\\gamma \\epsilon R-\\{0,1\\}$ \n, we study the first general Zagreb index of the cartesian product of two graphs such that one of the graphs is \n$D$ \n-sum graph and the other is any connected graph, where \n$D$ \n-sum graph is obtained by using certain \n$D$ \noperations on a connected graph. The obtained results are general extensions of the results of Deng \net al. \n[Applied Mathematics and Computation 275(2016): 422-431] and Akhter \net al. \n[AKCE Int. J. Graphs Combin. 14(2017): 70-79] who proved only for \n$\\gamma =2$ \nand \n$\\gamma =3$ \n, respectively.","authors":["Jia-Bao Liu","Saira Javed","Muhammad Javaid","Khurram Shabbir"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access 7:47494-47502","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909822"],"references":["312418930_Computing_the_forgotten_topological_index_of_four_operations_on_graphs","11008894_Application_of_Topological_Descriptors_in_QSAR_and_Drug_Design_History_and_New_Trends","288058896_The_Zagreb_indices_of_four_operations_on_graphs","273312317_Application_of_Topological_Index_in_Predicting_Ionic_Liquids_Densities_by_the_Quantitative_Structure_Property_Relationship_Method","272898426_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices","272388112_A_forgotten_topological_index","265350422_A_unified_approach_to_the_extremal_trees_for_different_indices","246863675_Molecular_Connectivity_in_Chemistry_and_Drug_Research","246775503_Mathatical_Concepts_in_Organic_Chemistry","244119992_Graph_theory_and_molecular_orbitals_The_loop_rule","231473566_On_Characterization_of_Molecular_Branching","229416908_Generalised_topological_indices_Optimisation_methodology_and_physico-chemical_interpretation","222254320_Graph_Theory_and_Molecular_Orbitals_Total_-Electron_Energy_of_Alternant_Hydrocarbons","220570902_Four_new_sums_of_graphs_and_their_Wiener_indices","220524462_On_Topological_Indices_Boiling_Points_and_Cycloalkanes","220319289_The_behavior_of_Wiener_indices_and_polynomials_of_graphs_under_five_graph_decorations","42309069_Structural_Determination_of_Paraffin_Boiling_Points","6323417_Medicinal_Chemistry_and_Bioinformatics_-_Current_Trends_in_Drugs_Discovery_with_Networks_Topological_Indices"]}
