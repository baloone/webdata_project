{"id":"333968262_ME3CA_-_Monitoring_Environment_Exercise_and_Emotion_by_a_Cognitive_Assistant","abstract":"The elderly population has increased dramatically in today’s society. This fact implies the need to propose new policies of attention to this group but without increasing social spending. Currently, there is a need to promote the care of elderly people in their own homes, avoiding being transferred to saturated residences. Bearing this in mind, in recent years numerous approaches have tried to offer solutions in this sense using the continuous advances in new information and communication technologies. In this way, this article proposes the employment of a personal assistant to help the elderly in the development of their daily life activities. The proposed system, called ME³CA, is a cognitive assistant that involves users in rehabilitating exercise, consisting of a sensorization platform and different integrated decision-making mechanisms. The system tries to plan and recommend activities to older people trying to improve their physical activity. In addition, in the decision making process the assistant takes into account the emotions of the user. In this way, the system is more personalized and emotionally intelligent.","authors":["J.A.
