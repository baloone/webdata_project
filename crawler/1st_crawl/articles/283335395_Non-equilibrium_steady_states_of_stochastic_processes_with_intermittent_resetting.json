{"id":"283335395_Non-equilibrium_steady_states_of_stochastic_processes_with_intermittent_resetting","abstract":"Stochastic processes that are randomly reset to an initial condition serve as\na showcase to investigate non-equilibrium steady states. However, all existing\nresults have been restricted to the special case of memoryless resetting\nprotocols. Here, we obtain the general solution for the distribution of\nprocesses in which waiting times between reset events are drawn from an\narbitrary distribution. This allows for the investigation of a broader class of\nmuch more realistic processes. As an example, our results are applied to the\nanalysis of the efficiency of constrained random search processes.","authors":["Stephan Eule","Jakob J Metzger"],"meta":["October 2015New Journal of Physics 18(3)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/18/3/033006","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265414909_First_Order_Transition_for_the_Optimal_Search_Time_of_Levy_Flights_with_Resetting","264545593_Diffusion_in_a_potential_landscape_with_stochastic_resetting","261714436_Diffusion_with_resetting_in_arbitrary_spatial_dimension","296141778_Kinetics_of_homogeneous_multistep_reactions_Preface","290615776_Fokker-Planck_Equation","282270906_A_Continuous-Time_Ehrenfest_Model_with_Catastrophes_and_Its_Jump-Diffusion_Approximation","275624793_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications","275619177_An_Introduction_To_Probability_Theory_And_Its_Applications","272845390_Dynamical_transition_in_the_temporal_relaxation_of_stochastic_processes_under_resetting","267164721_First_steps_in_random_walks_From_tools_to_applications"]}
