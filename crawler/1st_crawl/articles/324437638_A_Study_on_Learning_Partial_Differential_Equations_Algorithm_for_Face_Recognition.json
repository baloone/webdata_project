{"id":"324437638_A_Study_on_Learning_Partial_Differential_Equations_Algorithm_for_Face_Recognition","abstract":"Face recognition presents a challenging problem in the field of image analysis and computer vision, and it attention over the last few years because of its many applications in various domains. Partial differential equations (PDE) play an important role in many disciplines such as applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, material science, computer science, and etc. PDEs have been successfully applied to many image processing problems and computer vision. In this paper, an overview of few of the well-known methods is provided and some of the benefits and drawbacks of the schemes mentioned. This paper also mentions some of the most recent algorithms developed for this purpose and attempts to give an idea of the state of the art of face recognition technology using learning partial differential equations.","authors":["Moorthi S."],"meta":["April 2018","Project: Pattern Recognition"],"references":["261144367_Mathematical_Problems_in_Image_Processing","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","221618254_Distance_Metric_Learning_for_Large_Margin_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification","315888279_Feature_learning_via_partial_differential_equation_with_applications_to_face_recognition","286632024_Scale_space_filtering","275970953_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","244159241_Geometric_Curve_Evolution_and_Image_Processing","234799901_Geometry-Driven_Diffusion_in_Computer_Vision","226857211_Partial_differential_equations_and_finite-difference_methods_in_image_processing_part_1_Image_representation","225180015_Learning_PDEs_for_Image_Restoration_via_Optimal_Control","220635738_A_Survey_of_Face_Recognition_Techniques","220611570_Scale_and_the_differential_structure_of_images","200175449_Applications_of_Lie_groups_to_differential_equations_2nd_ed","51935419_Toward_Designing_Intelligent_PDEs_for_Computer_Vision_An_Optimal_Control_Approach","16718285_The_Structure_of_Images"]}
