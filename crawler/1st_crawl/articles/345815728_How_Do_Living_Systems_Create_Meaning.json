{"id":"345815728_How_Do_Living_Systems_Create_Meaning","abstract":"Meaning has traditionally been regarded as a problem for philosophers and psychologists. Advances in cognitive science since the early 1960s, however, broadened discussions of meaning, or more technically, the semantics of perceptions, representations, and/or actions, into biology and computer science. Here, we review the notion of “meaning” as it applies to living systems, and argue that the question of how living systems create meaning unifies the biological and cognitive sciences across both organizational and temporal scales.","authors":["Chris Fields","Michael Levin"],"meta":["November 2020Philosophies 5(4)","DOI:10.3390/philosophies5040036"],"references":["344805593_Selfhood_triumvirate_From_phenomenology_to_brain_activity_and_back_again","343513243_Circadian_clock_effects_on_cellular_proliferation_Insights_from_theory_and_experiments","343082614_Equivalence_of_the_Frame_and_Halting_Problems","342319106_Holographic_Screens_Are_Classical_Information_Channels","342220042_Complete_Topological_Mapping_of_a_Cellular_Protein_Interactome_Reveals_Bow-Tie_Motifs_as_Ubiquitous_Connectors_of_Protein_Complexes","346743040_Life_death_and_self_Fundamental_questions_of_primitive_cognition_viewed_through_the_lens_of_body_plasticity_and_synthetic_organisms","346568507_Information_flow_in_context-dependent_hierarchical_Bayesian_inference","344077862_Seeing_around_corners_Cells_solve_mazes_and_respond_at_a_distance_using_attractant_breakdown","343836567_Does_evolution_have_a_target_morphology","342569186_Do_Process-1_simulations_generate_the_epistemic_feelings_that_drive_Process-2_decision_making"]}
