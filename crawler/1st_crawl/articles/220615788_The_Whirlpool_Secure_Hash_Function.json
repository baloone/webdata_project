{"id":"220615788_The_Whirlpool_Secure_Hash_Function","abstract":"In this paper, we describe Whirlpool, which is a block-cipher-based secure hash function. Whirlpool produces a hash code of 512 bits for an input message of maximum length less than 2256 bits. The underlying block cipher, based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), takes a 512-bit key and oper- ates on 512-bit blocks of plaintext. Whirlpool has been endorsed by NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity, and Encryption), which is a European Union-sponsored effort to put forward a portfolio of strong crypto- graphic primitives of various types.","authors":["William Stallings"],"meta":["January 2006Cryptologia 30(1):55-67","DOI:10.1080/01611190500380090","SourceDBLP"],"references":["228610491_The_Whirlpool_hashing_function","221355615_Finding_Collisions_in_the_Full_SHA-1","221354712_A_Design_Principle_for_Hash_Functions","221354656_One_Way_Hash_Functions_and_DES","37442986_Perfect_diffusion_primitives_for_block_ciphers_-_Building_efficient_MDS_matrices","3180893_Efficient_architecture_and_hardware_implementation_of_the_Whirlpool_hash_function","2784036_Improved_Characteristics_for_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_Hash_Functions_Based_on_Block_Ciphers","261692283_The_advanced_encryption_standard","260353016_Electronic_document_authentication","243786424_Collisions_for_Hash_Functions_MD4","243677288_The_Status_of_MD5_After_a_Recent_Attack","227705697_Cryptographic_hash_functions","221609112_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_Hash_Functions_Based_on_Block_Ciphers","221354769_Hash_Functions_Based_on_Block_Ciphers_A_Synthetic_Approach","221347852_Confirmation_that_Some_Hash_Functions_Are_Not_Collision_Free","221010538_New_European_Schemes_for_Signature_Integrity_and_Encryption_NESSIE_A_Status_Report","220336893_Black-Box_Analysis_of_the_Block-Cipher-Based_Hash-Function_Constructions_from_PGV","200034020_Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems","13771413_Communication_theory_of_secrecy_systems_1945"]}
