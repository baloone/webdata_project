{"id":"260657439_Review_of_Microscopic_Lane-Changing_Models_and_Future_Research_Opportunities","abstract":"Driver behaviors, particularly lane-changing behaviors, have an important effect on the safety and throughput of the roadway-vehicle-based transportation system. Lane-changing models are a vital component of various microscopic traffic simulation tools, which are extensively used and playing an increasingly important role in Intelligent Transportation Systems studies. The authors conducted a detailed review and systematic comparison of existing microscopic lane-changing models that are related to roadway traffic simulation to provide a better understanding of respective properties, including strengths and weaknesses of the lane-changing models, and to identify potential for model improvement using existing and emerging data collection technologies. Many models have been developed in the last few decades to capture the uncertainty in lane change modeling; however, lane-changing behavior in the real world is very complex due to driver distraction (e.g., texting and cellphone or smartphone use) and environmental (e.g., pavement and lighting conditions) and geometric (e.g., horizontal and vertical curves) factors of the roadway, which have not been adequately considered in existing models. Therefore, large and detailed microscopic vehicle trajectory data sets are needed to develop new lane changing models that address these issues, and to calibrate and validate lane-changing models for representing the real world reliably. Possible measures to improve the accuracy and reliability of lane-changing models are also discussed in this paper.","authors":["Mizanur Rahman","Mashrur Chowdhury","Yuanchang Xie","Yiming He"],"meta":["December 2013IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems 14(4):1942-1956","DOI:10.1109/TITS.2013.2272074"],"references":["291292981_NGSIM_Cooperative_Lane_Changing_and_Forced_Merging_Model","279834917_Integrated_driving_behavior_modeling","275853461_Quantifying_the_Number_of_Lane_Changes_in_Traffic","266713268_Transportation_and_Traffic_Theory","261329407_Modeling_Mandatory_Lane_Changing_Using_Bayes_Classifier_and_Decision_Trees","256456929_Modeling_Cooperative_Lane-changing_and_Forced_Merging_Behavior","248987273_Driving_Behaviour_Models_and_Challenges","247899208_Lane_changing_models_A_critical_review","239439179_General_Lane-Changing_Model_MOBIL_for_Car-Following_Models","238437824_Multilane_hybrid_trac_ow_model_a_theory_on_the_impacts_of_lane-changing_maneuvers","238273645_Monograph_on_Traffic_Flow_Theory","233263123_Lane-Changing_Decision_Model_for_Heavy_Vehicle_Drivers","228904295_Modeling_Integrated_Lane-Changing_Behavior","228748555_Realistische_Mikrosimulation_von_Strassenverkehr_mit_einem_einfachen_Modell","228650849_Empirical_Study_of_Traffic_Features_at_a_Freeway_Lane_Drop","225166876_Complexity_of_Traffic_Interactions_Improving_Behavioural_Intelligence_in_Driving_Simulation_Scenarios","223735487_Integrated_driving_behavior_modeling","340914614_Lectures_On_Game_Theory","317053435_Traffic_Data_Collection_from_Aerial_Imagery","312908213_Lane_changing_on_the_motorway_factors_affecting_its_occurrence_and_their_implications","310403063_A_study_of_traffic_capacity_Proceedings_Highway_Research_Record","287584136_Models_of_freeway_lane_changing_and_gap_acceptance_behavior","284338275_A_new_technique_for_design_and_analysis_of_weaving_sections_on_freeways","284255627_Effects_of_merging_lane_length_on_the_merging_behavior_at_expressway_on-ramps","283636953_Human_factors","277436958_Integrated_Lane_Change_Model_with_Relaxation_and_Synchronization","275456425_Descriptive_Analysis_of_Light_Vehicle-Heavy_Vehicle_Interactions_from_the_Light_Vehicle_Driver's_Perspective","267981357_Evaluation_of_Integrated_Application_of_Intelligent_Transportation_Systems_ITS_Technologies_Using_Stochastic_Incident_Generation_and_Resolution_Simulation","264420972_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems_for_a_Motorway_Microscopic_Simulation_Model","260543534_Integrated_Traffic_and_Communication_Performance_Evaluation_of_an_Intelligent_Vehicle_Infrastructure_Integration_VII_System_for_Online_Travel-Time_Prediction","260184209_Integration_of_Vehicle_Infrastructure_Integration_VII_system_and_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_for_online_travel_time_prediction","258263215_CORSIM-corridor_traffic_simulation_model","256366033_Propagation_of_on-ramp_density_perturbations_on_unidirectional_two-_and_three-lane_freeways","252441109_Toward_An_Integrated_Car-following_and_Lane_changing_Model_by_A_Neural_Fuzzy_Approach","245222306_Modelling_dual_carriageway_lane_changing_using_neural_networks","242932861_Propagation_of_On-Ramp_Density_Waves_on_Uniform_Unidirectional_Multilane_Freeways","241129020_Moving_BottlenecksA_Theory_Grounded_on_Experimental_Observation","239356870_Estimation_of_time-varying_origin-destination_flows_from_traffic_counts_A_neural_network_approach","238836304_Density_Oscillations_Between_Lanes_of_a_Multilane_Highway","238228040_Estimation_of_gap_acceptance_parameters_within_and_across_the_population_from_direct_roadside_observ","230663959_Urban_Travel_Demand_A_Behavioral_Analysis","228922755_Measuring_first-in-first-out_violation_among_vehicles","227595343_Macroscopic_Modeling_of_Lane-changing_for_Two-lane_Traffic_Flow","224653838_The_Control_Mechanism_of_Lane_changing_in_Jam_Condition","224568348_Real-Time_Highway_Traffic_Condition_Assessment_Framework_Using_Vehicle-Infrastructure_Integration_VII_With_Artificial_Intelligence_AI","224562544_Research_on_Safety_Lane_Change_Model_of_Driver_Assistant_System_on_Highway","224329246_A_comparative_exploration_of_eye_gaze_and_head_motion_cues_for_lane_change_intent_prediction","224224825_Verified_hybrid_controller_for_automated_vehicles","224215182_Prediction_of_Lane_Change_Trajectories_through_Neural_Network","223655416_A_Behavioural_Car-Following_Model_for_Computer_Simulation","223582214_The_validation_of_a_microscopic_simulation_model_A_methodological_case_study","223544867_Modeling_lane_changing_and_merging_in_microscopic_traffic_simulation","223424513_Modeling_vehicle_interactions_in_microscopic_simulation_of_merging_and_weaving","223326083_A_continuum_model_for_the_dispersion_of_traffic_on_two-lane_roads","222838604_A_kinematic_wave_theory_of_lane-changing_traffic_flow"]}
