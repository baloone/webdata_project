{"id":"319474131_Emotional_interactive_movie_adjusting_the_scenario_according_to_the_emotional_response_of_the_viewer","abstract":"Emotional interactive movie is a kind of film unfolding in different ways according to the emotion the viewer experiences. The movie is made of several sequences; their combination determines the particular scenario experienced. In this paper, we describe the system and its implementation by providing combination selection criteria. We measured neurophysiological and ocular activities of 60 individuals viewing an experimental interactive short-movie composed of 12 different scenarios. For this purpose, we combined an electroencephalography headset which directly provides emotional data with an eye-tracker in order to simultaneously investigate the position of viewer’s gaze. From the collected data analysis, we propose a functional version of the emotional interactive movie, which was used in a so called “emotional cinema” during public exhibitions.","authors":["Romain Cohendet","Matthieu Perreira Da Silva","Anne-Laure Gilet","Patrick Le Callet"],"meta":["September 2017EAI Endorsed Transactions on Creative Technologies 4(10):153053","DOI:10.4108/eai.4-9-2017.153053"],"references":["281597229_Deep_Learning_vs_Kernel_Methods_Performance_for_Emotion_Prediction_in_Videos","271554907_Memorability_of_natural_scenes_The_role_of_attention","259921530_Can_you_see_me_thinking_about_my_answers_Using_eye-tracking_to_illuminate_developmental_differences_in_monitoring_and_control_skills_and_their_relation_to_performance","309201613_EEG_signal_processing","295562421_Automatic_prediction_of_emotions_induced_by_movies","285379346_LDA_Based_Emotion_Recognition_from_Lyrics","273393440_LIRIS-ACCEDE_A_video_database_for_affective_content_analysis","262240084_Emotion_Recognition_Using_the_Emotiv_EPOC_Device","232630209_Affective_computing_From_laughter_to_IEEE","231212716_How_about_Taking_a_Low-Cost_Small_and_Wireless_EEG_for_a_Walk"]}
