Using whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing in a sponge, an animal without nervous system and musculature, we identify 18 distinct cell types comprising four major families. This includes nitric-oxide sensitive contractile cells, digestive cells active in macropinocytosis, and a family of amoeboid-neuroid cells involved in innate immunity. We uncover presynaptic genes in an amoeboid-neuroid cell type, and postsynaptic genes in digestive choanocytes, suggesting asymmetric and targeted communication. Corroborating this, long neurite-like extensions from neuroid cells directly contact and enwrap choanocyte microvillar collars. Our data indicate a link between neuroid and immune functions in sponges, and suggest that a primordial neuro-immune system cleared intruders and controlled ciliary beating for feeding.","authors":["Jacob Musser","Klaske J Schippers","Michael Nickel","Giulia Mizzon"],"meta":["September 2019","DOI:10.1101/758276"],"references":["333735161_Pluripotency_and_the_origin_of_animal_multicellularity","332388679_The_architecture_of_cell_differentiation_in_choanoflagellates_and_sponge_choanocytes","326308982_Rethinking_the_Role_of_the_Nervous_System_Lessons_From_the_Hydra_Holobiont","325974189_Early_metazoan_cell_type_diversity_and_the_evolution_of_multicellular_gene_regulation","324172737_Integrating_single-cell_transcriptomic_data_across_different_conditions_technologies_and_species","323684619_Evidence_of_Signaling_and_Adhesion_Roles_for_b-Catenin_in_the_Sponge_Ephydatia_muelleri","320288737_Ctenophore_relationships_and_their_placement_as_the_sister_group_to_all_other_animals","319631141_Gut-like_ectodermal_tissue_in_a_sea_anemone_challenges_germ_layer_homology","333536126_Evolution_of_neuronal_types_and_families","323567570_Animal_Evolution_Convergent_Nerve_Cords"]}
