{"id":"259005825_Non-Binary_Evaluation_for_Schema_Matching","abstract":"In this work we extend the commonly used binary evaluation of schema matching to support evaluation methods for non-binary matching results as well. We motivate our work with some new applications of schema matching. Non-binary evaluation is formally defined together with two new, non-binary evaluation measures using a vector-space representation of schema matching outcome. We provide an empirical evaluation to support the usefulness of non-binary evaluation and show its superiority to its binary counterpart.","authors":["Tomer Sagi","Avigdor Gal"],"meta":["October 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-34002-4_37","Conference: Conceptual Modelling - ER 2012"],"references":["266871293_Matching_and_Alignment_What_Is_the_Cost_of_User_Post-Match_Effort","228972589_On_the_Stable_Marriage_of_Maximum_Weight_Royal_Couples","221549241_The_Use_of_Machine-Generated_Ontologies_in_Dynamic_Information_Seeking","221507582_A_Harmony_based_Adaptive_Ontology_Mapping_Approach","221311533_COMA_-_A_System_for_Flexible_Combination_of_Schema_Matching_Approaches","281957498_Towards_a_Generic_Approach_for_Schema_Matcher_Selection_Leveraging_User_Pre-_and_Post-match_Effort_for_Improving_Quality_and_Time_Performance","246816091_Metric_Spaces_Iteration_and_Application","235955876_Autoplex_Automated_Discovery_of_Contents_for_Virtual_Databases","226834347_Data_integration_with_uncertainty","221548986_Autoplex_Automated_Discovery_of_Content_for_Virtual_Databases"]}
