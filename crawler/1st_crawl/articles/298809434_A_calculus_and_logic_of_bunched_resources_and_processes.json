{"id":"298809434_A_calculus_and_logic_of_bunched_resources_and_processes","abstract":"Mathematical modelling and simulation modelling are fundamental tools of engineering, science, and social sciences such as economics, and provide decision-support tools in management. Mathematical models are essentially deployed at all scales, all levels of complexity, and all levels of abstraction. Models are often required to be executable, as a simulation, on a computer. We present some contributions to the process-theoretic and logical foundations of discrete-event modelling with resources and processes. Building on previous work in resource semantics, process calculus, and modal logic, we describe a process calculus with an explicit representation of resources in which processes and resources co-evolve. The calculus is closely connected to a substructural modal logic that may be used as a specification language for properties of models. In contrast to earlier work, we formulate the resource semantics, and its relationship with process calculus, in such a way that we obtain soundness and completeness of bisimulation with respect to logical equivalence for the naturally full range of logical connectives and modalities. We give a range of examples of the use of the process combinators and logical structure to describe system structure and behaviour.","authors":["G Anderson","David Pym"],"meta":["February 2016Theoretical Computer Science 614","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2015.11.035"],"references":["267449370_Compositional_Security_Modelling","228357749_Semantics_for_structured_systems_modelling_and_simulation","222683431_Separation_Logic_Semantics_of_Communicating_Processes","220388029_A_Logical_and_Computational_Theory_of_Located_Resource","27301367_Eventually_Consistent","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","226805290_Resources_Concurrency_and_Local_Reasoning","224146300_Decision_support_for_systems_security_investment","223340839_A_semantics_of_concurrent_separation_logic","222473673_Higher-level_synchronising_devices_in_Meije-SCCS","222436931_Algebra_of_communicating_processes_with_abstraction","221046764_Analysing_the_Performance_of_Security_Solutions_to_Reduce_Vulnerability_Exposure_Window","220430894_Algebraic_Laws_for_Nondeterminism_and_Concurrency","220173294_Algebra_and_logic_for_resource-based_systems_modelling","220150753_Calculi_for_Synchrony_and_Asynchrony","38373144_The_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications","3965916_Separation_logic_A_logic_for_shared_mutable_data_structures","2895661_BI_as_an_Assertion_Language_for_Mutable_Data_Structures","2558732_Possible_Worlds_and_Resources_The_Semantics_of_BI"]}
