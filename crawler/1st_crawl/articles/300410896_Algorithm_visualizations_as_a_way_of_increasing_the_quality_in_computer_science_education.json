{"id":"300410896_Algorithm_visualizations_as_a_way_of_increasing_the_quality_in_computer_science_education","abstract":"Within the paper we present the results of our recent experiments related to effectiveness of algorithm visualizations compared to standard ways of teaching algorithms and data structures. Two original software tools used in experiments and the method of assessing of their effectiveness are described. Conclusions are given, together with further possible directions of investigation within the area.","authors":["Slavomir Simonak"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1109/SAMI.2016.7422999","Conference: 2016 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics (SAMI)"],"references":["287305022_Domain_Usability_User's_Perception","273496790_Using_algorithm_visualizations_in_computer_science_education","260333462_GreedEx_A_Visualization_Tool_for_Experimentation_and_Discovery_Learning_of_Greedy_Algorithms","259998484_A_Review_of_Generic_Program_Visualization_Systems_for_Introductory_Programming_Education","230324629_An_empirical_study_on_factors_influencing_the_effectiveness_of_algorithm_visualization","220612771_Enhancing_learning_management_systems_to_better_support_computer_science_education","283770534_Haskell_clone_detection_using_pattern_comparing_algorithm","270173853_Assignment_Workflow_Support_System","261129231_Possibilities_to_solve_some_of_the_Slovak_higher_education_problems_using_information_technologies","222408779_A_Meta-Study_of_Algorithm_Visualization_Effectiveness","220688352_Software_Visualization_Visualizing_the_Structure_Behaviour_and_Evolution_of_Software","3976118_Empirical_evidence_that_algorithm_animation_promotes_understanding_of_distributed_algorithms","2372279_Designing_Effective_Algorithm_Visualizations"]}
