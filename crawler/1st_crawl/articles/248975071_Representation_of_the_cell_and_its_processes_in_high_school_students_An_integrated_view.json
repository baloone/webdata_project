{"id":"248975071_Representation_of_the_cell_and_its_processes_in_high_school_students_An_integrated_view","abstract":"This paper presents an integrated view of the ideas and conceptual problems of high school students with respect to the cell, its processes, structure and relation to the functions of multicellular organisms. The theme of cell has divided into eight topics, with a questionnaire for each topic. In these topics, different levels of representation and understanding are distinguished between general considerations about plants and animals, those connected with processes at organ and system levels and, finally, the level of cell processes. Data from 1200 students were analysed. Results show that students have an analogical mechanism that establishes an isomorphism between the representation of the functioning of multicellular organisms of cell processes. A series of problems in understanding was also shown. Results imply that these problems are mainly due to students' lack of differentiation between some processes at organism and organ level, and have important implications for learning this subject. Finally, some suggestions are made for teaching.","authors":["Fernando Flores-Camacho","Ma Eugenia Tovar","Leticia Gallegos CÃ¡zares"],"meta":["February 2003International Journal of Science Education 25(2):269-286","DOI:10.1080/09500690210126793"],"references":["254307189_Teachers'_misconceptions_of_the_circulatory_system","248974810_The_secret_life_of_the_chemical_bond_Students'_anthropomorphic_and_animistic_references_to_bonding","237700754_Calor_y_temperatura_Esquemas_alternativos_en_estudiantes_de_preparatoria","40423515_Consideraciones_sobre_la_estructura_de_las_teorias_cientificas_y_la_ensenanza_de_la_ciencia","39077085_Materia_inerte_Materia_viva_tienen_ambas_constitucion_atomica","284593960_Anthropomorphism_and_teleology_in_reasoning_about_biological_phenomena","284469107_Teaching_cell_division_Student_difficulties_and_teaching_recommendations","276974321_A-level_students_Their_problems_with_gene_and_allele","271945722_Respiration-That's_breathing_isn't_it","271945560_Confusing_chromosome_number_and_structure_A_common_student_error","271747670_A_study_of_Nigerian_pupils'_understanding_of_selected_biological_concepts","254306811_The_pupil_and_the_living_cell_A_taxonomy_of_dysfunctional_ideas_about_an_abstract_idea","254306782_Genetics_-_Are_there_inherent_learning_difficulties","248974951_Understanding_of_energy_in_biology_and_vitalistic_conceptions","248974665_The_cell_concept_of_10th_graders_Curricular_expectations_and_reality","247663007_Students''alternative_frameworks_and_science_education","241728643_All_in_the_genes-Young_people's_understanding_of_the_nature_of_genes","240526572_Photosynthesis_and_'inverse_respiration'_in_plants_An_inevitable_misconception","240526484_How_students_aged_13-15_understand_photosynthesis","234621228_Pupils_and_Paradigms_A_Review_of_Literature_Related_to_Concept_Development_in_Adolescent_Science_Students","233364506_Young_People's_Ideas_About_Plants","232843585_High_school_students'_difficulties_in_learning_biology_concepts","230528634_Partial_possible_models_An_approach_to_interpret_students'_physical_representation","229987790_Preconceptions_and_relations_used_by_children_in_the_construction_of_food_chains","229865470_A_cross-age_study_of_student_understanding_of_the_concept_of_homeostasis","229613034_Understanding_cellular_respiration_An_analysis_of_conceptual_change_in_college_biology","229507342_Understanding_a_basic_biological_process_Expert_and_novice_models_of_meiosis","228042060_Can_students_be_taught_to_distinguish_between_teleological_and_causal_explanations","39101489_Estudio_llevado_a_cabo_sobre_representaciones_de_la_respiracion_celular_en_los_alumnos_de_Bachillerato_y_COU","39093584_Las_ideas_de_los_alumnos_y_alumnas_acerca_de_la_estructura_celular_de_los_seres_vivos","39093527_Las_ideas_del_alumnado_sobre_el_concepto_de_celula_al_finalizar_la_Educacion_General_Basica","31891886_Ves_lo_que_dibujas_Observando_celulas_con_el_microscopio"]}
