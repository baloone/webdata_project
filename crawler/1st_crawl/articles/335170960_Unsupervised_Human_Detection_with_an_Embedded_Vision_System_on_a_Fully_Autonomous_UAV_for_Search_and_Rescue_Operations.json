{"id":"335170960_Unsupervised_Human_Detection_with_an_Embedded_Vision_System_on_a_Fully_Autonomous_UAV_for_Search_and_Rescue_Operations","abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a primary role in a plethora of technical and scientific fields owing to their wide range of applications. In particular, the provision of emergency services during the occurrence of a crisis event is a vital application domain where such aerial robots can contribute, sending out valuable assistance to both distressed humans and rescue teams. Bearing in mind that time constraints constitute a crucial parameter in search and rescue (SAR) missions, the punctual and precise detection of humans in peril is of paramount importance. The paper in hand deals with real-time human detection onboard a fully autonomous rescue UAV. Using deep learning techniques, the implemented embedded system was capable of detecting open water swimmers. This allowed the UAV to provide assistance accurately in a fully unsupervised manner, thus enhancing first responder operational capabilities. The novelty of the proposed system is the combination of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) techniques and computer vision algorithms for both precise human detection and rescue apparatus release. Details about hardware configuration as well as the systemâ€™s performance evaluation are fully discussed.","authors":["Eleftherios Lygouras","Nicholas Santavas","Anastasios Taitzoglou","Konstantinos Tarchanidis"],"meta":["August 2019Sensors 19(16):3542","DOI:10.3390/s19163542"],"references":["334711989_Vehicle_Detection_in_Aerial_Images_Using_a_Fast_Oriented_Region_Search_and_the_Vector_of_Locally_Aggregated_Descriptors","334004743_Real-time_Precise_Point_Positioning_with_a_Xiaomi_MI_8_Android_Smartphone","333647773_Precise_Point_Positioning_Using_World's_First_Dual-Frequency_GPSGALILEO_Smartphone","332657304_Towards_Automatic_UAS-Based_Snow-Field_Monitoring_for_Microclimate_Research","332619527_Building_Corner_Detection_in_Aerial_Images_with_Fully_Convolutional_Networks","332281773_Application_of_Deep-Learning_Methods_to_Bird_Detection_Using_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_Imagery","332075263_Multispectral_Detection_of_Commercial_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","332016577_Drone_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation_Using_Relational_Graph_Networks","331337802_EffFeu_Project_Towards_Mission-Guided_Application_of_Drones_in_Safety_and_Security_Environments","334203990_Real-Time_Human_Detection_as_an_Edge_Service_Enabled_by_a_Lightweight_CNN"]}
