{"id":"338014160_Developing_The_Pointer_Backward-Forward_Algorithm_In_Token_Of_Test_In_Text_To_Know_The_Level_Of_Individual_Depression","abstract":"The way you move and sleep, interact with people around you, depression change everything. This even looks at the way you talk and express yourself in writing. Sometimes this “depression language” can have a strong effect to others. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence, and language (linguistics) related to the interaction between computers and natural human languages, such as Indonesian or English. The main objective of the NLP study is to make a machine that is able to know and understand the meaning of language, lexical analysis has the role of reading input characters and generating output tokens and making spaces, tabs, newlines and connecting rows of programs. However, the problems will occur when lexical analyzers where lexical is not able to determine when there are misspellings on tokens. Therefore, with the development of the backward-forward pointer algorithm, it is expected that in the future it will be easier to analyze both the words in front, in the middle and behind, so that the machine can quickly determine the individual depression level of speech tokens and speech tones.","authors":["Hasanul Fahmi","Muhammad Zarlis","Zakarias Situmorang","Adli Abdillah Nababan"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1361(1):012072","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1361/1/012072"],"references":["322582680_Guided_Open_Vocabulary_Image_Captioning_with_Constrained_Beam_Search","318742146_Lexically_Constrained_Decoding_for_Sequence_Generation_Using_Grid_Beam_Search","220355462_The_Alignment_Template_Approach_to_Statistical_Machine_Translation","324600225_Fast_Lexically_Constrained_Decoding_with_Dynamic_Beam_Allocation_for_Neural_Machine_Translation","261567318_Jumping_NLP_Curves_A_Review_of_Natural_Language_Processing_Research_Review_Article"]}
