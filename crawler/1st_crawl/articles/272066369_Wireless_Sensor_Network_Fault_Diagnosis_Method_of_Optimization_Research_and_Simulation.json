{"id":"272066369_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Fault_Diagnosis_Method_of_Optimization_Research_and_Simulation","abstract":"The traditional method of wireless sensor network fault diagnosis based on linear modeling rather than actually complicated and nod-linear relationship results in error data and leads to wrong decisions, therefore, this paper presents a sensor fault diagnosis method based on ARIMA and LSSVM integration control system which used to diagnosis sensor fault whose results are input LSSVM to fusion and get the final results of fault diagnosis. The simulation test results show that the proposed method improves the sensor node fault diagnosis accuracy, reduce the false negative rate and false positive rate.","authors":["Qiang Li"],"meta":["August 2013Applied Mechanics and Materials 347-350:955-959","DOI:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.347-350.955"],"references":["225124766_A_Survey_of_Fault_Management_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222691007_Detection_and_diagnosis_of_data_inconsistency_failures_in_wireless_sensor_networks","222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey"]}
