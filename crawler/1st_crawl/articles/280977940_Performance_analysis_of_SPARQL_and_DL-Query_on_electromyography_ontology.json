{"id":"280977940_Performance_analysis_of_SPARQL_and_DL-Query_on_electromyography_ontology","abstract":"Ontology design is an important part of medical informatics to enable reusability among different ontologies at various levels. This paper presents a representation of medical knowledge in the form of EMG based neuromuscular ontological. This means, methods used to collect and formalize the development of a knowledge base are described. Descriptive part of the knowledge base is realized as an ontology and procedural knowledge realized through set of production rules. The intent of this paper is to predict relations among heterogeneous entities and retrieve suitable inferences from their properties with the help of rule based sequences. Performance analysis of various ontological tools is being analyzed to determine the suitability of method for different applications where ontologies are used as inference and browsing aids.","authors":["Aditya Khamparia","Babita Pandey"],"meta":["August 2015Indian Journal of Science and Technology Volume 8(17):1-7","DOI:10.17485/ijst/2015/v8i17/54090"],"references":["259620852_Review_on_Semantic_Web_Service_Processes","224187028_Developing_Domain-Ontologies_to_Improve_Sofware_Engineering_Knowledge","262599472_Sparql_query_language_for_rdf","251410456_Lightweight_Semantic_Web_Service_Descriptions","240410049_Web_Ontology_Language_Overview_W3C_Recommendation","227237621_Biomedical_Ontologies","222555086_OWL_Rules_A_Proposal_and_Prototype_Implementation","220468723_Spinning_the_Semantic_Web_bringing_the_World_Wide_Web_to_its_full_potential","220217641_An_integrated_intelligent_computing_model_for_the_interpretation_of_EMG_based_neuromuscular_diseases","200085976_Development_of_NASA-TLX_Task_Load_Index_Results_of_empirical_and_theoretical_research"]}
