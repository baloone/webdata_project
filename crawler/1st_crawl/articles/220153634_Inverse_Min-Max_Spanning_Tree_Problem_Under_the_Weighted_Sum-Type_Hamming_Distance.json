{"id":"220153634_Inverse_Min-Max_Spanning_Tree_Problem_Under_the_Weighted_Sum-Type_Hamming_Distance","abstract":"The inverse optimization problem is to modify the weight (or cost, length, capacity and so on) such that a given feasible\nsolution becomes an optimal solution. In this paper, we consider the inverse min-max spanning tree problem under the weighted\nsum-type Hamming distance. For the model considered, we present its combinatorial algorithm that run in strongly polynomial\ntimes.","authors":["Longcheng Liu","Enyu Yao"],"meta":["January 2008Theoretical Computer Science 396:28-34","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-74450-4_34","SourceDBLP"],"references":["227333991_Some_inverse_min-max_network_problems_under_weighted_l_1_and_l_norms_with_bound_constraints_on_changes","221426495_Some_New_Results_on_Inverse_Sorting_Problems","256181586_The_min-max_spanning_tree_problem_and_some_extensions","225367682_Constrained_Inverse_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problems_under_the_Bottleneck-Type_Hamming_Distance","220089506_The_Center_Location_Improvement_Problem_Under_the_Hamming_Distance","220089378_Weighted_Inverse_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problems_Under_Hamming_Distance","220089254_Inverse_Combinatorial_Optimization_A_Survey_on_Problems_Methods_and_Results","220089237_Inverse_maximum_flow_problems_under_the_weighted_Hamming_distance","23551514_Weighted_inverse_minimum_cut_problem_under_the_bottleneck-type_Hamming_distance","2364870_Inverse_Optimization_A_Survey_on_Problems_Methods_and_Results"]}
