{"id":"332592567_Approaches_to_Assess_Computational_Thinking_Competences_Based_on_Code_Analysis_in_K-12_Education_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","abstract":"As computing has become an integral part of our world, demand for teaching computational thinking in K-12 has increased. One of its basic competences is programming, often taught by learning activities without a predefined solution using block-based visual programming languages. Automatic assessment tools can support teachers with their assessment and grading as well as guide students throughout their learning process. Although being already widely used in higher education, it remains unclear if such approaches exist for K-12 computing education. Thus, in order to obtain an overview, we performed a systematic mapping study. We identified 14 approaches, focusing on the analysis of the code created by the students inferring computational thinking competencies related to algorithms and programming. However, an evident lack of consensus on the assessment criteria and instructional feedback indicates the need for further research to support a wide application of computing education in K-12 schools.","authors":["Nathalia da Cruz Alves","Christiane Gresse von Wangenheim","Jean Carlo Rossa Hauck"],"meta":["April 2019Informatics in Education 18(1):17-39","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2019.02","Project: K-12 Computing Education - Computação na Escola"],"references":["319959476_Demystifying_computational_thinking","317090391_Analysis_of_Scratch_Projects_of_an_Introductory_Programming_Course_for_Primary_School_Students","316613934_On_the_Automatic_Assessment_of_Computational_Thinking_Skills_A_Comparison_with_Human_Experts","312039564_Developing_Computational_Thinking_in_Compulsory_Education_Implications_for_policy_and_practice","336573400_Systematic_Mapping_Studies_in_Software_Engineering","324762596_CodeMaster_-_Automatic_Assessment_and_Grading_of_App_Inventor_and_Snap_Programs","316945963_Sniffing_Through_Millions_of_Blocks_for_Bad_Smells","314191072_Assessing_elementary_students'_computational_thinking_in_everyday_reasoning_and_robotics_programming","313452636_An_Online_Peer_Assessment-Based_Programming_Approach_to_Improving_Students'_Programming_Knowledge_and_Skills","313196550_Assessment_and_classroom_learning_Assessment_in_education_Principles"]}
