{"id":"261615055_Maximising_Gain_for_Minimal_Pain_Utilising_Natural_Game_Mechanics","abstract":"This paper considers the application of natural games mechanics within higher education as a vehicle to encourage student engagement and achievement of desired learning outcomes. It concludes with desiderata of features for a learning environment when used for assessment and a reflection on the gap between current and aspired learning provision. The context considered is higher (tertiary) education, where the aims are both to improve students’ engagement with course content and also to bring about potential changes in the students’ learning behaviour.\n\nWhilst traditional approaches to teaching and learning may focus on dealing with large classes, where the onus is frequently on efficiency and on the effectiveness of feedback in improving understanding and future performance, intelligent systems can provide technology to enable alternative methods that can cope with large classes that preserve the cost benefits. However, such intelligent systems may also offer improved learning outcomes via a personalised learning experience.\n\nThis paper looks to exploit particular properties which emerge from the game playing process and seek to engage them in a wider educational context. In particular we aim to use game engagement and flow as natural dynamics that can be exploited in the learning experience.\n\nRead More: http://journals.heacademy.ac.uk/doi/abs/","authors":["Neil A.
