{"id":"291138160_Assessing_value_classification_of_oil_and_gas_reserve_based_on_support_vector_machine","abstract":"Based on the characteristics of oil and gas reserve, value classification of oil and gas reserve was assessed. Seven factors influencing value classification of oil and gas reserve were chosen, which were reserve scale, reserve abundance, reserve depth, oil viscosity, permeability, freezing point and recovery ratio. Least square support vector machine model was applied to simulate value degradation of oil and gas reserve. The parameters of penalty factor C and kernel function parameter Ïƒ can be decided by grid searching method. The results show that least square support vector machine is a valid method in the value classification of oil and gas reserve. The right rate of training is up to 95% and the right rate of testing is up to 81%.","authors":["L. Yang","H.-Z. Wang","Z.-L.
