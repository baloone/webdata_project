{"id":"321037517_Query_Optimal_k-Plex_Based_Community_in_Graphs","abstract":"Community search problem, which is to find good communities given a set of query nodes in a graph, has attracted increasing research interest recently. Though various measurement models have been proposed to define and solve community search problem. Few of them could define a community concisely and have good quality of query results. They either involve additional constraints for modeling communities, such as size and diameter, or suffer from the free rider effect, i.e., include irrelevant subgraphs. In this paper, we propose a new k-plex based community model for community search. We show that our model not only is simple and clear, but also meets with basic requirements of defining a community search problem. We formulate the maximum k-plex community query (MCKPQ) problem, that is, given a set of query nodes Q, searching for optimal k-plex containing Q. We prove that MCKPQ is NP-hard, and it is hard to approximate in any constant factor. We first give exact solutions. Then, we propose an efficient branch-and-bound (B&B) method and design an effective upper bound function and a pruning strategy. Furthermore, we optimize the basic B&B by fast candidate generation. We also give a fast heuristic solution, which produces high-quality results in practice. The effectiveness of our model of community and the efficiency of our methods are verified by elaborate experiments.","authors":["Yue Wang","Xun Jian","Zhenhua Yang","Jia Li"],"meta":["December 2017Data Science and Engineering 2(3)","DOI:10.1007/s41019-017-0051-3"],"references":["301873072_Evolution_of_worldwide_stock_markets_correlation_structure_and_correlation_based_graphs","277144913_Approximate_Closest_Community_Search_in_Networks","273057422_Influential_community_search_in_large_networks","312600697_Algorithm_457_Finding_all_cliques_of_an_undirected_graph","305067206_The_K-clique_Densest_Subgraph_Problem","300590376_Efficient_Enumeration_of_Maximal_k-Plexes","283738615_Resolution_limit_in_community_detection","278666842_Efficient_and_Effective_Community_Search","276535732_Robust_local_community_detection","266660377_On_social_event_organization"]}
