{"id":"316865342_Simulation_of_AADL_models_with_software-in-the-loop_execution","abstract":"In this paper we consider a problem of simulation of avionics models with heterogeneously specified behaviours of components. In particular, we consider a situation when some software components of a model are specified by a program code of ARINC653 partitions but the rest of a model is defined in a very abstract way. One approach of behavioural and time analysis of such models is described in this paper.","authors":["Denis Buzdalov"],"meta":["May 2017ACM SIGAda Ada Letters 36(2):49-53","DOI:10.1145/3092893.3092902"],"references":["287544855_Tools_for_System_Design_of_Integrated_Modular_Avionics","289219086_A_discrete-event_simulator_for_early_validation_of_avionics_systems","262169803_Model-based_software_in-the-loop-test_of_autonomous_systems","228978076_A_framework_for_real-time_utilities_for_Ada_2005","4053783_SPADES_-_a_distributed_agent_simulation_environment_with_software-in-the-loop_execution"]}
