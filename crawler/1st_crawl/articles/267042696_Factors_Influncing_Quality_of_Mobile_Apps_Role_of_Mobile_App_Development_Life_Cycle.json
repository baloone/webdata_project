{"id":"267042696_Factors_Influncing_Quality_of_Mobile_Apps_Role_of_Mobile_App_Development_Life_Cycle","abstract":"In this paper, The mobile application field has been receiving astronomical\nattention from the past few years due to the growing number of mobile app\ndownloads and withal due to the revenues being engendered .With the surge in\nthe number of apps, the number of lamentable apps/failing apps has withal been\ngrowing.Interesting mobile app statistics are included in this paper which\nmight avail the developers understand the concerns and merits of mobile\napps.The authors have made an effort to integrate all the crucial factors that\ncause apps to fail which include negligence by the developers, technical\nissues, inadequate marketing efforts, and high prospects of the\nusers/consumers.The paper provides suggestions to eschew failure of apps. As\nper the various surveys, the number of lamentable/failing apps is growing\nenormously, primarily because mobile app developers are not adopting a standard\ndevelopment life cycle for the development of apps. In this paper, we have\ndeveloped a mobile application with the aid of traditional software development\nlife cycle phases (Requirements, Design, Develop, Test, and, Maintenance) and\nwe have used UML, M-UML, and mobile application development technologies.","authors":["Venkata N.
