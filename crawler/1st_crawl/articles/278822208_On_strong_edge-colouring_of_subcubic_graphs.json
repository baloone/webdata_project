{"id":"278822208_On_strong_edge-colouring_of_subcubic_graphs","abstract":"A strong edge-colouring of a graph G is a proper edge-colouring such that every path of length 3 uses three different colours. In this paper we improve some previous results on the strong edge-colouring of subcubic graphs by showing that every subcubic graph with maximum average degree strictly less than 73 (resp. 52, 83, 207) can be strongly edge-coloured with six (resp. seven, eight, nine) colours. These upper bounds are optimal except the one of 83. Also, we prove that every subcubic planar graph without 4-cycles and 5-cycles can be strongly edge-coloured with nine colours.","authors":["Hervé Hocquard","Mickael Montassier","André Raspaud","Petru Valicov"],"meta":["November 2013Discrete Applied Mathematics 161(16)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2013.05.021"],"references":["221036596_Strong_Edge_Coloring_for_Channel_Assignment_in_Wireless_Radio_Networks","3334164_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multihop_Radio_Networks","2125429_A_Strong_Edge-Coloring_of_Graphs_with_Maximum_Degree_4_Using_22_Colors","294486880_Problems_and_Results_in_Combinatorial_Analysis_and_Graph_Theory","268643161_Strong_edge-coloring_of_cubic_planar_graphs","268635787_Strong_edge-colorings_of_graphs_and_applications_to_multi_k-gons","244514149_The_strong_chromatic_index_of_graphs","229706634_Induced_matchings_in_cubic_graphs","222481215_The_maximum_number_of_edges_in_2K","221244649_A_Unified_Framework_and_Algorithm_for_TFCDMA_Channel_Assignment_in_Wireless_Networks","221164086_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multi-Hop_Radio_Networks","220570646_Strong_edge_coloring_of_subcubic_graphs","220194195_Problems_and_Results_in_Combinatorial_Analysis_and_Graph_Theory","220191815_The_strong_chromatic_index_of_a_cubic_graph_is_at_most_10","220076949_Monochromatic_sumsets","2638654_Achieving_MAC_Layer_Fairness_in_Wireless_Packet_Networks"]}
