{"id":"301856559_Blind_fluorescence_structured_illumination_microscopy_A_new_reconstruction_strategy","abstract":"In this communication, a fast reconstruction algorithm is proposed for fluorescence \\textit{blind} structured illumination microscopy (SIM) under the sample positivity constraint. This new algorithm is by far simpler and faster than existing solutions, paving the way to 3D and/or real-time 2D reconstruction.","authors":["Simon Labouesse","Marc Allain","Jérôme Idier","S.
