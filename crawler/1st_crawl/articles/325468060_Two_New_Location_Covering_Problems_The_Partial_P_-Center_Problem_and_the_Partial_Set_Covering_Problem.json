{"id":"325468060_Two_New_Location_Covering_Problems_The_Partial_P_-Center_Problem_and_the_Partial_Set_Covering_Problem","abstract":"Two new covering problems are introduced. The partial covering P‚Äêcenter problem minimizes a coverage distance in such a way that a given fraction of the population is covered. The partial set covering problem seeks the minimum number of facilities needed to cover an exogenously specified fraction of the population within a given coverage distance. The problems are formulated as integer linear programming problems. Bisection search algorithms are outlined for the two problems. The search algorithm repeatedly solves a Lagrangian relaxation of the maximal covering problem. Computational results for the Lagrangian relaxation of the maximal covering problem and for the bisection search algorithms are presented on problems with up to 150 nodes.","authors":["Mark S.
