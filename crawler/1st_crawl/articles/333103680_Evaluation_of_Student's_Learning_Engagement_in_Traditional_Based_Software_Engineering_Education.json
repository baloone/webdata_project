{"id":"333103680_Evaluation_of_Student's_Learning_Engagement_in_Traditional_Based_Software_Engineering_Education","abstract":"Software Engineering courses are center part of the computer science program because it tune up the software engineers for the industry needs. Whereas the major endeavour of such module is to give students hands-on industry-pertinent \"software engineering\" in the great acquaintance, usually such courses drop short of this considerable objective owed to be short of industrial awareness and hold up infrastructure. Learning analytics make easier to improve the learning process via checking the students' engagement in their learning process. This paper discusses learning engagement of the software engineering students and motivates their knowledge acquisition in software engineering education.","authors":["Nidyanandan Pratheesh","Devi Thirupathi"],"meta":["May 2019"],"references":["220424875_Intelligent_Interactive_Video_Simulation_of_a_Code_Inspection","222393024_A_qualitative_empirical_study_of_case_tool_support_to_method_learning","220475131_Teaching_Software_Evolution_in_Open_Source","4260737_Preparing_Software_Engineering_Graduates_for_an_Industry_Career","3246770_Prospects_for_an_Engineering_Discipline_of_Software"]}
