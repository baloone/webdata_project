{"id":"328145335_From_Affective_Science_to_Psychiatric_Disorder_Ontology_as_a_Semantic_Bridge","abstract":"Advances in emotion and affective science have yet to translate routinely into psychiatric research and practice. This is unfortunate since emotion and affect are fundamental components of many psychiatric conditions. Rectifying this lack of interdisciplinary integration could thus be a potential avenue for improving psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. In this contribution, we propose and discuss an ontological framework for explicitly capturing the complex interrelations between affective entities and psychiatric disorders, in order to facilitate mapping and integration between affective science and psychiatric diagnostics. We build on and enhance the categorisation of emotion, affect and mood within the previously developed Emotion Ontology, and that of psychiatric disorders in the Mental Disease Ontology. This effort further draws on developments in formal ontology regarding the distinction between normal and abnormal in order to formalize the interconnections. This operational semantic framework is relevant for applications including clarifying psychiatric diagnostic categories, clinical information systems, and the integration and translation of research results across disciplines.","authors":["Rasmus Rosenberg Larsen","Janna Hastings"],"meta":["October 2018Frontiers in Psychiatry 9","DOI:10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00487"],"references":["324788350_High-fat_diet_induces_depression-like_behaviour_in_mice_associated_with_changes_in_microbiome_neuropeptide_Y_and_brain_metabolome","323463076_Caffeine_and_Modafinil_Ameliorate_the_Neuroinflammation_and_Anxious_Behavior_in_Rats_during_Sleep_Deprivation_by_Inhibiting_the_Microglia_Activation","323396528_Genome-wide_Association_Study_of_Dimensional_Psychopathology_Using_Electronic_Health_Records","319499162_Moving_Forward_Challenges_and_Directions_for_Psychopathological_Network_Theory_and_Methodology","317821320_Why_Psychiatric_Research_Must_Abandon_Traditional_Diagnostic_Classification_and_Adopt_a_Fully_Dimensional_Scope_Two_Solutions_to_a_Persistent_Problem","333190257_Applied_Ontology_An_Introduction","325320998_Enhancing_Psychosis-Spectrum_Nosology_Through_an_International_Data_Sharing_Initiative","323563164_Individuals_with_more_severe_depression_fail_to_sustain_nucleus_accumbens_activity_to_preferred_music_over_time","322620259_A_paradigm_shift_in_psychiatric_classification_the_Hierarchical_Taxonomy_Of_Psychopathology_HiTOP","321641206_Three_Approaches_to_Understanding_and_Classifying_Mental_Disorder_ICD-11_DSM-5_and_the_National_Institute_of_Mental_Health's_Research_Domain_Criteria_RDoC"]}
