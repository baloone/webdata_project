{"id":"334579430_Interdisciplinary_Computer_Science_Pre-service_TeacherPreparation_Panel","abstract":"Many researchers [1] recognize that great Computer Science (CS) teaching demands great pedagogy, technology, and subject knowledge. It is believed that without a focus on teachers, which are the connection between schools, universities, and work, and their preparation the gap in CS knowledge will be difficult to close [2] and the support to curricular indications, as the national curriculum for computing in England, Computer Science Principles, CS 10K, CS for All, CSTA, Scientix, will not sustainable. World-spread projects as Computing At School, Mobile Computer Science Principles or Initial Teacher Education Lab emphasize the role of teachers in reaching students, sustaining their daily practice. International initiatives as code.org, CoderDojo, Code Club are great examples of well propagated curricular, pedagogical and technological innovations in education. Beside this the research effort has produced many block-based programming languages, tools, and technologies \"Low floor and high ceiling\". With this deluge of content, pedagogical and technological innovations there is the necessity to involve and sustain teachers in getting confidence with CS. Ways to accomplish this will be discussed.","authors":["Francesco Maiorana","Gretchen Richards","Chery Lucarelli","Miles Berry"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3304221.3325543","Conference: the 2019 ACM Conference"],"references":["317989563_International_Perspectives_on_CS_Teacher_Formation_and_Professional_Development","305140678_A_K-6_Computational_Thinking_Curriculum_Framework_Implications_for_Teacher_Knowledge","301463457_Usability_and_Usage_of_Interactive_Features_in_an_Online_Ebook_for_CS_Teachers","326918129_Evaluating_the_Efficiency_and_Effectiveness_of_Adaptive_Parsons_Problems","320850846_Solving_parsons_problems_versus_fixing_and_writing_code"]}
