{"id":"230859110_Tractable_Optimization_Problems_through_Hypergraph-Based_StructuralRestrictions","abstract":"Several variants of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem have been proposed\nand investigated in the literature for modelling those scenarios where\nsolutions are associated with some given costs. Within these frameworks\ncomputing an optimal solution is an NP-hard problem in general; yet, when\nrestricted over classes of instances whose constraint interactions can be\nmodelled via (nearly-)acyclic graphs, this problem is known to be solvable in\npolynomial time. In this paper, larger classes of tractable instances are\nsingled out, by discussing solution approaches based on exploiting hypergraph\nacyclicity and, more generally, structural decomposition methods, such as\n(hyper)tree decompositions.","authors":["Georg Gottlob","Gianluigi Greco","Francesco Scarcello"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-02930-1_2","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming"],"references":["263355594_Extending_to_Soft_and_Preference_Constraints_a_Framework_for_Solving_Efficiently_Structured_Problems","221633109_Bounded_Backtracking_for_the_Valued_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","221603854_Exploiting_Tree_Decomposition_and_Soft_Local_Consistency_In_Weighted_CSP","221445064_On_the_complexity_of_combinatorial_auctions_structured_item_graphs_and_hypertree_decomposition","220543018_Pure_Nash_Equilibria_Hard_and_Easy_Games","220432198_Degrees_of_Acyclicity_for_Hypergraphs_and_Relational_Database_Schemes","220202469_Semiring-Based_CSPs_and_Valued_CSPs_Frameworks_Properties_and_Comparison","200034411_The_Complexity_of_Acyclic_Conjunctive_Queries","200034389_On_the_Desirability_of_Acyclic_Database_Schemes","200034379_Algorithms_for_Acyclic_Database_Schemes","44098343_Generalized_Hypertree_Decompositions_NP-Hardness_and_Tractable_Variants","3785081_Complexity_of_acyclic_conjunctive_queries","324289824_Foundations_of_Constraint_Satisfaction","313627189_Valued_constraint_satisfaction_problems_hard_and_easy_problems","292798381_Backtracking_techniques_for_constraint_satisfaction_problems","286195972_Constraint_Processing","277473416_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Small_Treewidth","265579658_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","251470841_Chapter_4_Constraint_Programming","223633905_Bounded_treewidth_as_a_key_to_tractability_of_knowledge_representation_and_reasoning","223108082_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","222672461_Unifying_tree_decompositions_for_reasoning_in_graphical_models","222562800_Conjunctive_query_containment_revisited","222534150_Comparison_of_structural_CSP_decomposition_methods","222301712_A_unified_theory_of_structural_tractability_for_constraint_satisfaction_problems","221590847_Undirected_ST-connectivity_in_log-space","221444828_Computing_pure_nash_equilibria_in_graphical_games_via_markov_random_fields","221025071_Uniform_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems_and_Database_Theory","220815749_Non-Binary_Constraints_and_Optimal_Dual-Graph_Representations","220779769_Constraint_Solving_via_Fractional_Edge_Covers","220690138_Foundations_of_Constraint_Satisfaction","220617927_Simple_Linear-Time_Algorithms_to_Test_Chordality_of_Graphs_Test_Acyclicity_of_Hypergraphs_and_Selectively_Reduce_Acyclic_Hypergraphs","220616746_Power_of_Natural_Semijoins","220573349_Robbers_Marshals_and_Guards_Game_Theoretic_and_Logical_Characterizations_of_Hypertree_Width","220430372_Undirected_connectivity_in_log-space","220296548_Hypertree_width_and_related_hypergraph_invariants","220137917_Undirected_ST-Connectivity_in_Log-Space","220075087_Graph_minors_III_Planar_tree-width","200034147_Hypertree_Decompositions_and_Tractable_Queries"]}
