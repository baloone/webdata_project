The consequences derived in this paper are unification and generalization of the comparable consequences in the literature on midpoint inequalities.","authors":["Muhammad Aamir Ali","Necmettin Alp","HÃ¼seyin Budak","Yuming Chu"],"meta":["June 2021Open Mathematics 19(1):427-439","DOI:10.1515/math-2021-0015"],"references":["349203100_Quantum_Ostrowski-type_integral_inequalities_for_functions_of_two_variables","348660303_New_quantum_boundaries_for_quantum_Simpson's_and_quantum_Newton's_type_inequalities_for_preinvex_functions","348549627_C-2021-Some_trapezoid_and_midpoint_type_inequalities_for_newly_defined_quantum_integrals","348323500_Quantum_variant_of_Montgomery_identity_and_Ostrowski-type_inequalities_for_the_mappings_of_two_variables","347303596_Some_new_Simpson's_type_inequalities_for_coordinated_convex_functions_in_quantum_calculus","343071701_Simpson_and_Newton_type_inequalities_for_convex_functions_via_newly_defined_quantum_integrals","343049408_Some_New_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_Like_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions","342643486_Some_New_Simpson's_type_inequalities_for_co-ordinated_convex_functions_in_quantum_calculus","342411056_QUANTUM_HERMITE-HADAMARD_TYPE_INEQUALITIES_FOR_FUNCTIONS_WHOSE_SECOND_q_b_-DERIVATIVES_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_ARE_CONVEX","339825307_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_inequality_by_means_of_a_Green_function"]}
