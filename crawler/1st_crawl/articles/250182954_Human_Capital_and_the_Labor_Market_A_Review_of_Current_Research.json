{"id":"250182954_Human_Capital_and_the_Labor_Market_A_Review_of_Current_Research","abstract":"Several studies have investigated survey data on the prevalence of on-the-job training. These studies have sought to discover who receives training and the effects of this labor market experience on workers' wages, wage growth, turnover, and employment. What is the magnitude of workers' and employers' investments in job training? How profitable are such investments? The first part of the article considers these questions. The second reviews studies that provide recent measures of technological change by industry, such as productivity growth indexes or research and development expenditures. The studies explore effects of technological changes on demands for educated and trained workers and on consequent changes in wage structures, labor turnover, and unemployment.","authors":["Jacob Mincer"],"meta":["May 1989Educational Researcher 18(4)","DOI:10.2307/1176648"],"references":[]}
