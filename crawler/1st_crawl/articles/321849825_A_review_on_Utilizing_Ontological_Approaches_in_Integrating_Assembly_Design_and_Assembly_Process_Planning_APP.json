{"id":"321849825_A_review_on_Utilizing_Ontological_Approaches_in_Integrating_Assembly_Design_and_Assembly_Process_Planning_APP","abstract":"This review paper is focusing on utilizing ontological approaches in capturing and sharing assembly design knowledge towards better integration between the product design and manufacturing, more specifically between assembly design and assembly process planning (APP) domains. Most of the significant Approaches that have been proposed by researchers in the last decade are reported in this extended review paper. Comparison between various approaches and conclusion about the overall related literature are conducted as well.","authors":["Baha Hasan","Jan Wikander"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.14445/23488360/IJME-V4I11P102","Project: Semantic Integration Between Assembly Design and Assembly Process Planning using knowledge-based system"],"references":["314567583_Toward_Generic_Immersive_and_Collaborative_Solutions_to_the_Data_Interoperability_Problem_which_Target_End-Users","312410531_Product_design_and_manufacturing_process_based_ontology_for_manufacturing_knowledge_reuse","311479295_Assembly_Design_Semantic_Recognition_Using_SolidWorks-API","302937543_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications","319944310_Ontology_Model_for_Assembly_Process_Planning_Knowledge","319394161_Resource_Description_Framework_RDF_Model_and_Syntax_Specification","299840766_A_Spatiotemporal_Mereotopology-Based_Theory_for_Qualitative_Description_in_Assembly_Design_and_Sequence_Planning","292340902_Web_Ontology_Language_OWL","284137294_Requirements_and_languages_for_the_semantic_representation_of_manufacturing_systems","278050346_A_formal_ontology-based_spatiotemporal_mereotopology_for_integrated_product_design_and_assembly_sequence_planning"]}
