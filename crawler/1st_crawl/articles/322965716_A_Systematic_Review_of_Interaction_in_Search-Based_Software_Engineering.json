{"id":"322965716_A_Systematic_Review_of_Interaction_in_Search-Based_Software_Engineering","abstract":"Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) has been successfully applied to automate a wide range of software development activities. Nevertheless, in those software engineering problems where human evaluation and preference are crucial, such insights have proved difficult to characterize in search, and solutions might not look natural when that is the expectation. In an attempt to address this, an increasing number of researchers have reported the incorporation of the ‘human-in-the-loop’ during search and interactive SBSE has attracted significant attention recently. However, reported results are fragmented over different development phases, and a great variety of novel interactive approaches and algorithmic techniques have emerged. To better integrate these results, we have performed a systematic literature review of interactive SBSE. From a total of 669 papers, 26 primary studies were identified. To enable their analysis, we formulated a classification scheme focused on four crucial aspects of interactive search, i.e. the problem formulation, search technique, interactive approach, and the empirical framework. Our intention is that the classification scheme affords a methodological approach for interactive SBSE. Lastly, as well as providing a detailed cross analysis, we identify and discuss some open issues and potential future trends for the research community.","authors":["Aurora Ramírez","José Raúl
