{"id":"312132413_Designing_Online_Asynchronous_Information_Literacy_Instruction_Using_the_ADDIE_Model","abstract":"To accommodate information literacy instruction for a large undergraduate population in the face of declining faculty and staff numbers, the University of South Florida Tampa Libraryâ€™s instruction team embarked on a program to transition the first-year composition program to a series of online, course-embedded instructional modules. After reviewing several design models, the team selected the ADDIE model for instructional design and development. Ultimately, the team produced four interactive, asynchronous information literacy modules that allow students to access and complete at their own pace and at the time and location they desire.","authors":["M.
