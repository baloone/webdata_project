{"id":"290130612_Spherical_k-Means_Clustering","abstract":"k-means clustering (KM) algorithm, also called hard c-means clustering (HCM) algorithm, is a very powerful clustering algorithm [1, 2], but it has a serious problem of strong initial value dependence. To decrease the dependence, Arthur and Vassilvitskii proposed an algorithm of k-means++ clustering (KM++) algorithm on 2007 [3]. By the way, there are many case that each object is allocated on an unit sphere, e.g. text clustering. Dhillon and Modha proposed the primitive spherical k-means clustering algorithm to classify such objects on 2007 [4] and Honik, Kober, and Buchta proposed new spherical k-means clustering (SKM) algorithm on 2012 [5]. However, both of the algorithms also have the same problem of initial value dependence as KM. Therefore, the paper discuss the following points: (1) the dissimilarity of SKM is extended to satisfy the triangle inequality, and (2) spherical k-means++ clustering (SKM++) algorithm which works well for the problem is proposed. The paper shows that the effectiveness of SKM++ is theoretically guaranteed.","authors":["Yasunori Endo","Sadaaki Miyamoto"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-23240-9_9","Conference: Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["283428234_Spherical_k-Means_Clustering","292262674_Some_methods_for_classification_and_analysis_of_multivariate_observations","284686912_k-means_the_advantages_of_careful_seeding_In_Proceedings_of_the_Eighteenth_Annual_ACM-SIAM_Symposium_on_Discrete_Algorithms_New_Orleans_SIAM_pp_1027-1035","247678064_Sur_la_division_des_corp_materiels_en_parties","224839970_Some_Methods_for_Classification_and_Analysis_of_MultiVariate_Observations","220778887_K-Means_The_Advantages_of_Careful_Seeding","2801245_Concept_Decompositions_for_Large_Sparse_Text_Data_Using_Clustering"]}
