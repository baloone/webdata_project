{"id":"308873078_Experimental_comparison_of_DPC_and_VOC_control_of_a_three-level_NPC_grid_connected_converter","abstract":"This paper presents the principle of Direct Power Control (DPC) and Voltage Oriented Control (VOC) for a three-level Neutral point clamped (NPC) grid connected inverter. Considering balancing of the neutral point, a switching table with neutral point voltage control is derived for DPC. The two control algorithms are successfully implemented in a test bench, and an experimental comparison is conducted including dynamic performance and harmonics analysis in steady state. The equivalent switching frequency concept is introduced for DPC to guarantee a switching frequency comparable to VOC.","authors":["Hang Yin","S.
