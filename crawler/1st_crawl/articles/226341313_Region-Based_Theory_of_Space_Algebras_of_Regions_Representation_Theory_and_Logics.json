{"id":"226341313_Region-Based_Theory_of_Space_Algebras_of_Regions_Representation_Theory_and_Logics","abstract":"In this paper, we present recent results in the region-based theory of space that concern algebras of regions, the corresponding\ntopological and discrete models, and representation theory. We also discuss applications to Qualitative Spatial Reasoning\n(QSR), an actively developing branch of AI and Knowledge Representation (KR). In particular, we show how new results in some\npractically motivated areas of QSR and KR can be obtained by combining methods from such established classical disciplines\nas Boolean algebras, topology and logic.","authors":["Dimiter Vakarelov"],"meta":["July 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-0-387-69245-6_6","In book: Mathematical Problems from Applied Logic II (pp.267-348)"],"references":["330422421_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","330422013_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_A_Proximity_Approach-I","345832007_Proximity_Spaces","344486660_Modal_Logic","296817003_Special_issue_on_Qualitative_spatial_reasoning_-_Preface","291050271_Les_fondements_de_la_geometrie_des_corps","285350971_Point_line_and_surface_as_sets_of_solids","284881103_Boundedness_in_a_topological_space","284667632_Individuals_and_points","284150994_The_representation_of_Boolean_algebras"]}
