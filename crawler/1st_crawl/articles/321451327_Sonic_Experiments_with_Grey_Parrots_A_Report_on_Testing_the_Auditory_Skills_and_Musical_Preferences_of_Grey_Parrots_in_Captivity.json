{"id":"321451327_Sonic_Experiments_with_Grey_Parrots_A_Report_on_Testing_the_Auditory_Skills_and_Musical_Preferences_of_Grey_Parrots_in_Captivity","abstract":"This report documents a series of experiments towards the development of acoustically enriched environments through sonic interfaces and musical instruments for grey parrots living in captivity. These investigations intend to lead to a better understanding of how grey parrots perceive, respond to, and generate sound and music through the usage of technological mediators, with the aim to improve their quality of life.","authors":["Reinhard Gupfinger","Martin Kaltenbrunner"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3152130.3152137","Conference: the Fourth International Conference","Project: AR349-G24 metamusic"],"references":["272083044_Searching_for_the_origins_of_musicality_across_species","239541486_The_grey_parrot_Psittacus_erithacus_as_musician_an_experiment_with_the_Temperate_Scale","24396607_Experimental_Evidence_for_Synchronization_to_a_Musical_Beat_in_a_Nonhuman_Animal","312190480_Cognitive_and_communicative_abilities_of_grey_parrots","257626419_Touch_screen_device_and_music_as_enrichments_to_captive_housing_conditions_of_African_grey_parrots","222187494_Common_disorders_of_amazons_Australian_Parakeets_and_African_Grey_Parrots","24396603_Spontaneous_Motor_Entrainment_to_Music_in_Multiple_Vocal_Mimicking_Species","7181519_The_Evolution_of_Music_in_Comparative_Perspective"]}
