In this paper, we show that determining whether a particular graph has a weighting of the edges from \\1, 2\\ that induces a proper vertex coloring is NP-complete.","authors":["Andrzej Dudek","David Wajc"],"meta":["November 2011Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS 13(3):45-50","DOI:10.46298/dmtcs.548","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220075635_Vertex-coloring_edge-weightings_Towards_the_1-2-3-conjecture","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","226963348_On_vertex-coloring_13-edge-weighting","220570958_Degree_constrained_subgraphs","220441404_Vertex-Colouring_Edge-Weightings"]}
