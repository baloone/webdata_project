{"id":"262884749_Locally_optimal_extracellular_stimulation_for_chaotic_desynchronization_of_neural_populations","abstract":"We use optimal control theory to design a methodology to find locally optimal stimuli for desynchronization of a model of neurons with extracellular stimulation. This methodology yields stimuli which lead to positive Lyapunov exponents, and hence desynchronizes a neural population. We analyze this methodology in the presence of interneuron coupling to make predictions about the strength of stimulation required to overcome synchronizing effects of coupling. This methodology suggests a powerful alternative to pulsatile stimuli for deep brain stimulation as it uses less energy than pulsatile stimuli, and could eliminate the time consuming tuning process.","authors":["Dan Wilson","Jeff Moehlis"],"meta":["June 2014Journal of Computational Neuroscience 37(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10827-014-0499-3","SourcePubMed"],"references":["241603170_Desynchronization_by_Means_of_a_Coordinated_Reset_of_Neural_Sub-Populations_---A_Novel_Technique_for_Demand-Controlled_Deep_Brain_Stimulation","238883047_Charge-balanced_spike_timing_control_for_phase_models_of_spiking_neurons","322051271_Neurons_in_the_globus_pallidus_do_not_show_correlated_activity_in_the_normal_monkey_but_phase-locked_oscillations_appear_in_the_MPTP_model_of_parkinsonism","316799009_Interdisciplinary_Applied_Mathematics","301233065_Biological_rhythms_and_the_behavior_of_populations_of_coupled_oscillators","283617477_Stochastic_Runge-Kutta_algorithms_I_White_noise","270309504_The_Geometry_of_Biological_Time","266173914_Optimal_Chaotic_Desynchronization_for_Neural_Populations","265525467_Phase_Resetting_in_Medicine_and_Biology_Stochastic_Modelling_and_Data_Analysis","238186641_Simulating_Analyzing_and_Animating_Dynamical_Systems_A_Guide_to_XPPAUT_for_Researchers_and_Students"]}
