{"id":"348087672_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue_on_AI_Fairness_Trust_and_Ethics","abstract":"It is our pleasure to welcome you to this AIS Transactions on Human Computer Interaction special issue on artificial intelligence (AI) fairness, trust, and ethics. This special issue received research papers that unpacked the potential, challenges, impacts, and theoretical implications of AI. This special issue contains four papers that integrate research across diverse fields of study, such as social science, computer science, engineering, design, values, and other diverse topics related to AI fairness, trust, and ethics broadly conceptualized. This issue contains three of the four papers (along with a regular paper of the journal). The fourth or last paper of this special issue is forthcoming in March 2021. We hope that you enjoy these papers and, like us, look forward to similar research published in AIS Transactions on Human Computer Interaction.","authors":["Lionel P.
