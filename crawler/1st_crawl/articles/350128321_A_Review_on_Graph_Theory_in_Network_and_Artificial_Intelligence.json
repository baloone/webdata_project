{"id":"350128321_A_Review_on_Graph_Theory_in_Network_and_Artificial_Intelligence","abstract":"The Mathematics field assumes crucial function in different fields. One of the significant territories in Mathematics is Graph theory which isutilized in basic models. We give a study of Graph theory utilized in computer sciences. The study comprises of a portrayal of specific themes from the Graph theory of the zone of Computer science where they are utilized. In any case, for each portrayed hypothesis we show the fields where it is utilized. For example in demonstrating and looking through Internet, in Computer science vision, design acknowledgment, information mining, multiprocessor frameworks, factual information bases, and in a few different regions. This paper gives a overview of the application of Graph theory in heterogeneous fields somewhat however chiefly centers around the software engineering applications that utilizations Graph theory ideas. Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence applications and an overview has been presented in this article.","authors":["Geetha Narayanan Kannaiyan","Bridjesh Pappula","Ragavi Veerubommu"],"meta":["March 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1831(1):012002","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1831/1/012002"],"references":["322322694_MEA_and_DEE_as_additives_on_diesel_engine_using_waste_plastic_oil_diesel_blends","3193287_Introduction_to_the_special_section_on_graph_algorithms_in_computer_vision","3049712_Constructing_a_Message-Pruning_Tree_with_Minimum_Cost_for_Tracking_Moving_Objects_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Is_NP-Complete_and_an_Enhanced_Data_Aggregation_Structure","318947425_Effects_of_diethyl_ether_on_performance_and_emission_characteristics_of_a_diesel_engine_using_toroidal_profile_bowl_piston_by_varying_injection_pressure","309168354_Assessment_of_Optimal_Combination_of_Operating_Parameters_using_Graph_Theory_Matrix_Approach","229650050_Some_applications_of_graph_contractions"]}
