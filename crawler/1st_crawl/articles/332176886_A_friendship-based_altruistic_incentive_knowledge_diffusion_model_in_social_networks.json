{"id":"332176886_A_friendship-based_altruistic_incentive_knowledge_diffusion_model_in_social_networks","abstract":"Knowledge diffusion is the main driving force behind technology innovation, economic development and social progress. Based on the fact that the people prefer to spread knowledge to their acquaintances, a friendship-based altruistic incentive knowledge diffusion model (SIH model) is proposed in this paper. In the model, we design an altruistic incentive mechanisms whereby an individual can benefit from his friends as the knowledge level increases. We derive mean-field equations to describe the dynamics of knowledge transmission in friendship networks. The theoretical analysis identifies a criterion for the persistence of the infected and the susceptible individuals. The simulations include two aspects: the density of individuals, and the performance of knowledge diffusion. The density results show that the cost rates between the infected and hesitant individuals have a significant effect on the rate of knowledge transmission. Additionally, the diffusion performance of regular networks is greater than small-world networks and scale-free networks in our diffusion mechanism. Furthermore, experiments are performed among three classes in two courses, and the average scores and standard deviations are compared. The results verify the positive effect of our approach.","authors":["Wei Zheng","Hao Pan","Sun Chen"],"meta":["April 2019Information Sciences 491(272)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2019.04.009"],"references":["314433386_Knowledge_Acquisition_A_Complex_Networks_Approach","282594524_Mining_Community_and_Inferring_Friendship_in_Mobile_Social_Networks","274040477_Absorptive_capacity_A_non-linear_process","272370982_Improved_knowledge_diffusion_model_based_on_the_collaboration_hypernetwork","262813340_Experimental_Evidence_of_Massive-Scale_Emotional_Contagion_Through_Social_Networks","255662194_Nurturing_Interpersonal_Trust_in_Knowledge-Sharing_Networks","248384804_Contagion_of_Cooperation_in_Static_and_Fluid_Social_Networks","221802130_The_Global_Knowledge_Society","221520131_Exploring_social_influence_via_posterior_effect_of_word-of-mouth_recommendations","200465320_Knowledge_and_the_Speed_of_the_Transfer_and_Imitation_of_Organizational_Capabilities_An_Empirical_Test","12712628_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_Experiments_Examining_the_Effect_of_Extrinsic_Rewards_on_Intrinsic_Motivation","5915389_Roles_of_mixing_patterns_in_cooperation_on_a_scale-free_networked_game","2176108_A_Unified_Framework_for_the_Pareto_Law_and_Matthew_Effect_using_Scale-Free_Networks","328110328_Explore_the_Ubiquitous_Learning_on_Campus_A_Friendship-Based_Knowledge_Diffusion_Approach","327450959_Persistence_and_extinction_for_an_age-structured_stochastic_SVIR_epidemic_model_with_generalized_nonlinear_incidence_rate","324689002_SPIR_The_potential_spreaders_involved_SIR_model_for_information_diffusion_in_social_networks","324637713_The_impact_of_group_propagation_on_rumor_spreading_in_mobile_social_networks","323233466_Rumor_diffusion_model_with_spatio-temporal_diffusion_and_uncertainty_of_behavior_decision_in_complex_social_networks","319642450_Revealing_Community_Structures_by_Ensemble_Clustering_using_Group_Diffusion","316355077_Analyzing_concept_complexity_knowledge_ageing_and_diffusion_pattern_of_Mooc","310812041_SISL_and_SIRL_Two_knowledge_dissemination_models_with_leader_nodes_on_cooperative_learning_networks","291888021_Knowledge_Flows_within_Multinational_Corporations","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","283378854_Absorptive_Capacity_A_New_Perspective_on_Learning_and_Innovation","278729450_Rumor_spreading_model_considering_hesitating_mechanism_in_complex_social_networks","273352201_The_independent_spreaders_involved_SIR_Rumor_model_in_complex_networks","271805974_Incentive_Systems_A_Theory_of_Organizations","267641177_Knowledge_diffusion_in_the_collaboration_hypernetwork","264708826_Epidemic_processes_in_complex_networks","262156992_Ranking_User_Influence_in_Healthcare_Social_Media","257217973_Scale-free_network_provides_an_optimal_pattern_for_knowledge_transfer","243770640_Bureaucracy_What_Government_Agencies_Do_and_Why_They_Do_It","239666478_Rewards_and_Punishments_as_Selective_Incentives_for_Collective_Action","232490033_The_Psychology_of_Social_Impact","230221888_Connected_The_Surprising_Power_of_Our_Social_Networks_and_How_They_Shape_Our_Lives","223266426_Structural_effects_of_RD_collaboration_network_on_knowledge_diffusion_performance","222529122_Knowledge_dynamics_in_a_network_industry","222299779_Network_Structure_and_the_Diffusion_of_Knowledge","221781424_Social_Networks_and_Cooperation_in_Hunter-Gatherers","220312999_Distributed_recommender_for_peer-to-peer_knowledge_sharing","220219580_Estimating_the_effect_of_organizational_structure_on_knowledge_transfer_A_neural_network_approach","23691466_The_Economics_of_Growth","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks","2379126_Mining_the_Network_Value_of_Customers"]}
