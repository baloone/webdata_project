{"id":"250888490_Developing_a_Hypermedia_System_for_Computer_Systems_Education","abstract":"Hypermedia systems are combinations of multimedia systems and hypertext. They have a great potential in education and, in particular, in computer science education. This article describes a method to develop a hypermedia system for computer systems education. Such a system will be used in teaching an introductory course in computer systems. It provides an ideal interactive environment for learning, teaching, designing, and implementing studentsâ€™ projects in computer organization and related topics. The article also reports on the progress of developing a prototype system for the computer science program at the American University of Beirut.","authors":["Ahmad H.
