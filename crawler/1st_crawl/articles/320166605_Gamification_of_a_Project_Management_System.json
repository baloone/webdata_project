{"id":"320166605_Gamification_of_a_Project_Management_System","abstract":"Gamification is the use of elements of game design and mechanics in serious contexts for enhancing the value of a service or a product for its users. We describe psychological foundations and social motives for gamification, its principles and concepts, game rules (mechanics) and elements of game as well as techniques and patterns of gamification. As a case study, we analyze gamification of a Trogon Project Management System. For evaluation of gamified interface, we propose to use WCAG 2.0 rules, adapted for evaluating color contrast of game layer interfaces, and System Usability Scale (SUS) to evaluate usability of gamification.","authors":["Darius A≈°eri≈°kis","Robertas Damasevicius"],"meta":["July 2014","Conference: ACHI 2014 : The Seventh International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human InteractionsAt: Barcelona","Projects: Multidisciplinary Researchüéì‚úåÔ∏èGames and Serious Games"],"references":["319394819_SUS_--_a_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","261502701_A_Generic_Platform_for_Enterprise_Gamification","260422760_Using_Gamification_in_an_Online_Community","244486331_Gamification_Designing_for_motivation","230854734_Leveraging_gamification_in_demand_dispatch_systems","230854710_From_Game_Design_Elements_to_Gamefulness_Defining_Gamification","271461888_GaML_-_A_Modeling_Language_for_Gamification","261451450_Gamifying_authentication","261349474_A_Method_to_Engage_Employees_Using_Gamification_in_BPO_Industry","254852381_Engineering_emergence_applied_theory_for_game_design"]}
