{"id":"220896205_Abstract_DPLL_and_Abstract_DPLL_Modulo_Theories","abstract":"We introduce Abstract DPLL, a general and simple abstract rule-based formulation of the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) procedure. Its properties,\nsuch as soundness, completeness or termination, immediately carry over to the modern DPLL implementations with features such\nas non-chronological backtracking or clause learning. This allows one to formally reason about practical DPLL algorithms in\na simple way. In the second part of this paper we extend the framework to Abstract DPLL modulo theories. This allows us to express—and formally reason about—state-of-the-art concrete DPLL-based techniques for satisfiability modulo\nbackground theories, such as the different lazy approaches, or our DPLL(T) framework.","authors":["Robert Nieuwenhuis","Albert Oliveras","Cesare Tinelli"],"meta":["January 2004","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-32275-7_3","SourceDBLP","Conference: Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Reasoning, 11th International Conference, LPAR 2004, Montevideo, Uruguay, March 14-18, 2005, Proceedings"],"references":["226030648_SATO_An_efficient_prepositional_prover","221403223_Theorem_Proving_Using_Lazy_Proof_Explication","221403128_Checking_Satisfiability_of_First-Order_Formulas_by_Incremental_Translation_to_SAT","47861492_DPLLT_Fast_Decision_Procedures","2497121_Lemmas_on_Demand_for_Satisfiability_Solvers","2492575_SAT-Based_Procedures_for_Temporal_Reasoning","2489750_A_SAT_Based_Approach_for_Solving_Formulas_over_Boolean_and_Linear_Mathematical_Propositions","244954154_A_Computing_Procedure_for_Quantification_Theory","243774686_CVC_Lite_A_New_Implementation_of_the_Cooperating_Validity_Checker","225737292_A_SAT_Based_Approach_for_Solving_Formulas_over_Boolean_and_Linear_Mathematical_Propositions","220431995_Putnam_H_A_Computing_Procedure_for_Quantification_Theory_Journal_of_the_ACM_7_201-215","213887971_A_Machine_Program_for_Theorem_Proving","3945556_BerkMin_A_fast_and_robust_SAT-solver","3904486_Chaff_Engineering_an_efficient_SAT_solver","3044093_GRASP_A_Search_Algorithm_for_Propositional_Satisfiability","2571884_A_DPLL-based_Calculus_for_Ground_Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories","2409503_Chaff_Engineering_an_Efficient_SAT_Solver"]}
