{"id":"242789382_Hamiltonian_circuits_in_some_maps_on_the_torus","abstract":"A map on the torus is called regular of type {p, q}, if each vertex is of valence q and each face has p edges. It is proved that in the graph consisting of the vertices and edges of a regular map on the torus of type {3, 6} or {4, 4} there exists a Hamiltonian circuit. For maps of type {6, 3} the same problem is only partially solved. A Hamiltonian circuit is also shown to exist in every 6-connected graph on the torus.","authors":["Amos Altshuler"],"meta":["February 1972Discrete Mathematics 1(4):299-314","DOI:10.1016/0012-365X(72)90037-4"],"references":["287183736_Regular_maps_on_an_anchor_ring","287183453_On_the_regular_polyhedra_of_analysis_situs","268918441_Sur_les_polyedres_reguliers_de_l'Analysis_Situs","266210952_Geometric_Embedding_of_Complexes","266009698_Gruppenbilder","265364231_Generators_and_Relations_for_Discrete_Groups","242789440_On_the_genus_and_connectivity_of_Hamiltonian_graphs","242609276_Minimal_imbeddings_and_the_genus_of_a_graph","238692545_A_theorem_on_graph","229221813_Polyhedral_realization_in_R3_of_triangulations_of_the_torus_and_2-manifolds_in_cyclic_4-polytopes","225968802_Das_Geschlecht_des_volstandiger_paaren_Graphen"]}
