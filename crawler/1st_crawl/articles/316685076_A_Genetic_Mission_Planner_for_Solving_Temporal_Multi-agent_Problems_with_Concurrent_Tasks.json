{"id":"316685076_A_Genetic_Mission_Planner_for_Solving_Temporal_Multi-agent_Problems_with_Concurrent_Tasks","abstract":"In this paper, a centralized mission planner is presented. The planner employs a genetic algorithm for the optimization of the temporal planning problem. With the knowledge of agents’ specification and capabilities, as well as constraints and parameters for each task, the planner can produce plans that utilize multi-agent tasks, concurrency on agent level, and heterogeneous agents. Numerous optimization criteria that can be of use to the mission operator are tested on the same mission data set. Promising results and effectiveness of this approach are presented in the case study section","authors":["Branko Miloradovic","Baran Çürüklü","Mikael Ekström"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-61833-3_51","Conference: International Conference on Swarm IntelligenceAt: Fukuoka, Japan","Project: SWARMs"],"references":["313373357_The_Multiagent_Planning_Problem","308994035_A_genetic_planner_for_mission_planning_of_cooperative_agents_in_an_underwater_environment","308877714_Solving_complex_multi-UAV_mission_planning_problems_using_multi-objective_genetic_algorithms","268043232_Comparison_of_eight_evolutionary_crossover_operators_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem","234804469_Project_scheduling_using_a_competitive_genetic_algorithm","221995234_Controlling_The_False_Discovery_Rate_-_A_Practical_And_Powerful_Approach_To_Multiple_Testing","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","285042838_Special_Issue_on_Second_International_Conference_on_the_Theory_and_Practice_of_Natural_Computing_TPNC_2013","242356870_Adaptation_In_Natural_And_Artificial_Systems","238506082_Cooperative_Planning_Architectures_for_Multi-Vehicle_Autonomous_Operations"]}
