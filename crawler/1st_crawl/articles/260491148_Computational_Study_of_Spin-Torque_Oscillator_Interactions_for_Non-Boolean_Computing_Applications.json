{"id":"260491148_Computational_Study_of_Spin-Torque_Oscillator_Interactions_for_Non-Boolean_Computing_Applications","abstract":"We present a bottom-up approach for building non-Boolean signal processing devices from coupled spin-torque oscillators (STOs). We use micromagnetic simulations to study frequency-locking properties of electrically connected out-of plane magnetized STOs. After developing and verifying compact models for interacting STOs, we show that the frequency locking of STOs exhibits associative properties. Coupled STO networks therefore may be used as building blocks of non-Boolean pattern matching circuitry.","authors":["Gyorgy Csaba","Wolfgang Porod"],"meta":["July 2013IEEE Transactions on Magnetics 49(7):4447-4451","DOI:10.1109/TMAG.2013.2244202"],"references":["255565638_Non-Boolean_Associative_Architectures_Based_on_Nano-Oscillators","49777350_Spin-wave_interference_patterns_created_by_spin-torque_nano-oscillators_for_memory_and_computation","45885678_Spin_Transfer_Dynamics_in_Spin_Valves_with_Out-of-plane_Magnetized_CoNi_Free_Layers","16246447_Neural_Networks_and_Physical_Systems_with_Emergent_Collective_Computational_Abilities","7600289_Mutual_phase-locking_of_microwave_spin_torque_nano-oscillators","4257491_Mutual_Phase-Locking_of_Microwave_Spin_Torque_Nano-Oscillators","1875584_Frequency_Modulation_of_Spin-Transfer_Oscillators","328870825_Spin-transfer_nano-oscillators","292215395_Neural_networks_and_physical_systems_with_emergent_collective_computational_abilities","271367784_OOMMF_user's_guide_Version_10","261413306_Modeling_of_coupled_spin_torque_oscillators_for_applications_in_associative_memories","261086857_Spin_torque_oscillator_models_for_applications_in_associative_memories","261086850_CMOS_supporting_circuitries_for_nano-oscillator-based_associative_memories","259977263_OOMMF_User's_Guide_Version_10","240161910_Oscillatory_Neurocomputers_with_Dynamic_Connectivity","231073548_Pattern_recognition_with_simple_oscillating_circuits","225183881_High-Power_Coherent_Microwave_Emission_from_Magnetic_Tunnel_Junction_Nano-oscillators_with_Perpendicular_Anisotropy","224488703_Demagnetizing_Factors_for_Rectangular_Ferromagnetic_Prisms","224460311_Capacitance_Enhanced_Synchronization_of_Pairs_of_Spin-Transfer_Oscillators","224096655_Phase-locking_and_frustration_in_an_array_of_nonlinear_spin-torque_nano-oscillators","222467703_Slonczewski_J_C_Current-driven_excitations_of_magnetic_multilayers_J_Magn_Magn_Mater_159_L1-L7","222019339_Currents_and_torques_in_metallic_magnetic_multilayers","26723957_Microwave_sources_Spin-torque_oscillators_get_in_phase"]}
