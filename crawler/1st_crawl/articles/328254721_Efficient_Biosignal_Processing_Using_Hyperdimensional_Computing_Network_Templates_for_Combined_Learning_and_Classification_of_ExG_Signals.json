{"id":"328254721_Efficient_Biosignal_Processing_Using_Hyperdimensional_Computing_Network_Templates_for_Combined_Learning_and_Classification_of_ExG_Signals","abstract":"Recognizing the very size of the brainâ€™s circuits, hyperdimensional (HD) computing can model neural activity patterns with points in a HD space, that is, with HD vectors. Key examined properties of HD computing include: a versatile set of arithmetic operations on HD vectors, generality, scalability, analyzability, one-shot learning, and energy efficiency. These make it a prime candidate for efficient biosignal processing where signals are noisy and nonstationary, training data sets are not huge, individual variability is significant, and energy-efficiency constraints are tight. Purely based on native HD computing operators, we describe a combined method for multiclass learning and classification of various ExG biosignals such as electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG). We develop a full set of HD network templates that comprehensively encode body potentials and brain neural activity recorded from different electrodes into a single HD vector without requiring domain expert knowledge or\nad hoc \nelectrode selection process. Such encoded HD vector is processed as a single unit for fast one-shot learning, and robust classification. It can be interpreted to identify the most useful features as well. Compared to state-of-the-art counterparts, HD computing enables online, incremental, and fast learning as it demands less than a third as much training data as well as less preprocessing.","authors":["Abbas Rahimi","Pentti Kanerva","Luca Benini","J.M.
