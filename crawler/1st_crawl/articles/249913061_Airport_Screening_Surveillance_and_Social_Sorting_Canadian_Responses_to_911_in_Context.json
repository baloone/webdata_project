{"id":"249913061_Airport_Screening_Surveillance_and_Social_Sorting_Canadian_Responses_to_911_in_Context","abstract":"Since 9/11, aviation security has become a major preoccupation of Western governments, not least Canada's. Some unprecedented security measures have been taken, and all air travelers are aware both of how these now affect their need for certain documents and of the extra time required for air travel. When placed in a broader frame, however, these developments may be seen as rational expansions of existing measures increasingly common to what might be seen as the symbiotically growing \"surveillance society\" and \"safety state.\" Here, surveillance has become a feature not of specific monitoring of suspects but of generalized social sorting of populations, in this case in relation to their perceived levels of dangerousness. And safety is the new criterion of good policy within risk-management regimes. The result, in Canadian airports, is a new emphasis on Advanced Passenger Information (API) and the Passenger Name Record (PNR) as the means of tracking travellers and the development of a coordinated plan under the new Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) for the screening of passengers and baggage. The demands of global free trade mean that mobility of goods and persons is a high priority, but this is constrained by the need to demonstrate that airport conditions are safe and that certain classes of person do not cross the (internal) border easily.","authors":["David Lyon"],"meta":["June 2006Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice/La Revue canadienne de criminologie et de justice p√©nale 48(3):397-411","DOI:10.1353/ccj.2006.0030"],"references":["263062192_All_That_Glitters_is_Not_Gold_Digging_Beneath_the_Surface_of_Data_Mining","249912955_Neither_Safe_Nor_Sound_The_Perils_and_Possibilities_of_Risk","248543811_North_American_Cooperation_in_an_Era_of_Homeland_Security"]}
