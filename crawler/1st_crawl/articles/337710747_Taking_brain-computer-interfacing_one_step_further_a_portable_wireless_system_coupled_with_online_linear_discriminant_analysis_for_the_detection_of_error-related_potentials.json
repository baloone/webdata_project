Among them, the concept of Brain-Computer-Interfaces, facilitating direct communication between brain and computer, has inspired numerous practical ideas on controlling an external device via neural signals. The perception of an error made by oneself, another human or a machine, triggers an error-related potential, which has already been exploited as a binary correction readout for decisions made by Brain-ComputerInterfaces. Our approach takes advantage of this technique, while taking it one step further regarding portability by using an affordable, robust and wireless headset, the Emotiv EPOC ⁺ , to recognize error-related potentials in electroencephalograms of subjects performing various on-site, dynamic tasks. We also introduce a straightforward linear-discriminant analysis classifier that extends the range of detection from offline, post-hoc analysis, to online, within-trial recordings, an essential condition towards blending machine-performed tasks with human-generated thought processes in everyday life.","authors":["Dorina Ancău","Nicolae-Marius Roman","Ancau Mihai"],"meta":["January 2019MATEC Web of Conferences 299:02004","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/201929902004"],"references":["316994943_Linear_discriminant_analysis_A_detailed_tutorial","311739432_A_neuro-based_method_for_detecting_context-dependent_erroneous_robot_action","264205241_Errare_machinale_est_The_use_of_error-related_potentials_in_brain-machine_interfaces","227176331_Practical_Designs_of_Brain-Computer_Interfaces_Based_on_the_Modulation_of_EEG_Rhythms","8141620_Control_of_a_two-dimensional_movement_signal_by_a_noninvasive_brain-computer_interface_in_humans","285773466_Control_of_a_two-dimensional_movement_signal_by_a_noninvasive_brain-computer_interface_in_humans","259560244_Neurophysiology_of_Performance_Monitoring_and_Adaptive_Behavior","200003627_An_Introduction_to_The_Event-Related_Potential_Technique","7947708_On_the_ERN_and_the_significance_of_errors","7657191_Error-Related_Negativity_Predicts_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Conflict_Biases","6562215_Theta_phase_resetting_and_the_error-related_negativity"]}
