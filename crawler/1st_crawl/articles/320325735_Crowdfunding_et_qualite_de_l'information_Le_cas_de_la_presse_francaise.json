{"id":"320325735_Crowdfunding_et_qualite_de_l'information_Le_cas_de_la_presse_francaise","abstract":"Crowdfunding and information quality\n\nThe case of the French press\nCrowdfunding differs from other types of online funding because of the role of the communities that form around projects. Very few studies have examined the impact of these participative dynamics on the quality of the final projects that emerge from the campaigns. To fill this gap, this paper draws on a study of 40 online media and 1,200 articles published by these media, funded through the two main crowdfunding platforms in France: KissKissBanBank and Ulule. It shows that journalistic crowdfunding campaigns can have a mixed impact on the projects produced: a negative impact on the diversity of the information, and a positive impact on its richness, depth and readability.","authors":["Christophe Cariou","Inna Lyubareva","Fabrice Rochelandet"],"meta":["October 2017RÃ©seaux 205(5):23","DOI:10.3917/res.205.0023"],"references":["272543487_Some_Simple_Economics_of_Crowdfunding","272121749_Motivations_Behind_Donors'_Contributions_to_Crowdfunded_Journalism","249689491_A_Study_of_Content_Diversity_in_Online_Citizen_Journalism_and_Online_Newspaper_Articles","5149740_How_Should_Cultural_Diversity_Be_Measured_An_Application_Using_the_French_Publishing_Industry","331950463_Evolution_of_the_business_models_in_creative_industries_A_study_of_the_French_online_press","329653050_Democratizing_Innovation","276305040_Crowdfunding_independent_and_freelance_journalism_Negotiating_journalistic_norms_of_autonomy_and_objectivity","250375631_La_lisibilite_redactionnelle_fondements_et_perspectives","236015541_Meaning-generating_propositions_of_reality_by_media_Quality_attributes_and_functions_of_journalism","228150567_Word-of-Mouth_for_Movies_Its_Dynamics_and_Impact_on_Box_Office_Revenue","227739532_The_Value_of_Crowdsourcing_Can_Users_Really_Compete_with_Professionals_in_Generating_New_Product_Ideas","1955545_Coase's_Penguin_Or_Linux_and_The_Nature_of_the_Firm","1761888_A_correlated_topic_model_of_Science"]}
