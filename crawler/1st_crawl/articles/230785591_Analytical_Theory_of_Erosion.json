{"id":"230785591_Analytical_Theory_of_Erosion","abstract":"A mathematical theory of erosion is developed along similar lines to the classical Fourier theory of heat flow in solids. The general theory is considered in some detail, and a few representative examples of its application to stream profiles and valley slopes are suggested in outline.","authors":["W. E. H.
