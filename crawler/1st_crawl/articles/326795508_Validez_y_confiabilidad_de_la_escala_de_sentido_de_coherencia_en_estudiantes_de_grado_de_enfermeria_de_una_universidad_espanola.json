Andalusia, Spain.\n\nParticipants: \n384 students from the first three years of the nursing degree in the University of Jaén.\n\nMain measurement: \nInternal consistency was studied by Cronbach's alpha, reliability test-retest was measured by intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) and construct validity was analysed by exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and known-groups technique.\n\nResults: \nThe internal consistency of the scale was adequate (Cronbach α = 0.809). The ICC for the reliability test-retest was 0.91. The exploratory factor analysis showed 3 factors explaining 50.13% of the variance. The confirmatory factor analysis showed f goodness-of-fit indexes for the proposed model CFI=0.965; RMSA=0.041; GFI=0.963; SRMR=0.041. Statistically significant differences in sense of coherence were found among the subgroups of students with healthy and unhealthy lifestyles (p <0.001).\n\nConclusions: \nThe study confirms the multidimensionality of the OLQ-13 scale, in which 3 factors were identified: external meaningful, comprehensibility and manageability, and internal comprehensibility and manageability. The OLQ-13 may be a valid and reliable scale for use in the Spanish university population.","authors":["María del Carmen Vega Martínez","Antonio Frías Osuna","Rafael Del-Pino-Casado"],"meta":["August 2018Gaceta Sanitaria 33(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.gaceta.2018.02.009"],"references":["301956124_Aspectos_conceptuales_e_historicos_del_sentido_de_coherencia_propuesto_por_Antonovsky_una_alternativa_para_abordar_el_tema_de_la_salud_mental","301334360_Sense_of_coherence_and_associated_factors_among_university_students_in_China_Cross-sectional_evidence","315815228_Factors_promoting_sense_of_coherence_among_university_students_in_urban_areas_of_Japan_individual-level_social_capital_self-efficacy_and_mental_health","312630391_Structural_equation_modeling_Guidelines_for_determining_model_fit","307881851_Validacion_del_Cuestionario_de_Orientacion_a_la_Vida_OLQ-13_de_Antonovsky_en_una_muestra_de_estudiantes_universitarios_en_Navarra","307872128_Determinants_of_health-related_lifestyles_among_university_students","299777294_La_investigacion_en_ciencias_sociales_estrategias_de_investigacion","295084580_The_utility_of_salutogenesis_for_guiding_health_promotion_the_case_for_young_people's_well-being","289707096_Sense_of_coherence_as_a_mediator_between_hostility_and_health-related_quality_of_life_among_coronary_heart_disease_patients","284977208_Unraveling_The_Mystery_of_Health_-_How_People_Manage_Stress_and_Stay_Well"]}
