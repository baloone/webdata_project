{"id":"225269719_A_Parameterized_View_on_Matroid_Optimization_Problems","abstract":"Matroid theory gives us powerful techniques for understanding combinatorial optimization problems and for designing polynomial-time algorithms. However, several natural matroid problems, such as 3-matroid intersection, are NP-hard. Here we investigate these problems from the parameterized complexity point of view: instead of the trivial O(n\nk\n) time brute force algorithm for finding a k-element solution, we try to give algorithms with uniformly polynomial (i.e., f(k)\nn\nO(1)) running time. The main result is that if the ground set of a represented matroid is partitioned into blocks of size ℓ, then we can determine in f(k,ℓ)\nn\nO(1) randomized time whether there is an independent set that is the union of k blocks. As consequence, algorithms with similar running time are obtained for other problems such as finding a k-set in the intersection of ℓ matroids, or finding k terminals in a network such that each of them can be connected simultaneously to the source by ℓ disjoint paths.","authors":["Dániel Marx"],"meta":["June 2006","DOI:10.1007/11786986_57","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Automata, Languages and Programming - Volume Part I"],"references":["246201488_Flats_in_matroids_and_geometric_graphs","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","269001981_Parametrized_complexity_theory","257283220_Algebra","243006877_Applications_of_Menger's_Graph_Theorem","239062942_Fellows_Parameterized_Complexity_Springer-Verlag","234812500_Fast_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Verification_of_Polynomial_Identities","230596104_How_to_Find_Long_Paths_Efficiently","228394568_Parameterized_coloring_problems_on_chordal_graphs","225621879_Finding_and_Counting_Given_Length_Cycles","222569763_Machine-based_methods_in_parameterized_complexity_theory","222419640_Parameterized_Coloring_Problems_on_Chordal_Graphs","221149827_Probabilistic_algorithms_for_sparse_polynomials","220752628_Finding_Minimally_Weighted_Subgraphs","220075366_Matroid_matching_and_some_applications","37069817_Matroid_Theory_and_its_Applications_in_Electric_Network_Theory_and_in_Statics","2427002_Fast_Construction_of_Irreducible_Polynomials_over_Finite_Fields"]}
