{"id":"3044093_GRASP_A_Search_Algorithm_for_Propositional_Satisfiability","abstract":"This paper introduces GRASP (Generic seaRch Algorithm for the\nSatisfiability Problem), a new search algorithm for Propositional\nSatisfiability (SAT). GRASP incorporates several search-pruning\ntechniques that proved to be quite powerful on a wide variety of SAT\nproblems. Some of these techniques are specific to SAT, whereas others\nare similar in spirit to approaches in other fields of Artificial\nIntelligence. GRASP is premised on the inevitability of conflicts during\nthe search and its most distinguishing feature is the augmentation of\nbasic backtracking search with a powerful conflict analysis procedure.\nAnalyzing conflicts to determine their causes enables GRASP to backtrack\nnonchronologically to earlier levels in the search tree, potentially\npruning large portions of the search space. In addition, by\n“recording” the causes of conflicts, GRASP can recognize and\npreempt the occurrence of similar conflicts later on in the search.\nFinally, straightforward bookkeeping of the causality chains leading up\nto conflicts allows GRASP to identify assignments that are necessary for\na solution to be found. Experimental results obtained from a large\nnumber of benchmarks indicate that application of the proposed conflict\nanalysis techniques to SAT algorithms can be extremely effective for a\nlarge number of representative classes of SAT instances","authors":["João P.
