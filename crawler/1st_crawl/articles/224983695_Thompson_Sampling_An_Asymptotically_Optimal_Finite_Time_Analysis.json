{"id":"224983695_Thompson_Sampling_An_Asymptotically_Optimal_Finite_Time_Analysis","abstract":"The question of the optimality of Thompson Sampling for solving the\nstochastic multi-armed bandit problem had been open since 1933. In this paper\nwe answer it positively for the case of Bernoulli rewards by providing the\nfirst finite-time analysis that matches the asymptotic rate given in the Lai\nand Robbins lower bound for the cumulative regret. The proof is accompanied by\na numerical comparison with other optimal policies, experiments that have been\nlacking in the literature until now for the Bernoulli case.","authors":["Emilie Kaufmann","Nathaniel Korda","Remi Munos"],"meta":["May 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-34106-9_18","SourcearXiv","Conference: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory"],"references":["288933771_Solving_two-armed_Bernoulli_bandit_problems_using_a_Bayesian_learning_automaton","220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","220151284_Exploration-exploitation_tradeoff_using_variance_estimates_in_multi-armed_bandits","216300705_A_Bayesian_Learning_Automaton_for_Solving_Two-Armed_Bernoulli_Bandit_Problems","51967820_Analysis_of_Thompson_Sampling_for_the_multi-armed_bandit_problem","50311185_A_Finite-Time_Analysis_of_Multi-armed_Bandits_Problems_with_Kullback-Leibler_Divergences","266529330_An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Thompson_Sampling","265490932_On_Bayesian_Upper_Confidence_Bounds_for_Bandit_Problems","262274887_Optimistic_Bayesian_Sampling_in_Contextual-Bandit_Problems","239292007_Asymptotically_efficient_adaptive_allocation_rules1","221497653_An_Asymptotically_Optimal_Bandit_Algorithm_for_Bounded_Support_Models","221394148_Deviations_of_Stochastic_Bandit_Regret","220320997_Regret_Bounds_and_Minimax_Policies_under_Partial_Monitoring","201976635_On_the_Likelihood_That_One_Unknown_Probability_Exceeds_Another_in_View_of_the_Evidence_of_Two_Samples","48207451_The_KL-UCB_Algorithm_for_Bounded_Stochastic_Bandits_and_Beyond"]}
