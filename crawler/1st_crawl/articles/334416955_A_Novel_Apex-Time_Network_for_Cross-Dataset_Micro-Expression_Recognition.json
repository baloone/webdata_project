{"id":"334416955_A_Novel_Apex-Time_Network_for_Cross-Dataset_Micro-Expression_Recognition","abstract":"The automatic recognition of micro-expression has been boosted ever since the successful introduction of deep learning approaches. As researchers working on such topics are moving to learn from the nature of micro-expression, the practice of using deep learning techniques has evolved from processing the entire video clip of micro-expression to the recognition on apex frame. Using the apex frame is able to get rid of redundant video frames, but the relevant temporal evidence of micro-expression would be thereby left out. This paper proposes a novel Apex-Time Network (ATNet) to recognize micro-expression based on spatial information from the apex frame as well as on temporal information from the respective-adjacent frames. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we demonstrate the improvement achieved by learning such temporal information. Specially, the model with such temporal information is more robust in cross-dataset validations.","authors":["Min Peng","Chongyang Wang","Tao Bi","T.
