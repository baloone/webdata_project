{"id":"335784640_An_Approach_of_Training_Virtual_Environment_for_Teaching_Electro-Pneumatic_Systems","abstract":"It is clear that in recent years have emerged countless simulators in all possible work areas for reaching the goals of Industry 4.0. Unity Pro software focuses on studying the options and possibilities offered virtual environments for teaching in schools and universities. The aim of this paper is intended to create a practical training environment for the simulation and control of a pneumatic process for the students of Industrial Process Engineering of Automation. This virtual environment uses MQTT protocol into a Raspberry Pi to transmit an instruction for control a real FESTO pneumatic lab based on what students develop during their virtual classes, granting and facilitating the student and teacher a new method that accelerates the learning process.","authors":["Carlos A.
