{"id":"317344114_NMTPY_A_Flexible_Toolkit_for_Advanced_Neural_Machine_Translation_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, we present nmtpy, a flexible Python toolkit based on Theano for training Neural Machine Translation and other neural sequence-to-sequence architectures. nmtpy decouples the specification of a network from the training and inference utilities to simplify the addition of a new architecture and reduce the amount of boilerplate code to be written. nmtpy has been used for LIUM's top-ranked submissions to WMT Multimodal Machine Translation and News Translation tasks in 2016 and 2017.","authors":["Ozan Çağlayan","Mercedes Garcia Martinez","Adrien Bardet","Walid Aransa"],"meta":["June 2017Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics 109(1)","DOI:10.1515/pralin-2017-0035","Project: Neural Machine Translation"],"references":["318741834_Nematus_a_Toolkit_for_Neural_Machine_Translation","318460948_LIUM_Machine_Translation_Systems_for_WMT17_News_Translation_Task","318460699_LIUM-CVC_Submissions_for_WMT17_Multimodal_Translation_Task","316245888_Neural_Monkey_An_Open-source_Tool_for_Sequence_Learning","322590009_Findings_of_the_Second_Shared_Task_on_Multimodal_Machine_Translation_and_Multilingual_Image_Description","320517051_Findings_of_the_Second_Shared_Task_on_Multimodal_Machine_Translation_and_Multilingual_Image_Description","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","319770257_Exact_solutions_to_the_nonlinear_dynamics_of_learning_in_deep_linear_neural_networks","319770252_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","319662760_OpenNMT_Open-source_Toolkit_for_Neural_Machine_Translation"]}
