{"id":"266135774_Discretization_vertex_orders_in_distance_geometry","abstract":"When a weighted graph is an instance of the Distance Geometry Problem (DGP), certain types of vertex orders (called discretization orders) allow the use of a very efficient, precise and robust discrete search algorithm (called Branch-and-Prune). Accordingly, finding such orders is critically important in order to solve DGPs in practice. We discuss three types of discretization orders, the complexity of determining their existence in a given graph, and the inclusion relations between the three order existence problems. We also give three mathematical programming formulations of some of these ordering problems.","authors":["Andrea Cassioli","Oktay Gunluk","Carlile Lavor","Leo Liberti"],"meta":["September 2014Discrete Applied Mathematics","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2014.08.035"],"references":["249991685_Counting_the_number_of_solutions_of_K_DMDGP_instances","229325056_Exploiting_Symmetry_Properties_of_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","226921079_The_interval_Branch_Prune_Algorithm_for_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem_with_Inexact_Distances","225202160_Discretization_Orders_for_Distance_Geometry_Problems","225162852_The_Discretizable_Distance_Geometry_Problem","224904730_Euclidean_Distance_Geometry_and_Applications","221245986_Rigidity_Computation_and_Randomization_in_Network_Localization","267434324_The_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem_seems_Easier_on_Proteins","265329498_On_the_Identification_of_Discretization_Orders_for_Distance_Geometry_with_Intervals","260030948_On_the_Number_of_Realizations_of_Certain_Henneberg_Graphs_arising_in_Protein_Conformation","228568491_1_The_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","228340096_Molecular_distance_geometry_methods_From_continuous_to_discrete","227658216_A_Branch-and-Prune_algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","225857936_A_Geometric_Build-Up_Algorithm_for_Solving_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem_with_Sparse_Distance_Data","220403465_Combining_variable_neighborhood_search_and_estimation_of_distribution_algorithms_in_the_protein_side_chain_placement_problem","16882221_Pseudo-structures_for_the_20_Common_Amino_Acids_for_Use_in_Studies_of_Protein_Conformations_by_Measurements_of_Intramolecular_Proton-Proton_Distance_Constraints_with_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance"]}
