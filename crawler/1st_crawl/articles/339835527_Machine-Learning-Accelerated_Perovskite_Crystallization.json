{"id":"339835527_Machine-Learning-Accelerated_Perovskite_Crystallization","abstract":"Perovskites have seen significant research interest in the last decade. As ternary and quaternary compounds, their chemical space is exceptionally large, yet perovskite development has been limited to a restricted set of chemical constituents often discovered through trial and error. Here, we report a high-throughput experimental framework for the discovery of new perovskite single crystals. We use machine learning (ML) to guide the sequence of ever-improved robotic synthetic trials. We perform high-throughput syntheses of perovskite single crystals with a protein crystallization robot and characterize the outcomes with the aid of convolutional neural network-based image recognition. We then use an ML model to predict the optimal conditions for the synthesis of a new perovskite single crystal, enabling us to report the first synthesis of (3-PLA)2PbCl4.This material exhibits strong blue emission, illustrating the applicability of the method in identifying new optoelectronic materials.","authors":["Jeffrey Kirman","Andrew Johnston","Douglas A.
