{"id":"312278884_Adaptive_Optimal_PMU_Placement_Based_on_Empirical_Observability_Gramian","abstract":"In this paper we compare four measures of the empirical observability Gramian\nthat are used to quantify the observability of system states and to obtain the\noptimal PMU placement for power system dynamic state estimation. An adaptive\nPMU placement method is also proposed by making use of the advantages of these\nmeasures. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by performing\ndynamic state estimation on NPCC 48-machine system.","authors":["Junjian Qi","Kai Sun","Wei Kang"],"meta":["August 2016IFAC-PapersOnLine 49(18):482-487","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.10.211","Conference: IFAC Symposium on Non-Linear Control Systems (NOLCOS)At: Monterey, CA","Projects: Power System Dynamic State Estimation Using SynchrophasorsOptimal PMU Placement"],"references":["301819821_Comparing_Kalman_Filters_and_Observers_for_Dynamic_State_Estimation_with_Model_Uncertainty_and_Malicious_Cyber_Attacks","299694732_Optimal_Placement_of_Dynamic_Var_Sources_by_Using_Empirical_Controllability_Covariance","292608074_Power_System_Observability_and_Dynamic_State_Estimation_for_Stability_Monitoring_Using_Synchrophasor_Measurements","287249780_Power_System_Differential-Algebraic_Equations","282181181_Dynamic_State_Estimation_for_Multi-Machine_Power_System_by_Unscented_Kalman_Filter_With_Enhanced_Numerical_Stability","281363385_Comparing_Kalman_Filters_and_Observers_for_Power_System_Dynamic_State_Estimation_With_Model_Uncertainty_and_Malicious_Cyber_Attacks","281363187_Risk_Mitigation_for_Dynamic_State_Estimation_Against_Cyber_Attacks_and_Unknown_Inputs","318511289_Power_System_Toolbox","286273420_Optimal_sensor_placement_for_data_assimilations","280780777_Nondominated_sorting_genetic_algorithm_for_optimal_phasor_measurement_placement"]}
