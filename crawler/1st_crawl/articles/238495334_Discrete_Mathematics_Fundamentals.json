{"id":"238495334_Discrete_Mathematics_Fundamentals","abstract":"A graph (undirected) can be defined as a pair (V, E) where V is a non-empty finite set and E is a family of distinct unordered pairs of distinct elements of V. Elements of V are called vertices and elements of E are called edges. A graph is normally represented schematically as points and lines joining some of these points. The points are associated\nwith vertices of a graph, whereas, lines joining pairs of points are associated with its edges. Figure 1.1 shows a graph with\n5 vertices and 6 edges, with {1,2,3,4,5} being its vertex set and {{1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {1,5}} being a family of its\nedges. The number of vertices in a graph is called the order of the graph.","authors":["V. Feinberg","A. Levin","E. Rabinovich"],"meta":["January 1997","DOI:10.1007/978-94-011-5740-7_2"],"references":[]}
