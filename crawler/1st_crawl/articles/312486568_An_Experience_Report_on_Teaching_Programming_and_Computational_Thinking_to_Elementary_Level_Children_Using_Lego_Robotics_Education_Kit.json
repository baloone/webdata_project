{"id":"312486568_An_Experience_Report_on_Teaching_Programming_and_Computational_Thinking_to_Elementary_Level_Children_Using_Lego_Robotics_Education_Kit","abstract":"We present our approach and experiences in teaching computational thinking, problem solving, team-work and project management skills to several elementary level children using Lego Mindstorms EV3 robotics education kit. We taught students how to design, construct and program robots using components such as motors, sensors, wheels, axles, beams, connectors and gears. Students also gained knowledge on basic programming constructs such as control flow, loops, branches and conditions using a visual programming environment. We carefully observed how students performed various tasks and solved problems. We present experimental results which demonstrates that our teaching methodology consisting of both the course content and pedagogy was useful in imparting the desired skills and knowledge to elementary level children.","authors":["Vidushi Chaudhary","Vishnu Agrawal","Pragya Sureka","Ashish Sureka"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/T4E.2016.016","Conference: 2016 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E)"],"references":["262310824_Using_Robotics_to_Motivate_'Back_Door'_Learning","260587092_Building_Young_Engineers_TASEM_for_Third_Graders_in_Woodcreek_Magnet_Elementary_School","254049386_Evaluation_of_a_K-8_LEGO_robotics_program","224587501_Generation_NXT_Building_young_engineers_with_LEGOs","224459872_Using_LEGO_robots_with_LabVIEW_for_a_summer_school_on_mechatronics","4246427_Educating_C_Language_using_LEGO_mindstorms_Robotic_Invention_System_20"]}
