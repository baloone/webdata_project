{"id":"345726320_Venus_Mars_and_Math_Gender_Societal_Affluence_and_Eighth_Graders'_Aspirations_for_STEM","abstract":"The author explores how the gender gap in aspirations for scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) work changes with societal affluence. Over-time data on cohorts of eighth graders in 32 countries reveal that aspirations for mathematically related work become more gender differentiated as societal affluence grows. This relationship holds controlling for students’ social class backgrounds, mathematical achievement, and affinity for school, and it is not explained by cross-national differences in the economic integration of women, gender stereotyping of science, or Internet access. Observed patterns of gender segregation reflect more than just women’s greater freedom to indulge tastes for non-STEM work in affluent societies; tastes are themselves more gendered in these contexts.","authors":["Maria Charles"],"meta":["December 2017Socius Sociological Research for a Dynamic World 3(5152):237802311769717","DOI:10.1177/2378023117697179"],"references":["304033721_The_Consequences_of_the_National_Math_and_Science_Performance_Environment_for_Gender_Differences_in_STEM_Aspiration","344552724_Paying_for_the_Party_How_College_Maintains_Inequality","309822898_Logistic_Regression_Why_We_Cannot_Do_What_We_Think_We_Can_Do_and_What_We_Can_Do_About_It","309021383_Why_are_some_STEM_fields_more_gender_balanced_than_others","308276637_The_Persistence_of_Extreme_Gender_Segregation_in_the_Twenty-first_Century","297669655_WOMEN_IN_SCIENCE_94_-_SURPRISES_ACROSS_THE_CULTURAL_DIVIDE","287498012_Self-Help_Inc_Makeover_Culture_in_American_Life","287276341_The_Rise_of_Women_The_Growing_Gender_Gap_in_Education_and_What_It_Means_for_American_Schools","286518253_Gender-Class_Equality_in_Political_Economies","286177402_Framed_By_Gender_How_Gender_Inequality_Persists_in_the_Modern_World"]}
