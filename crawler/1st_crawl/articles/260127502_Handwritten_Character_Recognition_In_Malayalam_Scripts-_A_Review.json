{"id":"260127502_Handwritten_Character_Recognition_In_Malayalam_Scripts-_A_Review","abstract":"Handwritten character recognition is one of the most challenging and ongoing\nareas of research in the field of pattern recognition. HCR research is matured\nfor foreign languages like Chinese and Japanese but the problem is much more\ncomplex for Indian languages. The problem becomes even more complicated for\nSouth Indian languages due to its large character set and the presence of\nvowels modifiers and compound characters. This paper provides an overview of\nimportant contributions and advances in offline as well as online handwritten\ncharacter recognition of Malayalam scripts.","authors":["Anitha Chacko","Dhanya Pm"],"meta":["February 2014International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications 5(1)","DOI:10.5121/ijaia.2014.5106","SourcearXiv","Project: Combining Classifiers for Offline Malayalam Character Recognition"],"references":["271618883_Unconstrained_Handwritten_Malayalam_Character_Recognition_using_Wavelet_Transform_and_Support_vector_Machine_Classifier","267844226_CHAIN_CODE_AND_HOLISTIC_FEATURES_BASED_OCR_SYSTEM_FOR_PRINTED_DEVANAGARI_SCRIPT_USING_ANN_AND_SVM","305437251_An_Introduction_to_Digital_Image_Processing","285497625_Malayalam_Offline_Handwritten_Recognition_Using_Probabilistic_Simplified_Fuzzy_ARTMAP","281196790_Modified_quadratic_classifier_and_directional_features_for_handwritten_Malayalam_character_recognition","262281003_Online_handwritten_character_recognition_for_Malayalam","261429485_On-line_Malayalam_handwritten_character_recognition_using_HMM_and_SVM","261191910_Online_sequential_extreme_learning_machine_based_handwritten_character_recognition","261052883_Malayalam_online_handwriting_recognition_system_A_simplified_fuzzy_ARTMAP_approach","257796124_Handwritten_character_recognition_using_wavelet_energy_and_extreme_learning_machine"]}
