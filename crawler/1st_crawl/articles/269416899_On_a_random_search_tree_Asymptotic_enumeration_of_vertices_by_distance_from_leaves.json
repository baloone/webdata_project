{"id":"269416899_On_a_random_search_tree_Asymptotic_enumeration_of_vertices_by_distance_from_leaves","abstract":"A random binary search tree grown from the uniformly random permutation of\n$[n]$ is studied. We analyze the exact and asymptotic counts of vertices by\nrank, the distance from the set of leaves. The asymptotic fraction $c_k$ of\nvertices of a fixed rank $k\\ge 0$ is shown to decay exponentially with $k$.\nNotoriously hard to compute, the exact fractions $c_k$ had been determined for\n$k\\le 3$ only. We computed $c_4$ and $c_5$ as well; both are ratios of enormous\nintegers, denominator of $c_5$ being $274$ digits long. Prompted by the data,\nwe proved that, in sharp contrast, the largest prime divisor of $c_k$'s\ndenominator is $2^{k+1}+1$ at most. We conjecture that, in fact, the prime\ndivisors of every denominator for $k>1$ form a single interval, from $2$ to the\nlargest prime not exceeding $2^{k+1}+1$.","authors":["Miklós Bóna","Boris Pittel"],"meta":["December 2014Advances in Applied Probability 49(03)","DOI:10.1017/apr.2017.24","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257299329_Protected_nodes_and_fringe_subtrees_in_some_random_trees","276083687_Asymptotic_Properties_of_Protected_Nodes_in_Random_Recursive_Trees","267120942_Random_trees_An_interplay_between_combinatorics_and_probability","261065509_Asymptotic_distribution_of_two-protected_nodes_in_ternary_search_trees","257294253_Asymptotic_distribution_of_two-protected_nodes_in_random_binary_search_trees","242910270_Note_on_the_height_of_random_recursive_trees_and_m-ary_search_trees","242622538_On_growing_random_binary_trees1","238727204_On_the_Most_Probable_Shape_of_a_Search_Tree_Grown_from_a_Random_Permutation","236263770_K-Protected_vertices_in_binary_search_trees","227705379_Limit_Laws_for_Local_Counters_in_Random_Binary_Search_Tree","226830234_Moment_of_extinction_of_a_branching_process_and_height_of_a_random_tree","220693528_Analytic_Combinatorics","220431052_A_note_on_the_height_of_binary_search_trees","220345191_A_local_limit_theorem_for_the_number_of_nodes_the_height_and_the_number_of_final_leaves_in_a_critical_branching_process_tree","51952343_On_protected_nodes_in_Digital_Search_Trees","38363009_Asymptotic_Fringe_Distributions_for_General_Families_of_Random_Trees","2559708_Analytic_Combinatorics"]}
