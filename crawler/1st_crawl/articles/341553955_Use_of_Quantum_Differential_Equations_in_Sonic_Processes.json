{"id":"341553955_Use_of_Quantum_Differential_Equations_in_Sonic_Processes","abstract":"Emerging as a new field, quantum computation has reinvented the fundamentals of Computer Science and knowledge theory in a manner consistent with quantum physics. The fact that quantum computation has superior features and new events than classical computation provides benefits in proving mathematical theories. With advances in technology, the nonlinear partial differential equations are used in almost every area, and many difficulties have been overcome by the solutions of these equations. In particular, the complex solutions of KdV and Burgers equations have been shown to be used in modeling a simple turbulence flow. In this study, Burger-like equation with complex solutions is defined in Hilbert space and solved with an example. In addition, these solutions were analyzed. Thanks to the Quantum Burgers-Like equation, the nonlinear differential equation is solved by linearizing. The pattern changes of time made the result linear. This means that the Quantum Burgers-Like equation can be used to smoothen the sonic processing.","authors":["M.Tuncay Gençoğlu","Praveen Agarwal"],"meta":["April 2020Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences 6(1)","DOI:10.2478/AMNS.2020.2.00003"],"references":["319307991_On_new_traveling_wave_solutions_of_the_Hirota-Satsuma_coupled_KdV_equation","297893265_Two_analytical_methods_for_time-fractional_nonlinear_coupled_Boussinesq-Burger's_equations_arise_in_propagation_of_shallow_water_waves","287292678_G'G-Expansion_method_for_31-dimensional_burgers_and_burgers_like_equations","2190050_Experimental_Demonstration_of_Quantum_Lattice_Gas_Computation","317289253_Application_of_Extended_Adomian_Decomposition_Method_and_Extended_Variational_Iteration_Method_to_Hirota-Satsuma_Coupled_KdV_Equation","303283587_Complex_Solutions_for_Ninth-Order_Korteweg-de_Vries_nKdv_Equation_and_2-dimensional_Burgers_equation","286170418_Complex_Solutions_for_Burgers-Like_Equation","257413726_A_direct_algebraic_method_applied_to_obtain_complex_solutions_of_some_nonlinear_partial_differential_equations","223706873_Application_of_a_homogeneous_balance_method_to_exact_solutions_of_nonlinear_equations_in_mathematical_physics","222289312_Exact_solutions_for_a_compound_KdV-Burgers_equation"]}
