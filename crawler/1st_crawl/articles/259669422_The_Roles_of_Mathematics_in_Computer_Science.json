{"id":"259669422_The_Roles_of_Mathematics_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"There is evidence that the day-to-day practice of computer science involves little if any use of mathematics, despite numerous connections between the disciplines. This gap between mathâ€™s practical and intellectual roles in computer science leads to an awkward place for mathematics in undergraduate computer science curricula--required mathematics courses align poorly with the needs of computer science, and students study lots of math but relatively few computer science courses use it. Computer science graduates are therefore unwilling and unable to apply mathematics on the job. Fortunately, small local changes can strike directly at major contributors to the problem.","authors":["Doug Baldwin","Henry M. Walker","Peter B.
