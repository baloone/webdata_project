{"id":"272422799_Maximal_Independent_Sets_in_Generalised_Caterpillar_Graphs","abstract":"A caterpillar graph is a tree which on removal of all its pendant vertices\nleaves a chordless path. The chordless path is called the backbone of the\ngraph. The edges from the backbone to the pendant vertices are called the hairs\nof the caterpillar graph. Ortiz and Villanueva (C.Ortiz and M.Villanueva,\nDiscrete Applied Mathematics, 160(3): 259-266, 2012) describe an algorithm,\nlinear in the size of the output, for finding a family of maximal independent\nsets in a caterpillar graph.\nIn this paper, we propose an algorithm, again linear in the output size, for\na generalised caterpillar graph, where at each vertex of the backbone, there\ncan be any number of hairs of length one and at most one hair of length two.","authors":["Neethi K.
