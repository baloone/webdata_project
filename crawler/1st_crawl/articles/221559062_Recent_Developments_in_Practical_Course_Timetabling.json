{"id":"221559062_Recent_Developments_in_Practical_Course_Timetabling","abstract":"Course timetabling is a multi-dimensional NP-Complete problem that has generated hundreds of papers and thousands of students\nhave attempted to solve it for their own school. In this paper, we describe the major components of the course timetabling\nproblem. We discuss some of the primary types of algorithms that have been applied to these problems. We provide a series\nof tables listing papers in refereed journals that have either implemented a solution or tested their algorithm on real data.\nWe made no attempt to provide a qualitative comparison. We restricted our presentation to a description of the types of technique\nused and the size of problem solved We have not included commercial software vendors","authors":["Michael W.
