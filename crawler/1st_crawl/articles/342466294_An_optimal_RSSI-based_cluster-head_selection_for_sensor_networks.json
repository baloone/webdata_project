{"id":"342466294_An_optimal_RSSI-based_cluster-head_selection_for_sensor_networks","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming a very auspicious key to better address reliability to constant, accurate environmental monitoring. Although energy utilisation is one of the most common challenges, frequent communication between the sensor nodes (SNs) results in a huge energy drain. Moreover, load balancing and optimisation within the WSN are the significant factors for the extensive period of network lifetime. In fact, many such networks are deployed and operating outdoors is exposed to varying environmental conditions, which may further set grounds for severe performance degradation. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration factors like radio signal strength index to reduce the impact and to adapt to varying environmental condition ns. In this paper, we propose an optimal RSSI CH selection (ORCHS) algorithm that is also based on environmental conditions to achieve energy efficiency and enhanced network lifetime by effectively managing energy levels within the network. reviewers for reputed journals like IEEE, Springer, etc. He has been guiding several international and national computer science PhD and MTech scholars in the areas networking, clouding computing.","authors":["Khushboo Jain","Anoop Kumar"],"meta":["November 2019International Journal of Adaptive and Innovative Systems 2(4):349-361","DOI:10.1504/IJAIS.2019.10030287"],"references":["333401751_A_Heterogeneous_Energy_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Clustering_Protocol","328389319_Data_Aggregation_Design_Goals_for_Monitoring_Data_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","325967075_Design_Issues_and_Challenges_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","325966558_A_Novel_Energy-Efficient_Protocol_for_WSN_based_on_Optimal_Chain_Routing","304371214_Energy-efficient_fuzzy_logic_cluster_head_selection_in_wireless_sensor_networks","332337778_A_priority-based_weighted_clustering_algorithm_for_mobile_ad_hoc_network","330861237_Residual_Energy_Based_Cluster-head_Selection_in_WSNs_for_IoT_Application","322692618_Energy-efficient_clustering_algorithm_for_structured_wireless_sensor_networks","322128476_Zonal_based_approach_for_clustering_in_heterogeneous_WSN","320097888_Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","282546426_Energy_Efficient_Clustering_Protocol_Using_Fuzzy_Logic_for_Heterogeneous_WSNs","281307379_A_Fuzzy_Logic-Based_Clustering_Algorithm_for_WSN_to_Extend_the_Network_Lifetime","221081380_Contiki_-_A_Lightweight_and_Flexible_Operating_System_for_Tiny_Networked_Sensors","266082662_SEECH_Scalable_Energy_Efficient_Clustering_Hierarchy_Protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224327815_Study_of_characteristics_of_RSSI_signal"]}
