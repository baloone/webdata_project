{"id":"317365858_Students'_and_Teachers'_Experiences_With_the_Implementation_of_Problem-Based_Learning_at_a_University_Law_School","abstract":"A few years ago, the Erasmus School of Law implemented problem-based learning (PBL) as an instructional method in the bachelorâ€™s program. Transition to a PBL program often brings some difficulties for the teaching staff. To find out whether the implementation at the Erasmus School of Law has been successful, students and teachers were asked about their experiences with and perceptions of the PBL program. Both students and teachers reported positive study behaviors, such as regular studying and active involvement of students as a result of PBL. However, some issues also arose after implementintig PBL: staff members reported dissatisfaction regarding the PBL program and students reported feelings of insufficient preparation for the legal profession. Recommendations on how to address these issues are discussed.","authors":["Marit Wijnen","Sofie M. M.
