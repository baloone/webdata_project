{"id":"275054873_Sparse_multivariate_polynomial_interpolation_in_the_basis_of_Schubert_polynomials","abstract":"Schubert polynomials were discovered by A. Lascoux and M. Sch\\\"utzenberger in\nthe study of cohomology rings of flag manifolds in 1980's. These polynomials\nform a linear basis of multivariate polynomials, and yield a natural\ngeneralization of the classical Newton interpolation formula to the\nmultivariate case.\nIn this paper we first show that evaluating Schubert polynomials over\nnonnegative integral inputs is in $\\#\\mathrm{P}$. Our main result is a\ndeterministic algorithm that computes the expansion of a polynomial $f$ of\ndegree $d$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$ in the basis of Schubert\npolynomials, assuming an oracle computing Schubert polynomials. This algorithm\nruns in time polynomial in $n$, $d$, and the bit size of the expansion. This\ngeneralizes the sparse interpolation algorithm of symmetric polynomials in the\nSchur basis by Barvinok and Fomin (Advances in Applied Mathematics,\n18(3):271--285).\nCombining the two results, we can compute the coefficients in the expansion\nof products of two Schubert polynomials in the Schubert basis, of which the\nLittlewood-Richardson coefficients are a special case.","authors":["Priyanka Mukhopadhyay","Youming Qiao"],"meta":["December 2017computational complexity 26(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-016-0142-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["277019850_A_Structured_View_on_Weighted_Counting_with_Relations_to_Quantum_Computation_and_Applications","265988558_Completeness_and_Reduction_in_Algebraic_Complexity_Theory","261469582_Random_Arithmetic_Formulas_Can_Be_Reconstructed_Efficiently","344058463_Read-once_polynomial_identity_testing","321507343_Completeness_and_Reduction_in_Algebraic_Complexity_Theory","265817567_Symmetric_functions_Schubert_polynomials_and_degeneracy_loci","262264136_A_combinatorial_proof_that_Schubert_vs_Schur_coefficients_are_nonnegative","257575623_Geometric_complexity_theory_III_On_deciding_nonvanishing_of_a_Littlewood-Richardson_coefficient","247689645_Symmetric_Functions_and_Combinatorial_Operators_on_Polynomials","241623663_Affine_projections_of_polynomials_extended_abstract","239761526_Reconstruction_of_depth-4_multilinear_circuits_with_top_fan-in_2","234800463_A_deterministic_algorithm_for_sparse_multivariate_polynomial_interpolation","241148015_Schubert_and_Macdonald_Polynomials_a_parallel","239665958_Notes_on_Schubert_Polynomials","231609249_Schur_Times_Schubert_via_the_Fomin-Kirillov_Algebra"]}
