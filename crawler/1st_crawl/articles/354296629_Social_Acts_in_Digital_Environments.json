{"id":"354296629_Social_Acts_in_Digital_Environments","abstract":"Adolf Reinach's theory of social acts and Czes≈Çaw Znamierowski theory of the environment can show a new perspective of analysis in the felds of computer science and digital communication. This paper will begin analysing the performance of social acts in two categories of digital environments: (i) fctional digital environment and (ii) real digital environment. The analysis will be supported by examples from the history of computer science. In both kinds of digital environments, organigrams play a signifcant role and depend on the users' digital power to perform a real or fctional social act. Finally, the paper will analyse one of the possible roles that AI plays in performing social acts in digital environments. It will show how AI could affect the perception of social acts.","authors":["Andrea Addis","Olimpia Giuliana Loddo","Massimiliano Saba"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.17454/pam-2006"],"references":["313943398_Social_Ontologies_Online_The_Representation_of_Social_Structures_on_the_Internet","288628159_Meta-institutional_Concepts_A_new_Category_for_Social_Ontology","340836568_Digitalization_for_Value_Creation_Corporate_Culture_for_a_Digital_World","338922978_Ruling_without_Rules_Not_Only_Nudges_Regulation_beyond_Normativity","312893836_Die_apriorischen_Grundlagen_des_burgerlichen_Rechts","308299901_Czeslaw_Znamierowski's_Social_Ontology_and_Its_Phenomenological_Roots","292529871_Internet_Governance_The_New_Frontier_of_Global_Institutions","292077855_The_role_of_social_platforms_in_transforming_service_ecosystems","259882692_Video_Games_Do_Affect_Social_Outcomes_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_the_Effects_of_Violent_and_Prosocial_Video_Game_Play","257930123_The_impact_of_preprocessing_on_text_classification","224952248_Machine_Learning_in_Automated_Text_Categorization","222826601_How_long_until_human-level_AI_Results_from_an_expert_assessment","243770526_Possible_Worlds_The_Social_Dynamic_of_Virtual_Reality_Technology","222286150_Beyond_griefing_Virtual_crime","221393624_From_here_to_human-level_AI"]}
