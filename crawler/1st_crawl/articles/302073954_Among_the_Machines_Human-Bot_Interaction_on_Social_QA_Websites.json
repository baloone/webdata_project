{"id":"302073954_Among_the_Machines_Human-Bot_Interaction_on_Social_QA_Websites","abstract":"With the rise of social media and advancements in AI technology, human-bot interaction will soon be commonplace. In this paper we explore human-bot interaction in Stack Overflow, a question and answer website for developers. For this purpose, we built a bot emulating an ordinary user answering questions concerning the resolution of git error messages. In a first run this bot impersonated a human, while in a second run the same bot revealed its machine identity. Despite being functionally identical, the two bot variants elicited quite different reactions.","authors":["Alessandro Murgia","Daan Janssens","Serge Demeyer","Bogdan Vasilescu"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1145/2851581.2892311","Conference: CHI 2016 Extended Abstracts: ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing SystemsAt: San Jose, CA, USA"],"references":["276460565_How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_the_Bots","268803878_Welcoming_Our_Robot_Overlords_Initial_Expectations_About_Interaction_With_a_Robot","264799729_EnTagRec_An_Enhanced_Tag_Recommendation_System_for_Software_Information_Sites","264123205_The_Rise_of_Social_Bots","257252800_Are_Computers_Good_or_Bad_for_Business_How_Mediated_Customer-Computer_Interaction_Alters_Emotion_Impressions_and_Patronage_toward_Organizations","254004076_Socialbots_Voices_from_the_fronts","247744084_Interpersonal_Expectations_Expectancy_Violations_and_Emotional_Communication","221517042_Computer_are_social_actors","220089625_Towards_A_More_Robust_Theory_and_Measure_of_Social_Presence_Review_and_Suggested_Criteria","318494451_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","274838283_Interacting_with_bots_online_Users'_reactions_to_actions_of_automated_programs_in_Wikipedia","271019581_Extracting_Development_Tasks_to_Navigate_Software_Documentation","266656095_Live_API_documentation","261449226_Why_when_and_what_Analyzing_Stack_Overflow_questions_by_topic_type_and_code","260792479_Is_that_a_bot_running_the_social_media_feed_Testing_the_differences_in_perceptions_of_communication_quality_for_a_human_agent_and_a_bot_agent_on_Twitter","257582303_Design_and_analysis_of_a_social_botnet","230876454_Scripts_Plans_Goals_and_Understanding","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","220495496_Social_reactions_toward_people_vs_computers_How_mere_lables_shape_interactions","220495076_Social_organization_in_virtual_settings_depends_on_proximity_to_human_visual_aspect","220426816_ELIZA_-_A_Computer_Program_For_the_Study_of_Natural_Language_Communication_Between_Man_And_Machine_Reprint","220421826_Wiezenbaum_J_ELIZA_-_A_computer_Program_For_the_Study_of_Natural_Language_Communication_Between_Man_and_Machine_Communications_of_the_ACM_91_36-45","49304163_The_Attraction_Paradigm"]}
