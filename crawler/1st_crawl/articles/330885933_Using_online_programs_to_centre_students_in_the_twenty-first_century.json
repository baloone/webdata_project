{"id":"330885933_Using_online_programs_to_centre_students_in_the_twenty-first_century","abstract":"Because of the exponential growth of the internet and ICT, we, as promoters of education, should always be aware of the changes that society is endorsing outside of the classroom. The student is no longer the same introverted child that studied in the workbenches years ago. Today students belong to a time with smartphones, tablets, and a wide range of new portable technologies. Today's students are used to seeking different forms and ways of motivation in and out of the classroom, and they want the teaching and learning process to integrate with society and its latest technologies. The number of internet users has increased tenfold from 1999 to 2014. The first billion was reached in 2005, the second billion in 2010, the third billion in 2014. This means access to the world wide web is increasing rapidly. In 2020, the percentage will rise again, and consequently, an incredibly large number of people, youngsters and adults, will have access to the internet. The slogan that drives the world today is anywhere... anytime!.","authors":["Pedro Tadeu","Carlos J. G. Brigas"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.4018/978-1-5225-5085-3.ch005"],"references":[]}
