{"id":"259441022_Total_Variation_with_Overlapping_Group_Sparsity_for_Image_Deblurring_under_Impulse_Noise","abstract":"The total variation (TV) regularization method is an effective method for\nimage deblurring in preserving edges. However, the TV based solutions usually\nhave some staircase effects. In this paper, in order to alleviate the staircase\neffect, we propose a new model for restoring blurred images with impulse noise.\nThe model consists of an $\\ell_1$-fidelity term and a TV with overlapping group\nsparsity (OGS) regularization term. Moreover, we impose a box constraint to the\nproposed model for getting more accurate solutions. An efficient and effective\nalgorithm is proposed to solve the model under the framework of the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM). We use an inner loop which is nested\ninside the majorization minimization (MM) iteration for the subproblem of the\nproposed method. Compared with other methods, numerical results illustrate that\nthe proposed method, can significantly improve the restoration quality, both in\navoiding staircase effects and in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)\nand relative error (ReE).","authors":["Gang Liu","Ting-Zhu Huang","Jun Liu","Xiao-Guang Lv"],"meta":["December 2013PLoS ONE 10(4)","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0122562","SourcearXiv"],"references":["321512672_Numerical_Methods_for_Nonlinear_Variational_Problems","313157156_Fast_alternating_direction_optimization_methods","285906939_Numerical_optimization","281333644_An_efficient_primal-dual_method_for_L1TV_image_restoration","278282637_An_algorithm_for_total_variation_minimization_and_applications","269634033_Affine_Invariant_Flows_in_the_Beltrami_Framework","268178381_Group_Sparsity_with_Overlapping_Partition_Functions","267661784_Constrained_Total_Variation_Deblurring_Models_and_Fast_Algorithms_Based_on_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers","265357491_Numerical_Methods_for_the_Solution_of_Ill-Posed_Problems","265201153_Fast_Alternating_Direction_Optimization_Methods"]}
