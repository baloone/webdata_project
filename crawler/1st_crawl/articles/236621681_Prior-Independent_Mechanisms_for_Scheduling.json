{"id":"236621681_Prior-Independent_Mechanisms_for_Scheduling","abstract":"We study the makespan minimization problem with unrelated selfish machines\nunder the assumption that job sizes are stochastic. We design simple truthful\nmechanisms that under various distributional assumptions provide constant and\nsublogarithmic approximations to expected makespan. Our mechanisms are\nprior-independent in that they do not rely on knowledge of the job size\ndistributions. Prior-independent approximation mechanisms have been previously\nstudied for the objective of revenue maximization [Dhangwatnotai, Roughgarden\nand Yan'10, Devanur, Hartline, Karlin and Nguyen'11, Roughgarden, Talgam-Cohen\nand Yan'12]. In contrast to our results, in prior-free settings no truthful\nanonymous deterministic mechanism for the makespan objective can provide a\nsublinear approximation [Ashlagi, Dobzinski and Lavi'09].","authors":["Shuchi Chawla","Jason D.
