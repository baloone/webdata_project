{"id":"290619774_Viewpoints_on_learning_and_education_with_simulation_games","abstract":"This paper deals with some psychological and educational viewpoints on learning with simulation games. First, I will give a short description of simulation games as they relate to learning and education. Second, the focus will be on the model of the experiental learning through simulation games. The aim is to give an overview of what happens in a simulation gaming process and to understand the learning cycle from the perspective of the participants of the game. Third, a short literature review on the educational effects of simulation games will be presented. Finally, I will summarize some viewpoints on behalf of using simulation games and make suggestions for further studies.","authors":["Virpi Ruohom√§ki"],"meta":["January 1995","DOI:10.1007/978-1-5041-2870-4_2","In book: Simulation Games and Learning in Production Management (pp.13-25)"],"references":["280293040_Where_are_we_An_Analysis_of_the_Methods_and_Focus_of_the_Research_on_Simulation_Gaming","275781305_Games_for_Society_Business_and_War_Towards_a_Theory_of_Gaming","274206559_Teaching_With_Simulation_Games_A_Review_of_Claims_and_Evidence","247739775_The_Educational_Effectiveness_of_Simulation_Games_A_Synthesis_of_Findings","246137204_Experiential_learning_experience_in_the_source_of_learning_and","234616104_Promoting_Learning_Through_Games_and_Simulations","234609642_Assessing_the_Impact_of_Simulation_Games_on_Learning_A_Step-by-Step_Approach","232592132_A_Quantitative_Review_of_Research_on_Instructional_Simulation_Gaming_A_Twenty-Year_Perspective","232553957_Simulation_and_Games_in_Training_and_Development_Status_and_Concerns_About_Their_Use","232545358_Designing_Simulation_Games_To_Teach_Decision-Making_Skills","221336920_Games_in_Production_Management","220017454_Reflection_Turning_Experience_Into_Learning","201382103_The_Effectiveness_of_Games_for_Educational_Purposes_A_Review_of_Recent_Research"]}
