{"id":"267812027_On_the_Read-Once_Property_of_Branching_Programs_and_CNFs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","abstract":"In this paper we prove a space lower bound of $n^{\\Omega(k)}$ for\nnon-deterministic (syntactic) read-once branching programs ({\\sc nrobp}s) on\nfunctions expressible as {\\sc cnf}s with treewidth at most $k$ of their primal\ngraphs. This lower bound rules out the possibility of fixed-parameter space\ncomplexity of {\\sc nrobp}s parameterized by $k$.\nWe use lower bound for {\\sc nrobp}s to obtain a quasi-polynomial separation\nbetween Free Binary Decision Diagrams and Decision Decomposable Negation Normal\nForms, essentially matching the existing upper bound introduced by Beame et al.\nand thus proving the tightness of the latter.","authors":["Igor Razgon"],"meta":["November 2014Algorithmica 75(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-015-0059-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257069471_Lower_Bounds_for_Exact_Model_Counting_and_Applications_in_Probabilistic_Databases","241623395_On_the_tractability_of_query_compilation_and_bounded_treewidth","236260582_New_width_parameters_of_graphs","220896401_Treewidth_in_Verification_Local_vs_Global","2570039_Symbolic_Boolean_Manipulation_with_Ordered_Binary_Decision_Diagrams","2540262_A_Knowledge_Compilation_Map","303787226_On_OBDDs_for_CNFs_of_bounded_treewidth","289023323_CV-width_A_new_complexity_parameter_for_CNFs","278655725_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","268079446_Expander_CNFs_have_Exponential_DNNF_Size","258817211_Cliquewidth_and_Knowledge_Compilation","255971731_On_OBDDs_for_CNFs_of_bounded_treewidth","242306588_Boolean_Function_Complexity_Advances_and_Frontiers","238198448_Branching_Programs_and_Binary_Decision_Diagrams-Theory_and_Applications","221591359_Read-Once_Branching_Programs_Rectangular_Proofs_of_the_Pigeonhole_Principle_and_the_Transversal_Calculus","221403593_Hierarchical_Representations_of_Discrete_Functions_with_Application_to_Model_Checking","220814030_SDD_A_New_Canonical_Representation_of_Propositional_Knowledge_Bases","220695947_Branching_Programs_and_Binary_Decision_Diagrams","220431693_Decomposable_negation_normal_form","220137932_A_Note_on_Read-k_Times_Branching_Programs","51910697_A_Knowledge_Compilation_Map","2309643_Lower_Bounds_for_Deterministic_and_Nondeterministic_Branching_Programs"]}
