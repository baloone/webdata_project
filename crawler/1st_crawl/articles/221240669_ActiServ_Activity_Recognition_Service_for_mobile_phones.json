{"id":"221240669_ActiServ_Activity_Recognition_Service_for_mobile_phones","abstract":"Smart phones have become a powerful platform for wearable context recognition. We present a service-based recognition architecture which creates an evolving classification system using feedback from the user community. The approach utilizes classifiers based on fuzzy inference systems which use live annotation to personalize the classifier instance on the device. Our recognition system is designed for everyday use: it allows flexible placement of the device (no assumed or fixed position), requires only minimal personalization effort from the user (1-3 minutes per activity) and is capable of detecting a high number of activities. The components of the service are shown in an evaluation scenario, in which recognition rates up to 97% can be achieved for ten activity classes.","authors":["Martin Berchtold","Matthias Budde","Dawud Gordon","H.
