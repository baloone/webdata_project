{"id":"328632266_GiPlot_An_interactive_cloud-based_tool_for_visualizing_and_interpreting_large_spectral_data_sets","abstract":"Latest advances in technology and the growing amount of experimental and business data have increased the number of users accessing on-line tools dedicated to quickly visualize and analyse large data sets. This paper describes the development and functionality of a new interactive cloud computing based plotting tool (GiPlot - Google-based Interactive Plot) easy-to-use for universal data. It has interactive features that facilitate data share and interpretation, and selection of specific data suitable for further uses and detailed studies. It also allows quick and step-by-step visualizations of the impact of various experimental conditions on spectral data sets. For a detailed illustration of the features of this interactive plotting tool, we have used mainly spectral data for a given solute dissolved in mixed solvents and for changes in the absorption and/or fluorescence properties of a solute solution in the presence of different chemical stimuli. The most important features and functionalities of this new tool have also been summarized and suggestively highlighted through a short collection of video tutorials containing many examples, developed by the authors of this paper as a support for both the tool and this paper.","authors":["Daniel Homocianu","Mihaela Homocianu (born Lupu)"],"meta":["October 2018Spectrochimica Acta Part A Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy 209","DOI:10.1016/j.saa.2018.10.046"],"references":[]}
