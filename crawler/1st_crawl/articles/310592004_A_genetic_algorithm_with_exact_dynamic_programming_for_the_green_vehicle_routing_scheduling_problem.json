{"id":"310592004_A_genetic_algorithm_with_exact_dynamic_programming_for_the_green_vehicle_routing_scheduling_problem","abstract":"Traffic congestion significantly increases CO2 (a well-known greenhouse gas) emissions of vehicles in road transportation and causes other environmental costs as well. A road-based delivery company can reduce its CO2 emissions through operational decisions such as efficient vehicle routes and delivery schedules by considering time-varying traffic congestion in its service area. In this paper, we study the time-dependent vehicle routing & scheduling problem with CO2 emissions optimization (TD-VRSP-CO2) and develop an exact dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal vehicle schedules for given vehicle routes. A hybrid solution approach that combines a genetic algorithm with the exact dynamic programming procedure (GA-DP) is proposed as an efficient solution approach for the TD-VRSP-CO2. Computational experiments on 30 small-sized instances and 14 large-sized instances are used to study the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid optimization approach with promising results. Contributions of this study can help road-based delivery companies be ready for a low-carbon economy and also help individual vehicle drivers make better vehicle scheduling plans with lower CO2 emissions and fuel consumption.","authors":["Yiyong Xiao","Abdullah Konak"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Cleaner Production 167","DOI:10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.11.115"],"references":["283052309_Green_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time-Varying_Tra_ffic_Congestion","276454785_Inter-city_passenger_transport_in_larger_urban_agglomeration_area_Emissions_and_health_impacts","310594252_Methodology_for_calculating_transport_emissions_and_energy_consumption","303170354_Vehicle_routing_to_minimize_time-dependent_emissions_in_urban_areas","297659509_The_heterogeneous_green_vehicle_routing_and_scheduling_problem_with_time-varying_traffic_congestion","282563208_Green_initiatives_A_step_towards_sustainable_development_and_firm's_performance_in_the_automobile_industry","277960088_A_simulating_annealing_algorithm_to_solve_the_green_vehicle_routing_scheduling_problem_with_hierarchical_objectives_and_weighted_tardiness","273602005_Low-carbon_city_logistics_distribution_network_design_with_resource_deployment","273601997_Vehicle_fuel_consumption_minimization_in_routing_over-dimensioned_and_overweight_trucks_in_capacitated_transportation_networks","273111325_The_bi-objective_Pollution-Routing_Problem"]}
