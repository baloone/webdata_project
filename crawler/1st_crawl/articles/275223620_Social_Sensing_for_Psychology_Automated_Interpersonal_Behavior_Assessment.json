{"id":"275223620_Social_Sensing_for_Psychology_Automated_Interpersonal_Behavior_Assessment","abstract":"In this article, we show how the use of state-of-the-art methods in computer science based on machine perception and learning allows the unobtrusive capture and automated analysis of interpersonal behavior in real time (social sensing). Given the high ecological validity of the behavioral sensing, the ease of behavioral-cue extraction for large groups over long observation periods in the field, the possibility of investigating completely new research questions, and the ability to provide people with immediate feedback on behavior, social sensing will fundamentally impact psychology.","authors":["Marianne Schmid Mast","Daniel Gatica-Perez","Denise Frauendorfer","Laurent Son Nguyen"],"meta":["April 2015Current Directions in Psychological Science 24(2):154-160","DOI:10.1177/0963721414560811"],"references":["288520753_Life_in_the_network_The_coming_age_of_computational_social_science","279840056_MACH_My_automated_conversation_coach","277682193_Self-Perception_Theory","262363892_Using_self-context_for_multimodal_detection_of_head_nods_in_face-to-face_interactions","262208784_StressSense_Detecting_stress_in_unconstrained_acoustic_environments_using_smartphones","261421162_Gaze_estimation_from_multimodal_Kinect_data","284978438_Self-perception","262356878_Leveraging_visual_feedback_from_social_signal_processing_to_enhance_clinicians'_nonverbal_skills","261852915_Detecting_People_Looking_at_Each_Other_in_Videos","261115604_Body_communicative_cue_extraction_for_conversational_analysis"]}
