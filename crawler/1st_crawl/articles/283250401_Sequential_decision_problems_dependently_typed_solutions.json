{"id":"283250401_Sequential_decision_problems_dependently_typed_solutions","abstract":"We propose a dependently typed formalization for a simple class of sequential decision problems. For this class of problems, we implement a generic version of Bellman's backwards induction algorithm [2] and a machine checkable proof that the proposed implementation is correct. The formalization is generic. It is presented in Idris, but it can be easily translated to other dependently-typed programming languages. We conclude with an informal discussion of the problems we have faced in extending the formalization to generic monadic sequential decision problems.","authors":["Nicola Botta","Cezar Ionescu","E.
