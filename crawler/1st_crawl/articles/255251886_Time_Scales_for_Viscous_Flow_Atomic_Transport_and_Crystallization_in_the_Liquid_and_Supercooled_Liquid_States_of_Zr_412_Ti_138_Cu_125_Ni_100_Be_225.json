At the liquidus temperature we find an extremely high viscosity of 2.5thinspthinspPathinsps, favoring glass formation. At deep supercooling the time scales for the diffusion of small and medium sized atoms as reported in the literature decouple from the internal relaxation time as probed by our viscosity measurements. Similarly, crystallization from the supercooled liquid state can be described with an effective diffusivity that scales with the viscosity at high temperatures and is Arrhenius-like at deep supercooling. {copyright} {ital 1999} {ital The American Physical Society}","authors":["A.
