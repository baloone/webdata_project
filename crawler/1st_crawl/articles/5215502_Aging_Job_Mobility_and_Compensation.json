{"id":"5215502_Aging_Job_Mobility_and_Compensation","abstract":"Age and tenure are negatively correlated with job mobility. Mobility patterns therefore change over the lifetime. In this\npaper we analyze job mobility patterns and the way they change with age and tenure. A novelty is that the effects of financial\nincentives (wage differentials), mobility costs, and non-financial incentives (the shadow price for physically arduous labour)\nare disentangled. It is shown how these elements change with age. The results confirm our hypotheses. The rapid decline in\nmobility with age is simultaneously caused by declining financial gains, rising costs, and a higher shadow price for older\nworkers.","authors":["Wim Groot","Maartje Verberne"],"meta":["July 1997Oxford Economic Papers 49(3):380-403","DOI:10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a028615","SourceRePEc"],"references":["24107978_Why_Is_There_Mandatory_Retirement"]}
