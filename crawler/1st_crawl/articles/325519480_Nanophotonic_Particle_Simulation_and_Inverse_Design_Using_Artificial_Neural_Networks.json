{"id":"325519480_Nanophotonic_Particle_Simulation_and_Inverse_Design_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks","abstract":"We propose a method to use artificial neural networks to approximate light scattering by multilayer nanoparticles. We find that the network needs to be trained on only a small sampling of the data to approximate the simulation to high precision. Once the neural network is trained, it can simulate such optical processes orders of magnitude faster than conventional simulations. Furthermore, the trained neural network can be used to solve nanophotonic inverse design problems by using back propagation, where the gradient is analytical, not numerical.","authors":["John Peurifoy","Yichen Shen","Li Jing","Yi Yang"],"meta":["June 2018Science Advances 4(6):eaar4206","DOI:10.1126/sciadv.aar4206","Project: AI Physicist"],"references":["274403306_Inverse_design_and_demonstration_of_a_compact_and_broadband_on-chip_wavelength_demultiplexer","269040844_The_Loss_Surface_of_Multilayer_Networks","332927446_Training_deep_neural_networks_for_the_inverse_design_of_nanophotonic_structures","319660855_Nanophotonic_Inverse_Design_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network","308152498_An_overview_of_gradient_descent_optimization_algorithms","303859227_Solving_the_Quantum_Many-Body_Problem_with_Artificial_Neural_Networks","272834432_Coherent_Plasmon-Exciton_Coupling_in_Silver_Platelet-J-aggregate_Nanocomposites","257526066_Fast_solution_of_direct_and_inverse_design_problems_concerning_furnace_operation_conditions_in_steel_industry","255813201_Inverse_Design_of_High_Absorption_Thin-Film_Photovoltaic_Materials","253859690_Inverse_and_Algebraic_Quantum_Scattering_Theory"]}
