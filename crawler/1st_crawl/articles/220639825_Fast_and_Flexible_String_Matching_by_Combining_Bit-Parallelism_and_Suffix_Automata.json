{"id":"220639825_Fast_and_Flexible_String_Matching_by_Combining_Bit-Parallelism_and_Suffix_Automata","abstract":"this paper we merge bit-parallelism and suffix automata, so that a nondeterministic suffix automaton is simulated using bit-parallelism. The resulting algorithm, called BNDM, obtains the best from both worlds. It is much simpler to implement than BDM and nearly as simple as Shift-Or. It inherits from Shift-Or the ability to handle flexible patterns and from BDM the ability to skip characters. BNDM is 30%-40% faster than BDM and up to 7 times faster than Shift-Or. When compared to the fastest existing algorithms on exact patterns (which belong to the BM family), BNDM is from 20% slower to 3 times faster, depending on the alphabet size. With respect to flexible pattern searching, BNDM is by far the fastest technique to deal with classes of characters and is competitive to search allowing errors. In particular, BNDM seems very adequate for computational biology applications, since it is the fastest algorithm to search on DNA sequences and flexible searching is an important problem in that","authors":["Gonzalo Navarro","Mathieu Raffinot"],"meta":["December 2000Journal of Experimental Algorithmics 5:4","DOI:10.1145/351827.384246","SourceDBLP"],"references":["227336777_Faster_Approximate_String_Matching","220994320_Speeding_Up_Two_String-Matching_Algorithms","220616992_Approximate_Boyer-Moore_String_Matching","220224482_Speeding_Up_Two_String-Matching_Algorithms","220224077_Faster_Approximate_String_Matching","2779327_Boyer-Moore_strategy_to_efficient_approximate_string_matching","2739507_Text_Retrieval_Theory_and_Practice","312600900_A_New_Approach_to_Text_Searching","290455654_A_new_approach_to_text_searching","288633483_On_the_multi_backward_dawg_matching_algorithm_MultiBDM","268851577_Efficient_String_Matching_with_Don't-Care_Patterns","238719541_Fast_and_practical_approximate_pattern_matching","235047912_String-Matching_and_Other_Products","225877586_A_Subquadratic_Algorithm_for_Approximate_Limited_Expression_Matching","225761472_Fast_Regular_Expression_Search","224960000_A_Fast_String_Searching_Algorithm","223195856_Asymptotic_estimation_of_the_average_number_of_terminal_states_in_DAWGs","222755813_Average_size_of_suffix_trees_and_DAWGS","222496156_Very_fast_and_simple_approximate_string_matching","222461094_Transducers_and_repetitions","221530240_Fast_and_simple_character_classes_and_bounded_gaps_pattern_matching_with_application_to_protein_searching","220618471_Generalized_String_Matching","220618247_Fast_Pattern_Matching_in_Strings","220618222_The_Complexity_of_Pattern_Matching_for_a_Random_String","220424762_A_Very_Fast_Substring_Search_Algorithm","220423613_Fast_Text_Searching_Allowing_Errors","220281712_Practical_Fast_Searching_in_Strings","2820325_A_Sub-quadratic_Algorithm_for_Approximate_Limited_Expression_Matching","2807301_Fast_Practical_Multi-Pattern_Matching","2784305_A_Fast_Bit-Vector_Algorithm_for_Approximate_String_Matching_Based_on_Dynamic_Programming","2683383_Approximate_Text_Searching","2547979_NR-grep_A_fast_and_flexible_pattern-matching_tool","2375410_A_Guided_Tour_to_Approximate_String_Matching","2329350_A_Partial_Deterministic_Automaton_for_Approximate_String_Matching","2293751_Fast_String_Matching_with_Mismatches"]}
