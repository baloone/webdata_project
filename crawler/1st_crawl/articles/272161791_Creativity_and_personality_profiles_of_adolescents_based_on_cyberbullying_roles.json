{"id":"272161791_Creativity_and_personality_profiles_of_adolescents_based_on_cyberbullying_roles","abstract":"The goal of our pilot study was to describe creative style and Hexaco personality traits of adolescents involved in the cyberbullying phenomenon. We have hypothesized that cyberbullies, victims and cyberbully-victim adolescents have different patterns of creativity style and personality traits. Research data was gathered from N= 138 with ages between 14-18 years. Results revealed that there is a tendency for the most affected subgroup involved in cyberbullying (cyberbully-victims) to present higher levels of creative style. Specific associations between creativity and personality were found when analyzing the profiles of cyberbully roles by gender. Emotionality, Conscientiousness and Honesty were the main personality traits which presented distinct associations with the creative style of male and female students involved in cyberbullying.","authors":["Kinga Szabó","Demeter Kármen","Eniko Batiz","Bota Andrea"],"meta":["December 2014"],"references":[]}
