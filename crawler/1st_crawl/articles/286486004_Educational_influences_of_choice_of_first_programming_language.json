{"id":"286486004_Educational_influences_of_choice_of_first_programming_language","abstract":"The study for degree of Bachelor in Computer science at our Department lasts four years and besides other subjects, offers several interconnected core courses in programming: Introduction to programming, Data structures and algorithms 1 and 2, Operating systems and Compiler construction. The intention in these courses is to put emphasizes on abstract structures and not to insist on particular realization in specific programming language or to use different languages in different courses. In order to avoid teaching many languages and various environments, it was decided to choose one language that is easy to teach and good for development of correct programming style. Chosen language has to be flexible enough to support teaching the different principles, methods and techniques.","authors":["Mirjana Ivanovic","Zoran Budimac","Đura Paunić"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1063/1.4912563","Conference: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS 2014 (ICNAAM-2014)"],"references":["255964908_Using_Flowchart-based_Programming_Environments_for_Simplifying_Programming_and_Software_Engineering_Processes","253318562_Choosing_the_Best_Programming_Language","220613305_Controversy_on_how_to_teach_CS_1_a_discussion_on_the_SIGCSE-members_mailing_list","220613047_A_design-first_curriculum_for_teaching_Java_in_a_CS1_course","300540695_Report_on_The_Programming_Language_Modula-2","260829004_First_Programming_Language_-_Never-ending_Story","240122961_Modula-3_in_an_undergraduate_Computer_Science_course","220807279_Understanding_threads_in_an_advanced_java_course"]}
