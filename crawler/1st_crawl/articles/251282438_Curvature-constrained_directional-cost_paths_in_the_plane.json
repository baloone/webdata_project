{"id":"251282438_Curvature-constrained_directional-cost_paths_in_the_plane","abstract":"This paper looks at the problem of finding the minimum cost curvature-constrained path between two directed points where the\ncost at every point along the path depends on the instantaneous direction. This generalises the results obtained by Dubins\nfor curvature-constrained paths of minimum length, commonly referred to as Dubins paths. We conclude that if the reciprocal\nof the directional-cost function is strictly polarly convex, then the forms of the optimal paths are of the same forms as\nDubins paths. If we relax the strict polar convexity to weak polar convexity, then we show that there exists a Dubins path\nwhich is optimal. The results obtained can be applied to optimising the development of underground mine networks, where the\npaths need to satisfy a curvature constraint and the cost of development of the tunnel depends on the direction due to the\ngeological characteristics of the ground.","authors":["Alan J.
