{"id":"295077288_Causal_Inference_on_Discrete_Data_via_Estimating_Distance_Correlations","abstract":"In this article, we deal with the problem of inferring causal directions when the data are on discrete domain. By considering the distribution of the cause P(X) and the conditional distribution mapping cause to effect P(Y|X) as independent random variables, we propose to infer the causal direction by comparing the distance correlation between P(X) and P(Y|X) with the distance correlation between P(Y) and P(Y|X). We infer that X causes Y if the dependence coefficient between P(X) and P(Y|X) is smaller. Experiments are performed to show the performance of the proposed method.","authors":["Furui Liu","Laiwan Chan"],"meta":["February 2016Neural Computation 28(1):1-14","DOI:10.1162/NECO_a_00820"],"references":["257623131_Replacing_Causal_Faithfulness_with_Algorithmic_Independence_of_Conditionals","254883062_On_causal_discovery_with_cyclic_additive_noise_models","242448131_Causation_Prediction_and_Search","221619551_Nonlinear_causal_discovery_with_additive_noise_models","221404243_Testing_whether_linear_equations_are_causal_A_free_probability_theory_approach","220320721_Kernel_Methods_for_Measuring_Independence","1916952_Measuring_and_Testing_Dependence_by_Correlation_of_Distances","275697437_Causality_Models_Reasoning_and_Inference","271557177_Nonlinear_Causal_Discovery_for_High_Dimensional_Data_A_Kernelized_Trace_Method","268020102_Learning_Linear_Cyclic_Causal_Models_with_Latent_Variables","265830001_Pairwise_Likelihood_Ratios_for_Estimation_of_Non-Gaussian_Structural_Equation_Models","261441734_Causal_Discovery_via_Reproducing_Kernel_Hilbert_Space_Embeddings","239523662_Information-geometric_approach_to_inferring_causal_directions","224174413_Causal_Inference_Using_the_Algorithmic_Markov_Condition","221405014_On_the_Identifiability_of_the_Post-Nonlinear_Causal_Model","220699570_Causality_Discovery_with_Additive_Disturbances_An_Information-Theoretical_Perspective","220320367_A_Linear_Non-Gaussian_Acyclic_Model_for_Causal_Discovery","220320226_Estimation_of_a_Structural_Vector_Autoregression_Model_Using_Non-Gaussianity","50999765_Causal_Inference_on_Discrete_Data_Using_Additive_Noise_Models","48185783_DirectLiNGAM_A_Direct_Method_for_Learning_a_Linear_Non-Gaussian_Structural_Equation_Model"]}
