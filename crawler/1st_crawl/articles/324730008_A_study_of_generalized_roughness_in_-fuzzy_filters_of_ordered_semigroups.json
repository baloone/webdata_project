{"id":"324730008_A_study_of_generalized_roughness_in_-fuzzy_filters_of_ordered_semigroups","abstract":"Concept of generalized rough approximations for fuzzy filters in ordered semigroups is introduced. Then this idea is extended to rough approximations of fuzzy bi-filters and fuzzy quasi-filters in ordered semigroups. -fuzzy filters are a generalization of fuzzy filters and these can be further generalized by -fuzzy filters. Generalized roughness has been studied for both and -fuzzy filters of ordered semigroups.","authors":["Muhammad Irfan Ali","Tahir Mahmood","Azmat Hussain"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Taibah University for Science 12(3):1-10","DOI:10.1080/16583655.2018.1451067"],"references":["265462142_Rough_fuzzy_sets_and_fuzzy_rough_sets","321889578_Generalized_roughness_in_V_q-fuzzy_ideals_of_hemirings","313192493_Fuzzy_topology_I_Neighbourhood_structures_of_a_fuzzy_point_and_Moore-Smith_convergence","264951801_A_note_on_fuzzy_sets_in_semigroups","258045048_Fuzzy_groups","256410233_On_fuzzy_ideals_and_fuzzy_bi-ideals_in_semigroups","243007033_Fuzzy_Groups","242799905_e_e_v_q-fuzzy_subgroup","238237168_Fuzzy_topology_I_Neighborhood_structure_of_a_fuzzy_point_and_Moore-Smith_convergence","229899463_On_q-fuzzy_filters_of_R0-algebras"]}
