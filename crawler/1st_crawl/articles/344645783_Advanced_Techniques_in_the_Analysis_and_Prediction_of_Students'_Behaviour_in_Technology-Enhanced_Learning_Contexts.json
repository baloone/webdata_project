{"id":"344645783_Advanced_Techniques_in_the_Analysis_and_Prediction_of_Students'_Behaviour_in_Technology-Enhanced_Learning_Contexts","abstract":"The development and promotion of teaching-enhanced learning tools in the academic field is leading to the collection of a large amount of data generated from the usual activity of students and teachers. The analysis of these data is an opportunity to improve many aspects of the learning process: recommendations of activities, dropout prediction, performance and knowledge analysis, resources optimization, etc. However, these improvements would not be possible without the application of computer science techniques that have demonstrated a high effectiveness for this purpose: data mining, big data, machine learning, deep learning, collaborative filtering, and recommender systems, among other fields related to intelligent systems. This Special Issue provides 17 papers that show advances in the analysis, prediction, and recommendation of applications propelled by artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning in the teaching-enhanced learning context.","authors":["Juan A.
