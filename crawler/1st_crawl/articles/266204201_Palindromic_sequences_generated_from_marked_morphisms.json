{"id":"266204201_Palindromic_sequences_generated_from_marked_morphisms","abstract":"Fixed points ${\\bf u}=\\varphi({\\bf u})$ of marked and primitive morphisms\n$\\varphi$ over arbitrary alphabet are considered. We show that if ${\\bf u}$ is\npalindromic, i.e., its language contains infinitely many palindromes, then some\npower of $\\varphi$ has a conjugate in class ${\\mathcal P}$. This class was\nintroduced by Hof, Knill, Simon (1995) in order to study palindromic morphic\nwords. Our definitions of marked and well-marked morphisms are more general\nthan the ones previously used by A. Frid (1999) or B. Tan (2007). As any\nmorphism with aperiodic fixed point over binary alphabet is marked, our result\ngeneralizes the result of B. Tan. Labb\\'e (2013) demonstrated that already on a\nternary alphabet the property of morphisms to be marked is important for the\nvalidity of our theorem. The main tool used in our proof is the description of\nbispecial factors in fixed points of morphisms provided by K. Klouda (2012).","authors":["Sébastien Labbé","Edita Pelantova"],"meta":["September 2014European Journal of Combinatorics 51","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2015.05.006","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258224257_On_a_remark_of_Hof_Knill_and_Simon_on_palindromic_substitutive_systems","242744004_Combinatorial_properties_of_f-palindromes_in_the_Thue-Morse_sequence","222679163_Palindrome_complexity","220915842_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","51978654_Bispecial_factors_in_circular_non-pushy_DOL_languages","2618431_Singular_Continuous_Spectrum_for_Palindromic_Schrodinger_Operators","319394668_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","265436996_Algebraic_Combinatorics_on_Words","246546830_A_Counterexample_to_a_Question_of_Hof_Knill_and_Simon","242764616_Palindromic_lacunas_of_the_Thue-Morse_word","226587858_Interval_exchange_transformations","225224998_On_uniform_DOL_words","223125340_Mirror_substitutions_and_palindromic_sequences","220180360_On_The_Palindromic_Complexity_Of_Infinite_Words","220148923_Equations_on_palindromes_and_circular_words","32049484_Proprietes_combinatoires_des_f-palindromes","26645189_Applying_a_uniform_marked_morphism_to_a_word","24164392_Infinite_words_without_palindrome"]}
