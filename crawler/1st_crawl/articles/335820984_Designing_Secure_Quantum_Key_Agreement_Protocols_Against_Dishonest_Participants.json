{"id":"335820984_Designing_Secure_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocols_Against_Dishonest_Participants","abstract":"Quantum key agreement (QKA) aims to negotiate a secure and consistent key among several participants. In this paper, we find that a type of QKA protocol is not secure when a participant is dishonest. He can make the honest participants obtain wrong final keys, which may lead to serious consequences. To resist such attacks, we design a defense strategy by introducing a trusted third party. The theoretical analysis results show that our defense strategy not only can detect the dishonest participantâ€™s attacks, but also can identify who is dishonest. Finally we design an optical platform for participants, and show that both our attack and defense strategies are feasible with current technologies.","authors":["Wei-cong Huang","Yong-kai Yang","Jiang Dong","Chao-hui Gao"],"meta":["December 2019International Journal of Theoretical Physics 58(5)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-019-04275-5"],"references":["329103518_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Based_on_Three-Photon_Entanglement_with_Unidirectional_Qubit_Transmission","329074531_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocol_with_Entanglement_Swapping","328209702_Improving_the_security_of_quantum_key_agreement_protocols_with_single_photon_in_both_polarization_and_spatial-mode_degrees_of_freedom","327560095_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_with_Four-Qubit_Symmetric_W_State","326559274_Multi-party_traveling-mode_quantum_key_agreement_protocols_immune_to_collusive_attack","323861929_Multi-party_quantum_key_agreement_with_five-qubit_brown_states","323524832_Novel_Multi-Party_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocol_with_G-Like_States_and_Bell_States","321177151_Efficient_multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_with_collective_detection","318853352_Improvement_of_Novel_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocol_with_GHZ_States","326387560_Efficient_multi-party_quantum_key_agreement_protocol_based_on_nonorthogonal_quantum_entangled_pairs","315596605_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Based_on_Quantum_Search_Algorithm","315529258_Deterministic_secure_quantum_communication_using_a_single_d-level_system","314193984_Two-party_quantum_key_agreement_with_five-particle_entangled_states","312685318_Experimental_Demonstration_of_Free-Space_Decoy-State_Quantum_Key_Distribution_over_144_km","304618609_Cryptanalysis_of_quantum_secret_sharing_with_d_-level_single_particles"]}
