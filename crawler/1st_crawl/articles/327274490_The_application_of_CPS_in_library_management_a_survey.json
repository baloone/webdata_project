{"id":"327274490_The_application_of_CPS_in_library_management_a_survey","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to present the current state research of cyber-physical system (CPS) and its application in libraries. CPS is a kind of large-scale and networked system that consists of physical and cyber elements and is currently of interest in academia, industry and government. In this survey, the definitions, theoretical foundation and basic applications of CPS are systematically reviewed. In addition, the development of library and current research of CPS application in library management are presented. The vision and challenge of smart library are also discussed.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nBy retrieving the main scholarly databases, the literature of CPS and its application in libraries were examined.\n\nFindings\n\nThis study shows that a lot of CPS technology applications are still in initial stage, and explores CPS potential impacts on libraries.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThe application of CPS in library management has not been paid much attention, this study provides a prospective for the application of CPS in libraries.","authors":["Xueling Liang","Hong Chen"],"meta":["August
