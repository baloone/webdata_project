{"id":"320037488_Formal_Verification_of_Piece-Wise_Linear_Feed-Forward_Neural_Networks","abstract":"We present an approach for the verification of feed-forward neural networks in which all nodes have a piece-wise linear activation function. Such networks are often used in deep learning and have been shown to be hard to verify for modern satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and integer linear programming (ILP) solvers.","authors":["RÃ¼diger Ehlers"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19","Conference: International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis"],"references":["319769813_Fast_and_Accurate_Deep_Network_Learning_by_Exponential_Linear_Units_ELUs","318370372_Safety_Verification_of_Deep_Neural_Networks","313394663_Reluplex_An_Efficient_SMT_Solver_for_Verifying_Deep_Neural_Networks","303486514_Measuring_Neural_Net_Robustness_with_Constraints","300783342_A_Philosophy_for_Developing_Trust_in_Self-driving_Cars","284579051_Fast_and_Accurate_Deep_Network_Learning_by_Exponential_Linear_Units_ELUs","280305180_Sketch-a-Net_that_Beats_Humans","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","239902790_A_History_of_Satisfiability","236943114_Challenging_SMT_solvers_to_verify_neural_networks","221403485_An_Abstraction-Refinement_Approach_to_Verification_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","321595571_Decision_Procedures_An_Algorithmic_Point_of_View","315862776_Accurate_ICP-based_floating-point_reasoning","310746894_Decision_Procedures","300576499_Yices_22","284411763_An_extensible_SAT-solver","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","247931959_The_mnist_database_of_handwritten_digits","221402940_A_fast_linear-arithmetic_solver_for_DPLL_T","220944464_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220669014_Locating_Minimal_Infeasible_Constraint_Sets_in_Linear_Programs"]}
