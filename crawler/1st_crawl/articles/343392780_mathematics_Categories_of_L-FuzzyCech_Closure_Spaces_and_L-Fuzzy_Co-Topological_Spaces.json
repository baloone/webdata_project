{"id":"343392780_mathematics_Categories_of_L-FuzzyCech_Closure_Spaces_and_L-Fuzzy_Co-Topological_Spaces","abstract":"Recently, fuzzy systems have become one of the hottest topics due to their applications in the area of computer science. Therefore, in this article, we are making efforts to add new useful relationships between the selected L-fuzzy (fuzzifying) systems. In particular, we establish relationships between L-fuzzy (fuzzifying) ÄŒech closure spaces, L-fuzzy (fuzzifying) co-topological spaces and L-fuzzy (fuzzifying) approximation spaces based on reflexive L-fuzzy relations. We also show that there is a Galois correspondence between the categories of these spaces.","authors":["Irina Perfilieva","A. A.
