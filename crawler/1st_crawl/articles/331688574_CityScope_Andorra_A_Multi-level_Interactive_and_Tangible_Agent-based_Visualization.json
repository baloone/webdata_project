{"id":"331688574_CityScope_Andorra_A_Multi-level_Interactive_and_Tangible_Agent-based_Visualization","abstract":"This study proposes a novel information visualization approach developed and deployed in the state of Andorra. We present a framework to analyze and represent the flow of people through a multi-level interactive and tangible agent-based visualization. The presented framework, developed to understand Andorra visitor behavior, is embedded in the MIT CityScope framework used for civic engagement, urban development, and decision making.","authors":["Arnaud Grignard","Núria Macià","Luis Alonso","Ariel Noyman"],"meta":["July 2018","Conference: AAMAS 2018,At: July 10-15, 2018, Stockholm, Sweden, 2018","Projects: CityScopeCityScope: A Multi-level Interactive and Tangible Agent-based Visualization"],"references":["319445941_Finding_Places_HCI_Platform_for_Public_Participation_in_Refugees'_Accommodation_Process","259679423_GAMA_16_Advancing_the_Art_of_Complex_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Simulation","303901807_Illuminating_LEGOs_with_Digital_Information_to_Create_Urban_Data_Observatory_and_Intervention_Simulator","266316641_Processing_A_Programming_Handbook_for_Visual_Designers_and_Artists","222820066_Key_Challenges_in_Agent-Based_Modelling_for_Geo-spatial_Simulation"]}
