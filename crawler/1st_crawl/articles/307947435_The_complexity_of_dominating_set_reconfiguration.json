{"id":"307947435_The_complexity_of_dominating_set_reconfiguration","abstract":"Suppose that we are given two dominating sets and of a graph G whose cardinalities are at most a given threshold k. Then, we are asked whether there exists a sequence of dominating sets of G between and such that each dominating set in the sequence is of cardinality at most k and can be obtained from the previous one by either adding or deleting exactly one vertex. This decision problem is known to be PSPACE-complete in general. In this paper, we study the complexity of this problem from the viewpoint of graph classes. We first prove that the problem remains PSPACE-complete even for planar graphs, bounded bandwidth graphs, split graphs, and bipartite graphs. We then give a general scheme to construct linear-time algorithms and show that the problem can be solved in linear time for cographs, forests, and interval graphs. Furthermore, for these tractable cases, we can obtain a desired sequence if it exists such that the number of additions and deletions is bounded by , where n is the number of vertices in the input graph.","authors":["Arash Haddadan","Takehiro Ito","Amer Mouawad","Naomi Nishimura"],"meta":["August 2016Theoretical Computer Science 651","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2016.08.016","Project: Reconfiguration"],"references":["273158401_The_Complexity_of_Dominating_Set_Reconfiguration","269577687_Reconfiguration_of_Cliques_in_a_Graph","263427054_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_Sliding_Tokens_on_Trees","261673053_Shortest_Reconfiguration_Paths_in_the_Solution_Space_of_Boolean_Formulas","260295061_Vertex_Cover_Reconfiguration_and_Beyond","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","257585896_Reconfiguration_graphs_for_vertex_colourings_of_chordal_and_chordal_bipartite_graphs","255731177_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","1959913_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_Computational_and_Structural_Dichotomies","296478516_Reconfiguration_of_Vertex_Covers_in_a_Graph","282989344_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Sliding_Tokens_on_Trees","264005478_The_List_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_for_Bounded_Pathwidth_Graphs","260483018_Reconfiguring_Independent_Sets_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","260107740_Independent_Set_Reconfiguration_in_Cographs","259845447_Reconfiguration_of_Dominating_Sets","257406786_The_k-Dominating_Graph","257145040_Complexity_of_independent_set_reconfigurability_problems","225370913_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","222583694_Dominating_sets_for_split_and_bipartite_graphs","222548494_PSPACE-Completeness_of_Sliding-Block_Puzzles_and_Other_Problems_through_the_Nondeterministic_Constraint_Logic_Model_of_Computation","220975960_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","220152460_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220150975_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Boolean_Connectivity_Problem_for_k-CNF"]}
