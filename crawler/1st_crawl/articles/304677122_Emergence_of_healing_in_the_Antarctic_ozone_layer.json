{"id":"304677122_Emergence_of_healing_in_the_Antarctic_ozone_layer","abstract":"Industrial chlorofluorocarbons that cause ozone depletion have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol. A chemically-driven increase in polar ozone (or “healing”) is expected in response to this historic agreement. Observations and model calculations taken together indicate that the onset of healing of Antarctic ozone loss has now emerged in September. Fingerprints of September healing since 2000 are identified through (i) increases in ozone column amounts, (ii) changes in the vertical profile of ozone concentration, and (iii) decreases in the areal extent of the ozone hole. Along with chemistry, dynamical and temperature changes contribute to the healing, but could represent feedbacks to chemistry. Volcanic eruptions episodically interfere with healing, particularly during 2015 (when a record October ozone hole occurred following the Calbuco eruption).","authors":["Susan Solomon","Diane Ivy","Douglas Kinnison","Michael James Mills"],"meta":["June 2016Science 353(6296)","DOI:10.1126/science.aae0061"],"references":["311508837_Overview_of_IGACSPARC_Chemistry-Climate_Model_Initiative_CCMI_community_simulations_in_support_of_upcoming_ozone_and_climate_assessments","307838738_Nonlinear_response_of_modelled_stratospheric_ozone_to_changes_in_greenhouse_gases_and_ozone_depleting_substances_in_the_recent_past","307727093_A_Match-based_approach_to_the_estimation_of_polar_stratospheric_ozone_loss_using_Aura_Microwave_Limb_Sounder_observations","307697618_Total_ozone_trends_and_variability_during_1979-2012_from_merged_data_sets_of_various_satellites","303385401_Past_changes_in_the_vertical_distribution_of_ozone_-_Part_3_Analysis_and_interpretation_of_trends","295076263_Global_volcanic_aerosol_properties_derived_from_emissions_1990-2014_using_CESM1WACCM","284518274_Radiative_and_Dynamical_Influences_on_Polar_Stratospheric_Temperature_Trends","297735534_Eruption_dynamics_of_the_22-23_April_2015_Calbuco_Volcano_Southern_Chile_Analyses_of_tephra_fall_deposits","282053346_Modified_spontaneous_emission_in_nanophotonic_structures","281707773_Sodium_lidar-observed_gravity_wave_breaking_followed_by_an_upward_propagation_of_sporadic_sodium_layer_over_Hefei_China","278622799_Variability_in_Antarctic_ozone_loss_in_the_last_decade_2004-2013_High-resolution_simulations_compared_to_Aura_MLS_observations","277645752_A_Match-based_approach_to_the_estimation_of_polar_stratospheric_ozone_loss_using_Aura_Microwave_Limb_Sounder_observations","277591580_Nonlinear_response_of_modeled_stratospheric_ozone_to_changes_in_greenhouse_gases_and_ozone_depleting_substances_in_the_recent_past","276485713_Sulfur_dioxide_SO2_from_MIPAS_in_the_upper_troposphere_and_lower_stratosphere_2002-2012","279519405_Simulation_of_Polar_Ozone_Depletion_An_Update"]}
