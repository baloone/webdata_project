{"id":"338600269_Active_and_Emerging_Methodologies_for_Ubiquitous_Education_Potentials_of_Flipped_Learning_and_Gamification","abstract":"Introduction: Nowadays, education is immersed in a process of constant renewal due to the inference of two fundamental facts: The emergence of new technologies and the development of new active methodologies that lead the teaching and learning processes. Methods: A case study was developed to analyze the effects caused in these processes by the implementation of “flipped learning” and “gamification” as teaching models; after the implementation of each one, variables such as learning achievement, learning anxiety, motivation, and autonomy were compared. This work was carried out with secondary school subjects (n = 60) of an educational center of the Autonomous City of Ceuta. A descriptive experimental study was carried out. Gamification and flipped learning effects were compared to analyze both their potentials as educational methodologies. Results: The results show the benefits of both methodologies. All measured dimensions increased positively, in accordance with previous studies on the subject. Conclusion: The implementation of both methodologies in the classroom causes an improvement in the students’ learning processes, in their achievements, and in their enthusiasm.","authors":["Mª Elena Parra Gonzalez","Jesús López-Belmonte","Adrián Segura Robles","Arturo Fuentes Cabrera"],"meta":["January 2020Sustainability 12(2):602","DOI:10.3390/su12020602","Project: Active methodologies in education"],"references":["347975675_Influencia_del_aula_invertida_en_el_rendimiento_academico_Una_revision_sistematica","344944172_Modelo_estructural_de_factores_extrinsecos_influyentes_en_el_flipped_learning","336848980_Impact_of_Educational_Stage_in_the_Application_of_Flipped_Learning_A_Contrasting_Analysis_with_Traditional_Teaching","336141140_Produccion_cientifica_sobre_gamificacion_en_educacion_un_analisis_cienciometrico","335790574_TRADUCCION_Y_VALIDACION_DE_LA_ESCALA_DE_EVALUACION_DE_EXPERIENCIAS_GAMIFICADAS_GAMEX_Translation_and_validation_of_the_Gameful_Experience_Scale_GAMEX","335759866_Creacion_de_contenidos_y_flipped_learning_un_binomio_necesario_para_la_educacion_del_nuevo_milenio","334758441_An_Evaluation_of_Content_Creation_for_Personalised_Learning_Using_Digital_ICT_Literacy_Module_among_Aboriginal_Students_mLICT-OA","334467302_Projection_of_the_Flipped_Learning_Methodology_in_the_Teaching_Staff_of_Cross-Border_Contexts","333921763_El_efecto_de_las_TIC_y_redes_sociales_en_estudiantes_universitarios","333107792_Ensenanza_artistica_mediante_TIC_en_la_Educacion_Secundaria_Obligatoria"]}
