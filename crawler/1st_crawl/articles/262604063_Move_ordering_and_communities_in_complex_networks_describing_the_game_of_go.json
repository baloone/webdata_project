{"id":"262604063_Move_ordering_and_communities_in_complex_networks_describing_the_game_of_go","abstract":"We analyze the game of go from the point of view of complex networks. We\nconstruct three different directed networks of increasing complexity, defining\nnodes as local patterns on plaquettes of increasing sizes, and links as actual\nsuccessions of these patterns in databases of real games. We discuss the\npeculiarities of these networks compared to other types of networks. We explore\nthe ranking vectors and community structure of the networks and show that this\napproach enables to extract groups of moves with common strategic properties.\nWe also investigate different networks built from games with players of\ndifferent levels or from different phases of the game. We discuss how the study\nof the community structure of these networks may help to improve the computer\nsimulations of the game. More generally, we believe such studies may help to\nimprove the understanding of human decision process.","authors":["Vivek Kandiah","B.
