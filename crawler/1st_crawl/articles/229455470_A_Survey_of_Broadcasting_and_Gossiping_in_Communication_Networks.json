{"id":"229455470_A_Survey_of_Broadcasting_and_Gossiping_in_Communication_Networks","abstract":"Gossiping and broadcasting are two problems of information dissemination described for a group of individuals connected by a communication network. In gossiping every person in the network knows a unique item of information and needs to communicate it to everyone else. In broadcasting one individual has an item of information which needs to be communicated to everyone else. We review the results that have been obtained on these and related problems.","authors":["Sandra M. Hedetniemi","Stephen T. Hedetniemi","Arthur L.
