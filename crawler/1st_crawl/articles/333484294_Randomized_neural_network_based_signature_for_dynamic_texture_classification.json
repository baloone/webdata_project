{"id":"333484294_Randomized_neural_network_based_signature_for_dynamic_texture_classification","abstract":"Dynamic texture analysis has been the focus of intensive research in recent years. Thus, this paper presents an innovative and highly discriminative dynamic texture analysis method, whose signature is composed of the weights of the output layer of a randomized neural network after a training procedure. This training is performed by using the pixels of slices of each orthogonal plane of the video (XY, YT, and XT) as input feature vectors and corresponding output labels. The obtained video signature provided an accuracy of 97.05%, 98.54%, 97.74% and 96.51% on the UCLA-50 classes, UCLA-9 classes, UCLA-8 classes and Dyntex++, respectively. These results, when compared to other dynamic texture analysis methods, demonstrate that our descriptors are very effective and that our proposed approach can contribute significantly to the field of dynamic texture analysis.","authors":["Jarbas Joaci de Mesquita SÃ¡ Junior","Lucas C Ribas","Odemir Martinez Bruno"],"meta":["May 2019Expert Systems with Applications 135(8)","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2019.05.055"],"references":["315116628_Convolutional_Neural_Network_on_Three_Orthogonal_Planes_for_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","272392118_A_complex_network_approach_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","222614245_DynTex_A_comprehensive_database_of_dynamic_textures","221304045_Maximum_Margin_Distance_Learning_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","221258929_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Normal_Flow_and_Texture_Regularity","221112012_Dynamic_texture_classification_using_dynamic_fractal_analysis","220659398_Dynamic_Textures","220420979_Random_Number_Generators_Good_Ones_Are_Hard_to_Find","51990056_Spatiotemporal_Gabor_filters_a_new_method_for_dynamic_texturerecognition","29602920_A_Comparison_of_Wavelet_Based_Spatio-temporal_Decomposition_Methods_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","5483792_Modeling_Clustering_and_Segmenting_Video_with_Mixtures_of_Dynamic_Textures","4260067_Classifying_Video_with_Kernel_Dynamic_Textures","4171786_Classification_and_retrieval_of_traffic_video_using_auto-regressive_stochastic_processes","3765120_Feature_extraction_of_temporal_texture_based_on_spatiotemporal_motion_trajectory","347253096_Randomized_neural_networks_for_preference_learning_with_physiological_data","342232632_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Theory_and_Applications","330706793_An_unsupervised_parameter_learning_model_for_RVFL_neural_network","320413431_A_Method_of_Generating_Random_Weights_and_Biases_in_Feedforward_Neural_Networks_with_Random_Hidden_Nodes","319292077_A_Randomized_Neural_Network_for_Data_Streams","315890929_Parsimonious_Random_Vector_Functional_Link_Network_for_Data_Streams","310735568_Dynamic_texture_recognition_using_multiresolution_edge-weighted_local_structure_pattern","301761593_A_novel_scheme_based_on_local_binary_pattern_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","291771685_Analysis_of_crowded_scenes_using_holistic_properties","282452682_ELM_based_signature_for_texture_classification","282407735_A_Comprehensive_Evaluation_of_Random_Vector_Functional_Link_Networks","281781675_Dynamic_texture_recognition_by_aggregating_spatial_and_temporal_features_via_ensemble_SVMs","273529088_Chaotic_features_for_dynamic_textures_recognition","273528138_Dynamic_texture_recognition_based_on_completed_volume_local_binary_pattern","273393002_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Multiscale_Binarized_Statistical_Image_Features","273308875_Spatiotemporal_Directional_Number_Transitional_Graph_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","272102392_Exploiting_high_level_feature_for_dynamic_textures_recognition","270006059_Hidden_Markov_Model_Based_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","257484937_Dynamic_texture_segmentation_based_on_deterministic_partially_self-avoiding_walks","257484783_Scale-space_texture_description_on_SIFT-like_textons","257404893_Dynamic_texture_analysis_and_segmentation_using_deterministic_partially_self-Avoiding_walks","256822563_Combining_fractal_and_deterministic_walkers_for_texture_analysis_and_classification","253077043_Thrombus_segmentation_by_texture_dynamics_from_microscopic_image_sequences","242326157_Mathematical_Methods_in_Large-Scale_Computing_Units","239064079_Solution_of_Ill-Posed_Problems_and_the_regularization_method","235267470_On_the_Reciprocal_of_the_General_Algebraic_Matrix","230713633_Wavelet_Domain_Multifractal_Analysis_for_Static_and_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","230649882_A_Generalized_Inverse_for_Matrices","224218368_Classification_of_traffic_video_based_on_a_spatiotemporal_orientation_analysis","222806716_Learning_and_generalization_characteristics_of_the_random_vector_Functional-link_net","222649467_Tikhonov_regularization_and_the_L-curve_for_large_discrete_ill-posed_problems","221361369_View-Invariant_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_using_a_Bag_of_Dynamical_Systems","221259449_Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_a_Dynamic_Texture_Based_Method","48304609_Temporal_Texture_and_Activity_Recognition","6397809_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Local_Binary_Patterns_with_an_Application_to_Facial_Expressions","4263298_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Optical_Flow_Features_and_Temporal_Periodicity","3603890_WEKA_A_machine_learning_workbench","3513884_Feedforward_neural_networks_with_random_weights","2954112_Functional-Link_Net_Computing_Theory_System_Architecture_and_Functionalities","2377941_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition"]}
