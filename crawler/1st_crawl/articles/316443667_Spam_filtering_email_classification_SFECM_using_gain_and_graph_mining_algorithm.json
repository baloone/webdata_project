{"id":"316443667_Spam_filtering_email_classification_SFECM_using_gain_and_graph_mining_algorithm","abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid solution of spam email classifier using context based email classification model as main algorithm complimented by information gain calculation to increase spam classification accuracy. Proposed solution consists of three stages email pre-processing, feature extraction and email classification. Research has found that LingerIG spam filter is highly effective at separating spam emails from cluster of homogenous work emails. Also experiment result proved the accuracy of spam filtering is 100% as recorded by the team of developers at University of Sydney. The study has shown that implementing the spam filter in the context -based email classification model is feasible. Experiment of the study has confirmed that spam filtering aspect of context-based classification model can be improved.","authors":["M. K.
