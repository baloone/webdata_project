{"id":"281808671_Improved_Strength_Four_Covering_Arrays_with_Three_Symbols","abstract":"A covering array $t$-$CA(n,k,g)$, of size $n$, strength $t$, degree $k$, and\norder $g$, is a $k\\times n$ array on $g$ symbols such that every $t\\times n$\nsub-array contains every $t\\times 1$ column on $g$ symbols at least once.\nCovering arrays have been studied for their applications to software testing,\nhardware testing, drug screening, and in areas where interactions of multiple\nparameters are to be tested. In this paper, we present an algebraic\nconstruction that improves many of the best known upper bounds on $n$ for\ncovering arrays 4-$CA(n,k,g)$ with $g=3$. The {\\it coverage measure} $\\mu_t(A)$\nof a testing array $A$ is defined by the ratio between the number of distinct\n$t$-tuples contained in the column vectors of $A$ and the total number of\n$t$-tuples. A covering array is a testing array with full coverage. The {\\it\ncovering arrays with budget constraints problem} is the problem of constructing\na testing array of size at most $n$ having largest possible coverage measure,\ngiven values of $k,g$ and $n$. This paper presents several strength four\ntesting arrays with high coverage. The construction here is a generalisation of\nthe construction methods used by Chateauneuf, Colbourn, Kreher, Meagher and\nStevens.","authors":["Soumen Maity","Yasmeen Akhtar","Reshma Chandrasekharan","Charles J.
