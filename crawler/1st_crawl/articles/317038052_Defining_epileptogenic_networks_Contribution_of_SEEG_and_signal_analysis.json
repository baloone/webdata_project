{"id":"317038052_Defining_epileptogenic_networks_Contribution_of_SEEG_and_signal_analysis","abstract":"Epileptogenic networks are defined by the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. In this review we describe the historical, methodologic, and conceptual bases of this model in the analysis of electrophysiologic intracerebral recordings. In the context of epilepsy surgery, the determination of cerebral regions producing seizures (i.e., the “epileptogenic zone”) is a crucial objec- tive. In contrast with a traditional focal vision of focal drug-resistant epilepsies, the concept of epileptogenic networks has been progressively introduced as a model bet- ter able to describe the complexity of seizure dynamics and realistically describe the distribution of epileptogenic anomalies in the brain. The concept of epileptogenic networks is historically linked to the development of the stereoelectroencephalogra- phy (SEEG) method and subsequent introduction of means of quantifying the recorded signals. Seizures, and preictal and interictal discharges produce clear pat- terns on SEEG. These patterns can be analyzed utilizing signal analysis methods that quantify high-frequency oscillations or changes in functional connectivity. Dramatic changes in SEEG brain connectivity can be described during seizure genesis and prop- agation within cortical and subcortical regions, associated with the production of dif- ferent patterns of seizure semiology. The interictal state is characterized by networks generating abnormal activities (interictal spikes) and also by modified func- tional properties. The introduction of novel approaches to large-scale modeling of these networks offers new methods in the goal of better predicting the effects of epi- lepsy surgery. The epileptogenic network concept is a key factor in identifying the anatomic distribution of the epileptogenic process, which is particularly important in the context of epilepsy surgery.","authors":["Fabrice Bartolomei","Stanislas Lagarde","Fabrice Wendling","Aileen Mcgonigal"],"meta":["May 2017Epilepsia 58(Suppl 2):1-17","DOI:10.1111/epi.13791","Project: Epileptic networks"],"references":["315806219_Individual_brain_structure_and_modelling_predict_seizure_propagation","306258224_Identification_of_Interictal_Epileptic_Networks_from_Dense-EEG","305746323_The_Virtual_Epileptic_Patient_Individualized_whole-brain_models_of_epilepsy_spread","305267767_Seizure-onset_patterns_in_focal_cortical_dysplasia_and_neurodevelopmental_tumors_Relationship_with_surgical_prognosis_and_neuropathologic_subtypes","309705525_Localization_of_Epileptogenic_Zone_Based_on_Graph_Analysis_of_Stereo-EEG","308728225_Diagnostic_utility_of_invasive_EEG_for_epilepsy_surgery_Indications_modalities_and_techniques","305817368_Pre-seizure_architecture_of_the_local_connections_of_the_epileptic_focus_examined_via_graph-theory","305723310_How_does_vagal_nerve_stimulation_VNS_change_EEG_brain_functional_connectivity","305719669_Occipital_and_occipital_plus_epilepsies_A_study_of_involved_epileptogenic_networks_through_SEEG_quantification","304745778_The_role_of_sub-hippocampal_versus_hippocampal_regions_in_bitemporal_lobe_epilepsies","301796050_Graph_Measures_of_Node_Strength_for_Characterizing_Preictal_Synchrony_in_Partial_Epilepsy","286985375_Predicting_Surgery_Targets_in_Temporal_Lobe_Epilepsy_through_Structural_Connectome_Based_Simulations","301818011_Individual_structural_connectivity_defines_propagation_networks_in_partial_epilepsy","295541267_Is_SEEG_safe_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis_of_stereo-electroencephalography-related_complications","295076899_Altered_directed_functional_connectivity_in_temporal_lobe_epilepsy_in_the_absence_of_interictal_spikes_A_high_density_EEG_study"]}
