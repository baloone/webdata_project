{"id":"322568421_TernausNet_U-Net_with_VGG11_Encoder_Pre-Trained_on_ImageNet_for_Image_Segmentation","abstract":"Pixel-wise image segmentation is demanding task in computer vision. Classical U-Net architectures composed of encoders and decoders are very popular for segmentation of medical images, satellite images etc. Typically, neural network initialized with weights from a network pre-trained on a large data set like ImageNet shows better performance than those trained from scratch on a small dataset. In some practical applications, particularly in medicine and traffic safety, the accuracy of the models is of utmost importance. In this paper, we demonstrate how the U-Net type architecture can be improved by the use of the pre-trained encoder. Our code and corresponding pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ternaus/TernausNet. We compare three weight initialization schemes: LeCun uniform, the encoder with weights from VGG11 and full network trained on the Carvana dataset. This network architecture was a part of the winning solution (1st out of 735) in the Kaggle: Carvana Image Masking Challenge.","authors":["Vladimir Iglovikov","Alexey Shvets"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":["319895429_Multi-Task_Learning_for_Segmentation_of_Building_Footprints_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","317350688_Opportunities_And_Obstacles_For_Deep_Learning_In_Biology_And_Medicine","277411157_Deep_Learning","321785628_Can_semantic_labeling_methods_generalize_to_any_city_the_inria_aerial_image_labeling_benchmark","317710664_Satellite_Imagery_Feature_Detection_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_A_Kaggle_Competition","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","269375158_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_Challenge_A_Retrospective","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition"]}
