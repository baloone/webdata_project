{"id":"322609308_Audience_Based_View_of_Publication_Impact","abstract":"With increasing pressure to demonstrate a return on investment, scientific user facilities and government funded research projects must strive to demonstrate positive impact of their research on others. Historically, citation counts and journal impact factor have been widely used as a single quantitative measure of impact. However, with the expansion of various modes of communication, citation counts no longer hold as much merit as a single measure of impact. This work seeks to expand on citation counts by considering the audience to which a publication draws attention. Based on communication mode, there are various audiences that may be \"impacted\" but those audiences are not fully captured by citation count. Consequently, we propose that impact measures for publications should be oriented around the audience with quantifiable measures based on the various communication modes.","authors":["Robert Patton","Drahomira Herrmannova","Christopher Stahl","Jack C Wells"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1145/3127526.3127538","Conference: the 6th International Workshop"],"references":["310661933_US_daily_temperature_records_past_present_and_future","309919389_Science_Periodicals_in_the_Nineteenth_and_Twenty-First_Centuries","283975603_Impact_of_solar_panels_on_global_climate","273956760_Life_cycle_air_quality_impacts_of_conventional_and_alternative_light-duty_transportation_in_the_United_States","268444343_Relationship_between_altmetric_and_bibliometric_indicators_across_academic_social_sites_The_case_of_CSIC's_members","267456008_Do_altmetrics_point_to_the_broader_impact_of_research_An_overview_of_benefits_and_disadvantages_of_altmetrics","235357876_Intrinsic_Electrical_Transport_Properties_of_Monolayer_Silicene_and_MoS2from_First_Principles","233865853_Axisymmetric_Ab_Initio_Core-Collapse_Supernova_Simulations_of_12-25_M_sol_Stars","227349395_In_Defence_of_the_Linear_Model_An_Essay","225836655_Is_citation_analysis_a_legitimate_evaluation_tool","224053363_Covalently_bonded_three-dimensional_carbon_nanotube_solids_via_boron_induced_nanojunctions","51824206_Quantifying_the_Impact_and_Relevance_of_Scientific_Research","310659983_Transcript_protein_and_metabolite_temporal_dynamics_in_the_CAM_plant_Agave","283543545_Recent_Advances_in_Two-Dimensional_Materials_Beyond_Graphene","281389807_The_Linear_Model_of_Innovation_The_Historical_Construction_of_an_Analytical_Framework_Science","279968736_A_review_of_the_literature_on_citation_impact_indicators","273188794_The_Effect_of_the_TseTse_Fly_on_African_Development","260282747_Altmetrics_A_Manifesto","257248467_Electronic_Structural_Moire_Pattern_Effects_on_MoS2MoSe2_2D_Heterostructures","256858128_Hydrogen_adsorption_absorption_and_diffusion_on_and_in_transition_metal_surfaces_A_DFT_study","228379873_The_Linear_Model_of_Innovation","226719979_Is_Citation_Analysis_a_Legitimate_Evaluation_Tool","220433841_Problems_of_Citation_Analysis_A_Critical_Review","37716385_PasteurS_Quadrant_Basic_Science_and_Technological_Innovation"]}
