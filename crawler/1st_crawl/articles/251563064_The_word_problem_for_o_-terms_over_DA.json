{"id":"251563064_The_word_problem_for_o_-terms_over_DA","abstract":"In this paper, we solve the word problem for ω-terms over DA. We extend to DA the ideas used by Almeida and Zeitoun to solve the analogous problem for the pseudovariety R applying also a representation by automata of implicit operations on DA, which was recently obtained by the author. Considering certain types of factors of an implicit operation on DA, we can prove that a pseudoword on DA is an ω-term if and only if the associated minimal DA-automaton is finite. Finally, we complete the result by effectively computing in polynomial time the minimal DA-automaton associated to an ω-term.","authors":["Ana Moura"],"meta":["October 2011Theoretical Computer Science 412(46):6556-6569","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2011.08.003"],"references":["265889081_Normal_forms_for_free_aperiodic_semigroups","228746959_The_equational_theory_of_o-terms_for_finite_R-trivial_semigroups","283926055_Diamonds_are_forever_The_variety_DA","268492136_Finite_Semigroups_and_Universal_Algebra","246194182_Finite_semigroups_an_introduction_to_a_unified_theory_of_pseudovarieties","245099136_A_syntactical_proof_of_locality_of_DA","242415832_An_algorithm_for_testing_the_equivalence_of_finite_automata","242398971_Algorithm_for_minimizing_the_states_in_a_finite_automaton","239041872_Canonical_regular_expressions_and_minimal_state_graphs_for_definite_events","235208212_An_N_Log_N_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_States_in_a_Finite_Automaton","222575456_An_automata-theoretic_approach_to_the_word_problem_for_o_-terms_over_R","222551535_Description_and_analysis_of_a_bottom-up_DFA_minimization_algorithm","220169694_Representations_of_the_Free_Profinite_Object_over_da","2524950_Diamonds_Are_Forever_The_Variety_DA"]}
