{"id":"234642178_Personalizing_Math_Word_Problems","abstract":"The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of three levels of personalization--individual, group, and non-personalized--on the achievement of seventh grade Hispanic boys and girls on mathematics word problems. Subjects were 123 seventh grade Hispanic students from a rural junior high school near Phoenix, Arizona. A pretest was employed to control for potential initial achievement differences by treatment or sex. Subjects were blocked by sex on the basis of their pretest scores, then randomly assigned within each block to the three treatments. A biographical inventory was administered three weeks prior to the administration of treatments to collect, in addition to biographical data, information regarding favorite objects, places, persons, and events for use in personalizing the word problems. The three treatments were administered during regularly scheduled math classes. Achievement was measured the following day using a 16-item constructed response posttest immediately after completion of the review material. An attitude scale was administered to measure the student's level of interest in the lesson and perceived level of difficulty, perception of the importance of the lesson, the level of importance attached to seeing one's name in print, preference for personalized or non-personalized problems, and preference for word or number problems. Analyses of the data indicate that personalization had a significant effect on student achievement on two-step problems, and that there was no significant difference in the overall performance of males and females. Attitude data generally favored individualized personalization over the other two treatments. (29 references) (GL)","authors":["Cecilia L. Lopez"],"meta":["January 1990"],"references":[]}
