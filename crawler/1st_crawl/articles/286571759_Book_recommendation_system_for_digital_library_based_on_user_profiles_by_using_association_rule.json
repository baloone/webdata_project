On one hand, people have a large number of information resources. On the other hand, the time cost and difficulty of people finding the proper information increases. To tackle the problems, book recommendation is one of the solutions for university libraries which possess huge volumes of books and reading-intensive users. This paper proposes a library book recommendation system based on user profile loaning and apply association rule to create model. The result shows that new association rule algorithm suitable to apply for recommender book in library.","authors":["Pijitra Jomsri"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1109/INTECH.2014.6927766","Conference: 2014 Fourth International Conference on Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH)"],"references":["220907269_Personalized_Knowledge_Discovery_Mining_Novel_Association_Rules_from_Text","220835452_Case_Studies_in_Association_Rule_Mining_for_Recommender_Systems","220451885_Efficient_Adaptive-Support_Association_Rule_Mining_for_Recommender_Systems","3297245_Probabilistic_Memory-Based_Collaborative_Filtering","2373470_Effective_Personalization_Based_on_Association_Rule_Discovery_from_Web_Usage_Data","299679471_Research_of_Library_Book_Recommendation_System_Based_on_Cloud_Computing","221900765_Fast_Algorithms_for_Mining_Association_Rules_in_Large_Databases","221509159_Users'_Book-Loan_Behaviors_Analysis_and_Knowledge_Dependency_Mining","36410665_Mining_Association_Rules_in_Folksonomies","4286043_Book_Recommendation_Service_by_Improved_Association_Rule_Mining_Algorithm","2582269_A_Framework_for_Collaborative_Content-Based_and_Demographic_Filtering","1961316_Content-Based_Book_Recommending_Using_Learning_for_Text_Categorization"]}
