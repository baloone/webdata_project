{"id":"278734341_Several_new_classes_of_Boolean_functions_with_few_Walsh_transform_values","abstract":"In this paper, several new classes of Boolean functions with few Walsh\ntransform values, including bent, semi-bent and five-valued functions, are\nobtained by adding the product of two or three linear functions to some known\nbent functions.Numerical results show that the proposed class contains cubic\nbent functions that are affinely inequivalent to all known quadratic ones.\nMeanwhile, we determine the distribution of the Walsh spectrum of five-valued\nfunctions constructed in this paper.","authors":["Guangkui Xu","Xiwang Cao","Shanding Xu"],"meta":["March 2017Applicable Algebra in Engineering Communication and Computing 28(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00200-016-0298-3","SourcearXiv","Project: NSFC 11371011"],"references":["271918852_Some_semi-bent_functions_with_polynomial_trace_form","260542478_Several_New_Classes_of_Bent_Functions_From_Dillon_Exponents","289626573_Construction_of_Semi-Bent_Boolean_Functions_in_Even_Number_of_Variables","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","265334005_Elementary_Hadamard_difference_sets","263094119_Several_New_Infinite_Families_of_Bent_Functions_and_Their_Duals","261565873_The_compositional_inverse_of_a_class_of_linearized_permutation_polynomials_over_F_2_n_N_odd","260576544_Hyperbent_Functions_via_Dillon-Like_Exponents","260542428_A_Class_of_Binomial_Bent_Functions_Over_the_Finite_Fields_of_Odd_Characteristic","260302508_Further_Results_on_Niho_Bent_Functions","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","256391988_On_bent_functions","256199624_Special_Bent_and_Near-bent_Functions","254057278_On_Semibent_Boolean_Functions","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes"]}
