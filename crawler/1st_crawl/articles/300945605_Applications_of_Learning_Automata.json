{"id":"300945605_Applications_of_Learning_Automata","abstract":"This chapter discusses the applications of learning automata. The applications of learning automata cover a wide range of problems such as absorption columns, bioreactors, communication, computers, drying furnaces, fluidized bed reactors, image processing, irrigation canals, and liquidâ€“liquid extraction columns. Learning automata should, by collecting and processing current information regarding the environment, be capable of changing their structure and parameters as time evolves to achieve the desired goal or the optimal performance in some sense. Learning systems have made a significant impact on all areas of engineering problems arising from complexity and uncertainty. They are attractive methods for solving process control, optimization, pattern recognition, image processing, telecommunications, and scheduling. They are very simple to implement and need little prior knowledge. The only calculation required for the implementation of learning system is the relatively simple adjustment of the state probability distribution. In the control context, it is not necessary to construct a model for the process to be controlled. The number of learning systems applications has increased with the advent of highly integrated computers that made the technology cost-effective.","authors":["Kaddour Najim","Alexander S.
