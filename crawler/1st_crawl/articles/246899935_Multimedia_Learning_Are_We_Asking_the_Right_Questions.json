{"id":"246899935_Multimedia_Learning_Are_We_Asking_the_Right_Questions","abstract":"How can we help students to understand scientific explanations of cause-and-effect systems, such as how a pump works, how the human respiratory system works, or how lightning storms develop? One promising approach involves multimedia presentation of explanations in visual and verbal formats, such as presenting computer-generated animations synchronized with computer-generated narration or presenting illustrations next to corresponding text. In a review of eight studies concerning whether multimedia instruction is effective, there was consistent evidence for a multimedia effect: Students who received coordinated presentation of explanations in verbal and visual format (multiple representation group) generated a median of over 75% more creative solutions on problem-solving transfer tests than did students who received verbal explanations alone (single representation group). In a review of 10 studies; concerning when multimedia instruction is effective, there was consistent evidence for a contiguity effect: Students generated a median of over 50% more creative solutions to transfer problems when verbal and visual explanations were coordinated (integrated group) than when they were not coordinated (separated group). Finally, in a review of six studies concerning for whom multimedia instruction is effective, Attribute x Treatment interactions indicated that multimedia and contiguity effects were strongest for low prior knowledge and high spatial ability students. Results are consistent with a generative theory of multimedia learning in which learners actively select, organize, and integrate verbal and visual information.","authors":["Richard Mayer"],"meta":["June 2010Educational Psychologist 32(1)","DOI:10.1207/s15326985ep3201_1"],"references":["247357883_Reconsidering_Research_on_Learning_from_Media","239724523_Examining_the_Effects_of_Different_Multiple_Representational_Systems_in_Learning_Primary_Mathematics","233663424_Can_a_computer_interface_support_self-explaining","232585988_The_Instructive_Animation_Helping_Students_Build_Connections_Between_Words_and_Pictures_in_Multimedia_Learning","232551554_Systematic_Thinking_Fostered_by_Illustrations_in_Scientific_Text","232530555_Cognitive_Constraints_on_Multimedia_Learning_When_Presenting_More_Material_Results_in_Less_Understanding","232454397_Animations_Need_Narrations_An_Experimental_Test_of_a_Dual-Coding_Hypothesis","232452390_When_Is_an_Illustration_Worth_Ten_Thousand_Words","228611663_For_Whom_Is_a_Picture_Worth_a_Thousand_Words_Extensions_of_a_Dual-Coding_Theory_of_Multimedia_Learning","225249172_Dual_Coding_Theory_and_Education","225167506_Media_will_never_influence_learning","222420975_Construction_and_interference_in_learning_from_multiple_representation","222287029_Representation_construction_externalised_cognition_and_individual_differences","220637620_Learning_to_Think_and_Communicate_with_Diagrams_14_Questions_to_Consider","48828982_Cognitive_Load_Theory_and_the_Format_of_Instruction","46418922_Learner_Articulation_as_Interactional_Achievement_Studying_the_Conversation_of_Gesture","44525566_Knowledge_Acquisition_from_Text_and_Pictures","321565487_The_Psychology_of_Illustration_Volume_2_Instructional_Issues","313552659_Situations_mental_models_and_generative_knowledge","280895089_Animations_Need_Narrations_An_Experimental_Test_of_a_Dual-Coding_Hypothesis","280808621_When_Is_an_Illustration_Worth_Ten_Thousand_Words","259343772_Working_memory_WM","256636808_Introduction","249797483_Models_for_Understanding","248114078_Learning_with_media_Restructuring_the_debate","247520546_Similarity_and_Analogical_Reasoning","246665271_Learning_as_a_generative_activity","246304314_Generative_Learning_Processes_of_Comprehension","242447656_Aids_to_Text_Comprehension","242374656_Beyond_io_a_tfiarchie_theory_of_human_intelligence","242359724_Instructional_Effectiveness_of_Video_Media","238750552_Objectivism_versus_constructivism_do_we_need_a_new_philosophical_paradigm_educational_technology_research_development","233046669_Learning_as_a_generative_process_1","232577766_Analogies_as_an_Aid_to_Understanding_and_Memory","232569137_Some_remarks_on_the_commentary_On_the_relation_of_dual_coding_and_mental_models_in_graphics_comprehension","232503583_Relationship_between_what_is_remembered_and_creative_problem_solving_in_science_learning","227060377_A_generative_theory_of_textbook_design_Using_annotated_illustrations_to_foster_meaningful_learning_of_science_text","226021384_Objectivism_versus_constructivism_Do_we_need_a_new_philosophical_paradigm","225931905_A_reply_Media_and_methods","225818987_Instructional_control_of_cognitive_load_in_the_training_of_complex_cognitive_tasks","225716985_Will_media_influence_learning_Reframing_the_debate","225550845_Animation_in_Computer-Based_Instruction","225130872_Delivery_trucks_or_groceries_More_food_for_thought_on_whether_media_will_may_can't_influence_learning","222801038_Comprehension_of_graphics_in_texts_An_overview","222533794_The_Promise_of_Multimedia_Learning_Using_the_Same_Instructional_Design_Methods_across_Different_Media","222299263_Aids_to_computer-based_multimedia_learning_Learn_Instruct_12_107-119","200772734_Mental_Representations_A_Dual_Coding_Approach","48828989_Cognitive_Load_as_a_Factor_in_the_Structuring_of_Technical_Material","44361449_Interaction_of_media_cognition_and_learning_Gabriel_Salomon","36355686_The_Nature_of_Explanation","2373503_Toward_Computer-Based_Support_of_Meta-Cognitive_Skills_a_Computational_Framework_to_Coach_Self-Explanation"]}
