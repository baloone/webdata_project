{"id":"342211718_A_Summary_of_Inclusive_Pedagogies_for_Science_Education","abstract":"In this paper, we offer a brief review of six pedagogical and theoretical approaches used in education and science education that we grouped as inclusive pedagogies. Though not an exhaustive list, these pedagogies are more commonly used in educational research and have commonalities yet are distinctive in some ways. They collectively contribute to making science teaching and learning more inclusive to a broader population of learners, such as students from diverse cultural, linguistic, and social backgrounds and students with physical and learning differences who have traditionally been marginalized in learning science. Furthermore, these inclusive pedagogies aim to decrease educational inequities and raise the level of academic rigor and access for all students. Finally, we discuss ways these inclusive pedagogies can be extended to address reform efforts in science education.","authors":["Felicia Moore Mensah","Kristen Larson"],"meta":["December 2017","Project: Culturally Relevant Teaching"],"references":["315827228_The_Three-Story_Challenge_Implications_of_the_Next_Generation_Science_Standards_for_Teacher_Preparation","311956716_High_school_biology_evolution_learning_experiences_in_a_rural_context_a_case_of_and_for_cultural_border_crossing","306297556_Applying_funds_of_knowledge_theory_in_a_New_Zealand_high_school_New_directions_for_pedagogical_practice","320059717_Justice-centered_science_pedagogy_A_catalyst_for_academic_achievement_and_social_transformation","318145389_A_metasynthesis_of_the_complementarity_of_culturally_responsive_and_inquiry-based_science_education_in_K-12_settings_Implications_for_advancing_equitable_science_teaching_and_learning_CRP_AND_INQUIRY-","317953643_Toward_a_Theory_of_Culturally_Relevant_Pedagogy","306924395_The_Knowledge_and_Practices_of_High_School_Science_Teachers_in_Pursuit_of_Cultural_Responsiveness_KNOWLEDGE_AND_PRACTICES_IN_PURSUIT_OF_CRP","301251352_Latinao_Adolescents'_Funds_of_Knowledge_Related_to_Engineering","298433978_Beyond_the_English_Learner_Frame_Transnational_Funds_of_Knowledge_in_Social_Studies","289785810_The_Irregular_School_Exclusion_Schooling_and_Inclusive_Education"]}
