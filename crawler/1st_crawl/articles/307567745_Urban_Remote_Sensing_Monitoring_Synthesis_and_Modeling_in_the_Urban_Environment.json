{"id":"307567745_Urban_Remote_Sensing_Monitoring_Synthesis_and_Modeling_in_the_Urban_Environment","abstract":"Urban Remote Sensing is designed for upper level undergraduates, graduates, researchers and practitioners, and has a clear focus on the development of remote sensing technology for monitoring, synthesis and modeling in the urban environment. It covers four major areas: the use of high-resolution satellite imagery or alternative sources of image date (such as high-resolution SAR and LIDAR) for urban feature extraction; the development of improved image processing algorithms and techniques for deriving accurate and consistent information on urban attributes from remote sensor data; the development of analytical techniques and methods for deriving indicators of socioeconomic and environmental conditions that prevail within urban landscape; and the development of remote sensing and spatial analytical techniques for urban growth simulation and predictive modeling.","authors":["X.
