{"id":"264820961_A_comprehensive_training_model_of_the_teamwork_competence","abstract":"The teamwork competence is one of the most demanded competences by the social environment and, therefore, is already a part of the learning objectives in the university studies. A comprehensive training model of the framework competence is presented on this paper which includes a description of this operational competence, within the training field, and the keys to design the training plan by using the ICT. Finally, a multidimensional empirical study of the students' experience in teamwork is presented, including the pre and post-implementation of a training prototype of this competence that was tested at the Technical University of Madrid and the University of Zaragoza in the 2012 spring term.","authors":["Dolores Lerís","Ángel Fidalgo Blanco","María Luisa Sein-Echaluce"],"meta":["January 2014International Journal of Learning and Intellectual Capital 11(1):1 - 19","DOI:10.1504/IJLIC.2014.059216"],"references":["265074523_The_Mathematical_Communication_Competency_in_the_Engineering_Degrees_a_Tool_to_Assess_the_Starting_Point","235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","220041231_Team_Effectiveness_1997-2007_A_Review_of_Recent_Advancements_and_a_Glimpse_Into_the_Future","285151839_The_ALL_Teamwork_Framework","271896413_The_knowledge_skill_and_ability_requirements_for_teamwork_Implications_for_human_resource_management","258187648_Teamwork_Behaviors_A_Review_and_an_Integration_of_Frameworks","256923810_Where_Do_We_Go_From_Here_Is_Shared_Leadership_the_Key_to_Team_Success","254121226_The_Knowledge_Skill_and_Ability_Requirements_for_Teamwork_Implications_for_Human_Resource_Management","238686158_Circles_of_Learning_Cooperation_in_the_Classroom"]}
