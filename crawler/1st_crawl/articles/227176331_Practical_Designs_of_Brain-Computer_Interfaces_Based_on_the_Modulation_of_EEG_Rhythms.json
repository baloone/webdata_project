It supplies paralyzed patients with a new approach to communicate with the environment.\nAmong various brain monitoring methods employed in current BCI research, electroencephalogram (EEG) is the main interest due\nto its advantages of low cost, convenient operation and non-invasiveness. In present-day EEG-based BCIs, the following signals\nhave been paid much attention: visual evoked potential (VEP), sensorimotor mu/beta rhythms, P300 evoked potential, slow cortical\npotential (SCP), and movement-related cortical potential (MRCP). Details about these signals can be found in chapter “Brain\nSignals for Brain–Computer Interfaces”. These systems offer some practical solutions (e.g., cursor movement and word processing)\nfor patients with motor disabilities.","authors":["Yijun Wang","Xiaorong Gao","Bo Hong","Shangkai Gao"],"meta":["October 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-02091-9_8","In book: Brain-Computer Interfaces (pp.137-154)"],"references":["220057629_Steady-State_VEP-Based_Brain-Computer_Interface_Control_in_an_Immersive_3D_Gaming_Environment","293107576_Direct_brain-computer_communication","285974531_A_brain-computer_interface_using_montion-onset_visual_evoked_potential","285833494_Event-related_EEG-MEG_synchronization_and_desynchronization_Basic_principles","285773466_Control_of_a_two-dimensional_movement_signal_by_a_noninvasive_brain-computer_interface_in_humans","283409305_A_Human_Computer_Interface_Using_SSVEP-Based_BCI_Technology","254766993_Electroencephalography_basic_principles_clinical_applications_and_related","230865713_Measuring_Phase_Synchrony_in_Brain_Signals","222789183_The_brain_response_interface_communication_through_visually-induced_electrical_brain_responses","221100745_A_Human_Computer_Interface_Using_SSVEP-Based_BCI_Technology"]}
