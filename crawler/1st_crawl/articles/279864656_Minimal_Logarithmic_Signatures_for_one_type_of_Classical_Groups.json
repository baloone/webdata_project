{"id":"279864656_Minimal_Logarithmic_Signatures_for_one_type_of_Classical_Groups","abstract":"As a special type of factorization of finite groups, logarithmic signature\n(LS) is used as the main component of cryptographic keys for secret key\ncryptosystems such as PGM and public key cryptosystems like MST1, MST2 and\nMST3. An LS with the shortest length, called a minimal logarithmic signature\n(MLS), is even desirable for cryptographic applications. The MLS conjecture\nstates that every finite simple group has an MLS. Recently, the conjecture has\nbeen shown to be true for general linear groups GLn(q), special linear groups\nSLn(q), and symplectic groups Spn(q) with q a power of primes and for\northogonal groups On(q) with q as a power of 2. In this paper, we present new\nconstructions of minimal logarithmic signatures for the orthogonal group On(q)\nand SOn(q) with q as a power of odd primes. Furthermore, we give constructions\nof MLSs for a type of classical groups projective commutator subgroup.","authors":["Haibo Hong","Licheng Wang","Haseeb Ahmad","Yixian Yang"],"meta":["March 2017Applicable Algebra in Engineering Communication and Computing 28(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00200-016-0302-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["276900442_The_existence_of_minimal_logarithmic_signatures_for_the_sporadic_Suzuki_and_simple_Suzuki_groups","271921898_Minimal_logarithmic_signatures_for_the_unitary_group_U_nq_U_n_q","266843083_Minimal_logarithmic_signatures_for_finite_groups_of_Lie_type","344897014_Buildings_and_Classical_Groups","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","268494667_Spreads_Translation_Planes_and_Kerdock_Sets_II","268159709_The_Finite_Simple_Groups","267146472_Public_key_cryptosystem_MST3_Cryptanalysis_and_realization","266827285_Remarks_on_Singer_Cyclic_Groups_and_Their_Normalizers","265541116_Buildings_and_classical_groups"]}
