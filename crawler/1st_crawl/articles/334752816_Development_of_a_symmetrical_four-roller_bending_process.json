{"id":"334752816_Development_of_a_symmetrical_four-roller_bending_process","abstract":"In order to reduce the straight edge section and simplify process flow, a new symmetrical four-roller bending process is proposed, and its optimum forming process is determined. The main procedure composes of feeding, pre-bending, reverse roll bending, final bending, positive roll bending, unloading, and springback. It has advantages of less production procedure, small remaining straight edge, and simple equipment structure. Three methods are adopted to study the process, i.e., theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and physical experiment. According to the theory of elastoplastic and geometric relation, the relationship between the reduction of the upper roller and the curvature radius before and after springback is established, and the reduction of the upper roller can be predicted. The symmetrical four-roller bending process is simulated by ABAQUS software. The distribution of stress and strain is analyzed, and the theoretical curvature radius and the simulated curvature radius are compared. The rolling part is obtained from simulation with an ovality of 0.43% and only 1.5 times the thickness of the remaining straight edge. The symmetrical four-roller bending machine is designed, and the ovality of the rolling part from experiment is less than 5%, and the minimum is only 1.74%. The error of most curvature radius is less than 0.5%. Numerical simulation and physical experiments both prove the feasibility of the method. The effect of the process parameters on the curvature after springback is studied by a single variable method. This process provides a new idea for pipe production and helps improve the rolling quality.","authors":["Yu Gaochao","Jun Zhao","Changfu Xu"],"meta":["October 2019The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology 104(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00170-019-04104-3","Project: Study on the process and theory of roller-type continuous and synchronous adjusting straightness and roundness on thin-walled pipe based on the reciprocating bending"],"references":["321094739_On_Simulation_Analysis_of_Plate_Forming_and_Deformation_Compensation_Technology_of_the_side_roll_for_Four-roll_Plate_Bending_Machine","309384225_Theoretical_analysis_and_experimental_investigations_on_the_symmetrical_three-roller_setting_round_process","305460638_Elastic-plastic_secondary_indeterminate_problem_for_thin-walled_pipe_through_the_inner-wall_loading_by_three-point_bending","331479571_Modeling_and_analysis_of_process_parameters_in_multi-pass_four-roll_bending","317831112_Experiment_and_simulation_of_two-axle_bending_of_301_stainless_steel_strip_with_different_hardness_values","317224131_Rolling_round_process_of_four-roll_and_its_springback_analysis","294747691_Theoretical_analysis_and_experimental_study_on_two-axle_bending_with_elastic_roller_for_forming_non-circular_cross-section_parts","289584189_A_mechanical_model_of_symmetrical_three-roller_setting_round_process_The_static_bending_stage","286157249_Heat-assisted_roll-bending_process_dynamic_simulation","283107988_Three-dimensional_FEA_of_manufacturing_process_of_small-diameter_split_sleeve_by_two-axle_bending","280647696_Experimental_analysis_of_an_asymmetrical_three-roll_bending_process","270130575_THEORETICAL_ANALYSIS_AND_EXPERIMENTAL_STUDY_ON_TWO-AXLE_BENDING_WITH_ELASTIC_ROLLER_FOR_FORMING_NON-CIRCULAR_CROSS-SECTION_PARTS","267602321_Mathematical_Modelling_and_Finite_Element_Simulation_of_Pre-Bending_Stage_of_Three-Roller_Plate_Bending_Process","260835740_A_Refined_Model_of_Three-roller_Elastoplastic_Asymmetrical_Pre-bending_of_Plate","259161479_Bending_force_prediction_for_dynamic_roll-bending_during_3-roller_conical_bending_process"]}
