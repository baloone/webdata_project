{"id":"276950957_Weighing_Thiessen_Polygons","abstract":"Although tessellations of Thiessen polygons are attractive conceptually as simple spatial models, their value in this regard is limited by the restrictive nature of both the model assumptions and the patterns which they generate. This paper suggests two simple ways by which Thiessen polygon models can be modified to produce what are designated \"weighted polygon\" models. The approach involves the recognition that the edges in a tessellation of Thiessen polygons are a special case of Descartes' ovals. Two specific, weighted polygon models are produced using other realizations of Descartes' ovals. Both new models are given both assignment and growth interpretations, and their relationships with other existing geographic models are explored. Using equivalencies identified in this way, applications of the models are examined.","authors":["Barry N.
