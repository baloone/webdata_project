{"id":"287234132_Statistical_Reasoning_with_Set-Valued_Information_Ontic_vs_Epistemic_Views","abstract":"Sets, hence fuzzy sets, may have a conjunctive or a disjunctive reading. In the conjunctive reading a (fuzzy) set represents an object of interest for which a (gradual rather than Boolean) composite description makes sense. In contrast disjunctive (fuzzy) sets refer to the use of sets as a representation of incomplete knowledge. They do not model objects or quantities, but partial information about an underlying object or a precise quantity. In this case the fuzzy set captures uncertainty, and its membership function is a possibility distribution.We call epistemic such fuzzy sets, since they represent states of incomplete knowledge. Distinguishing between ontic and epistemic fuzzy sets is important in information-processing tasks because there is a risk of misusing basic notions and tools, such as distance between fuzzy sets, variance of a fuzzy random variable, fuzzy regression, etc. We discuss several examples where the ontic and epistemic points of view yield different approaches to these concepts.","authors":["Didier Dubois"],"meta":["January 2013Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing 285:119-136","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-30278-7_11"],"references":["266308727_Possibilistic_data_analysis_for_operations_research","224408342_On_the_Variability_of_the_Concept_of_Variance_for_Fuzzy_Random_Variables","222517240_A_new_family_of_metrics_for_compact_convex_fuzzy_sets_based_on_a_generalized_concept_of_mid_and_spread","220556053_Computing_variance_for_interval_data_is_NP-hard","346790326_Fuzzy_sets_as_a_basis_for_a_theory_of_possibility","344486892_Statistical_Reasoning_with_Imprecise_Probabilities","324338993_Decision_Order_and_Time_in_Human_Affairs","321516208_Statistics_with_Vague_Data","301860867_Fuzzy_sets_as_a_basis_for_a_theory_of_possibility_JFuzzy_Sets_and_Systems","281053511_Possibility_Theory","274909026_Statistical_Reasoning_With_Imprecise_Probabilities","270223836_Decision_Order_and_Time_in_Human_Affairs","262273968_Metric_spaces_of_fuzzy_sets","256244697_On_random_sets_and_belief_functions","251513509_Gradualness_uncertainty_and_bipolarity_Making_sense_of_fuzzy_sets","246227650_Foundation_of_a_Theory_of_Random_Sets","243649481_Statistical_Reasoning_With_Imprecise_Probabilities","242472411_Methods_and_applications_of_interval_arithmetic","239060878_When_upper_probabilities_are_possibility_measures_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems_49_65-74","239038254_A_Rationale_for_Fuzzy_Control","237127862_Random_Sets_and_Integral_Geometry","235024999_Scoring_Rules_and_the_Inevitability_of_Probability","229913006_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Evidence","229762792_Concept_of_conditional_fuzzy_measure","227563969_Formal_Representations_of_Uncertainty","227388682_Decision_Order_and_Time_In_Human_Affairs","225353959_Kriging_and_Epistemic_Uncertainty_A_Critical_Discussion","225070185_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Evidence","224256869_Maximum-likelihood_principle_for_possibility_distributions_viewed_as_families_of_probabilities","223459671_A_linear_regression_model_for_imprecise_response","222914889_Incomplete_conjunctive_information","222858897_Fuzzy_Random_Variables","222562679_Estimation_of_a_simple_linear_regression_model_for_fuzzy_random_variables","222545771_Possibility_theory_and_statistical_reasoning","222519329_Upper_and_lower_probabilities_induced_by_a_fuzzy_random_variable","222514183_Joint_propagation_of_probability_and_possibility_in_risk_analysis_Towards_a_formal_framework","222480781_The_normative_representation_of_quantified_beliefs_by_belief_functions","222460041_Fuzzy_random_variables-II_Algorithms_and_examples_for_the_discrete_case","222456104_Zadeh_LA_The_concept_of_a_linguistic_variable_and_its_application_to_approximate_reasoning_Part_1_Inform_Sci_8_199-249_Part_2_Inform_Sci_8_301-353_Part_3_Inform_Sci_9_43-80","222451932_PRUF-A_meaning_representation_language_for_natural_language","222449802_Fuzzy_random_variables_-_I_Definitions_and_theorems","222388395_Set-based_representations_of_conjunctive_and_disjunctive_knowledge","222364129_Fuzzy_least_squares","222361096_The_three_semantics_of_fuzzy_sets","222302122_Statistical_inference_about_the_means_of_fuzzy_random_variables_Applications_to_the_analysis_of_fuzzy-_and_real-valued_data","222247024_On_the_variance_of_fuzzy_random_variables","220859565_Kriging_with_Ill-Known_Variogram_and_Data","220813640_Action_representation_and_partially_observable_planning_using_epistemic_logic","220691120_Methods_and_Application_of_Interval_Analysis_Philadelphia_PA_SIAM","220555035_A_Midpoint-Radius_Approach_to_Regression_with_Interval_Data","220554100_Nonparametric_criteria_for_supervised_classification_of_fuzzy_data","220527984_Computing_the_variance_of_interval_and_fuzzy_data","220252681_Probability-Possibility_Transformations_Triangular_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Probabilistic_Inequalities","220554232_Relevance_and_truthfulness_in_information_correction_and_fusion","220527523_The_role_of_fuzzy_sets_in_decision_sciences_Old_techniques_and_new_directions"]}
