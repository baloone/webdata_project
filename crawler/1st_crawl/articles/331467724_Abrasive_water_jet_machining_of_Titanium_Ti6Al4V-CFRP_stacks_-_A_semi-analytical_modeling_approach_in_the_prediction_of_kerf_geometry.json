{"id":"331467724_Abrasive_water_jet_machining_of_Titanium_Ti6Al4V-CFRP_stacks_-_A_semi-analytical_modeling_approach_in_the_prediction_of_kerf_geometry","abstract":"The use of stacked metal-fiber material system is limited by machining challenges due to micro and macro level distinction in material phases. This study explores the machinability of stacked Ti6Al4V and CFRP material system using Abrasive Waterjet technology (AWJ). AWJ controlled depth experiments were conducted for stacked Titanium and monolithic CFRP. A strong linear relationship was identified between jet power-to-speed ratio and penetration depth for CFRP and Titanium individually, which was further used to predict the penetration depth in stacked Ti-CFRP configuration. Issues such as kerf rounding at the interface, delamination in CFRP were addressed and optimal process conditions were identified. A simplified model to predict the penetration depth was proposed which was proven to be more effective than multivariate regression model.","authors":["Rishi Pahuja","M.
