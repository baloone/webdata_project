{"id":"226393833_Characterizing_TC0_in_Terms_of_Infinite_Groups","abstract":"We characterize the languages in TC0 = L(Maj[<,Bit]) and L(Maj[<]) as inverse morphic images of certain groups. Necessarily these are infinite, since nonregular\nsets are concerned. To limit the power of these infinite algebraic objects, we equip them with a finite type set and introduce\nthe notion of a finitely typed (infinite) monoid. Following this approach we investigate type-respecting mappings and construct\na new type of block product that more adequately deals with infinite monoids. We exhibit two classes of finitely typed groups\nwhich exactly characterize TC0 and L(Maj[<]) via inverse morphisms.","authors":["Andreas Krebs","klaus-joern Lange","Stephanie Reifferscheid"],"meta":["June 2007Theory of Computing Systems 40(4):303-325","DOI:10.1007/s00224-006-1310-2"],"references":["221590846_Bounded-Width_Polynomial-Size_Branching_Programs_Recognize_Exactly_Those_Languages_in_NC","221442684_The_Crane_Beach_Conjecture","220994368_Definability_of_Languages_by_Generalized_First-Order_Formulas_over_N","266433584_Finite_Automata_Formal_Logic_and_Circuit_Complexity","256270034_The_kernel_of_monoid_morphisms","242104244_On_Uniformity_within_NC","227246336_Finite_Automata","222682259_The_descriptive_complexity_approach_to_LOGCFL","222450604_Bounded-width_polynomial-size_branching_programs_recognize_exactly_those_languages_in_NC1","221590855_Finite_Monoids_and_the_Fine_Structure_of_NC"]}
