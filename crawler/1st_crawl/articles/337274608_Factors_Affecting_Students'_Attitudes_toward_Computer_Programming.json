{"id":"337274608_Factors_Affecting_Students'_Attitudes_toward_Computer_Programming","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the pre-service computer science teachers' attitudes towards computer programming (ATCP). The sample consists of 119 pre-service teachers at a public state university. The influences of students' demographic characteristics (gender, grade level, and high school type), their achievement in computer programming courses, perceived learning, and computer programming self-efficacy on their ATCP were tested using multiple linear regression. Descriptive, correlation and regression analyses revealed three findings: (1) students had moderately high ATCP, (2) their ATCP had significant correlations with their achievement in computer programming courses, computer programming self-efficacy, and perceived learning , and (3) three variables (achievement in computer programming courses, computer programming self-efficacy, and perceived learning) were significant predictors of their ATCP.","authors":["Melih Derya Gurer","Ibrahim Cetin","Ercan Top"],"meta":["November 2019Informatics in Education 18(2):281-296","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2019.13"],"references":["322202972_Uzaktan_Egitim_Ogrencilerinin_Bilgisayar_Programlamaya_Yonelik_Tutumlarinin_Incelenmesi","322196005_Investigating_Self-Efficacy_Anxiety_Attitudes_and_Mathematics_Achievement_Regarding_Gender_and_School_Type","304925118_Analysis_of_Factors_Affecting_Achievement_in_Maker_Programming_Education_in_the_Age_of_Wireless_Communication","303792583_Computational_Thinking_The_Skill_Set_of_the_21st_Century","302977538_Investigation_of_Attitudes_Towards_Computer_Programming_in_Terms_of_Various_Variables","301796219_Discrepancies_between_Student_Perception_and_Achievement_of_Learning_Outcomes_in_a_Flipped_Classroom","322412639_The_influence_of_learners'_openness_to_IT_experience_on_the_attitude_and_perceived_learning_effectiveness_with_virtual_reality_technologies","319446898_Anonymous_versus_identified_peer_assessment_via_a_Facebook-based_learning_application_Effects_on_quality_of_peer_feedback_perceived_learning_perceived_fairness_and_attitude_toward_the_system","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","311476604_Students'_mental_models_of_recursion_at_wits"]}
