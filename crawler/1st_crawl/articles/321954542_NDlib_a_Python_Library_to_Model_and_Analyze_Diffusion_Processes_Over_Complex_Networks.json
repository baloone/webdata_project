{"id":"321954542_NDlib_a_Python_Library_to_Model_and_Analyze_Diffusion_Processes_Over_Complex_Networks","abstract":"Nowadays the analysis of dynamics of and on networks represents a hot topic in the social network analysis playground. To support students, teachers, developers and researchers, in this work we introduce a novel framework, namely NDlib, an environment designed to describe diffusion simulations. NDlib is designed to be a multi-level ecosystem that can be fruitfully used by different user segments. For this reason, upon NDlib, we designed a simulation server that allows remote execution of experiments as well as an online visualization tool that abstracts its programmatic interface and makes available the simulation platform to non-technicians.","authors":["Giulio Rossetti","Letizia Milli","Salvatore Rinzivillo","Alina SÃ®rbu"],"meta":["February 2018International Journal of Data Science and Analytics 5(1)","DOI:10.1007/s41060-017-0086-6","Project: Cimplex (FET Proactive, grant agreement 641191)"],"references":["331982905_Time-Varying_Graphs_and_Dynamic_Networks","331929461_International_Journal_of_Parallel_Emergent_and_Distributed_Systems_Time-varying_graphs_and_dynamic_networks_Time-varying_graphs_and_dynamic_networks","324652258_EpiModel_An_R_Package_for_Mathematical_Modeling_of_Infectious_Disease_over_Networks","321317133_Information_Diffusion_in_Complex_Networks_The_ActivePassive_Conundrum","318359958_Community_Discovery_in_Dynamic_Networks_A_Survey","312153320_Mixing_beliefs_among_interacting_agents","308693385_A_supervised_approach_for_intra-inter-community_interaction_prediction_in_dynamic_social_networks","308152487_Reducing_individuals'_risk_sensitiveness_can_promote_positive_and_non-alarmist_views_about_catastrophic_events_in_an_agent-based_simulation","323239055_RDyn_Graph_benchmark_handling_community_dynamics","323192506_Diffusive_Phenomena_in_Dynamic_Networks_A_Data-Driven_Study","307948315_Tiles_an_online_algorithm_for_community_discovery_in_dynamic_social_networks","303098151_Opinion_Dynamics_Models_Extensions_and_External_Effects","301627743_GEMFsim_A_Stochastic_Simulator_for_the_Generalized_Epidemic_Modeling_Framework","287250314_Predicting_links_in_ego-networks_using_temporal_information","304469278_SNAP_A_General_Purpose_Network_Analysis_and_Graph_Mining_Library"]}
