{"id":"258082303_Equations_for_formally_real_meadows","abstract":"We consider the signatures Sigma(m) = (0,1,-, +,., (-1)) of meadows and (Sigma(m),s) of signed meadows. We give two complete axiomatizations of the equational theories of the real numbers with respect to these signatures. In the first case, we extend the axiomatization of zero-totalized fields by a single axiom scheme expressing formal realness; the second axiomatization presupposes an ordering. We apply these completeness results in order to obtain complete axiomatizations of the complex numbers.","authors":["Jan Bergstra","Inge Bethke","Alban Ponse"],"meta":["October 2013Journal of Applied Logic 13(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.jal.2015.01.004","SourcearXiv"],"references":["237010083_Cancellation_Meadows_a_Generic_Basis_Theorem_and_Some_Applications","234800298_The_rational_numbers_as_an_abstract_data_type","221350662_Elementary_Algebraic_Specifications_of_the_Rational_Complex_Numbers","1916835_Cancellation_Meadows_A_Generic_Basis_Theorem_and_Some_Applications","1904264_Tuplix_Calculus","274222310_Basic_Algebra_II","264956314_A_Decision_Method_for_Elementary_Algebra_and_Geometry","243110416_Remarks_on_the_Pythagoras_and_Hasse_number_of_real_fields","242355338_A_Generic_Basis_Theorem_for_Cancellation_Meadows","239328379_A_Course_in_Model_Theory_An_introduction_to_contemporary_mathematical_logic","227285006_Algebraische_Konstruktion_reeller_Korper","222830597_Meadows_and_the_equational_specification_of_division","222228567_Existence_and_uniqueness_of_the_real_closure_of_an_ordered_field_without_Zorn's_Lemma","220148270_Meadows_and_the_equational_specification_of_division","24163156_The_structure_of_finite_meadows"]}
