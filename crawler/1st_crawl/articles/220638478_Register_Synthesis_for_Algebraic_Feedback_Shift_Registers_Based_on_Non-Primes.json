{"id":"220638478_Register_Synthesis_for_Algebraic_Feedback_Shift_Registers_Based_on_Non-Primes","abstract":"In this paper, we describe a solution to the register synthesis problem for a class of sequence generators known as Algebraic Feedback Shift Registers. These registers are based on the algebra of -adic numbers, where is an element in a ring R, and produce sequences of elements in R/( ). We give several cases where the register synthesis problem can be solved by an ecient algorithm. Consequently, any keystreams over R/( ) used in stream ciphers must be unable to be generated by a small register in these classes. This paper extends the analyses of feedback with carry shift registers and algebraic feedback shift registers by Goresky, Klapper, and Xu.","authors":["Andrew Klapper","Jinzhong Xu"],"meta":["March 2004Designs Codes and Cryptography 31(3):227-250","DOI:10.1023/B:DESI.0000015886.71135.e1","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265368743_Feedback_with_Carry_Shift_Registers_over_Z_N","241438519_The_Z_4_Linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_Related_Codes","280040957_Feedback_shift_registers_2-adic_Span_and_combiners_with_memory","268493826_p-adic_Numbers_p-adic_Analysis_and_Zeta-Functions","268243161_On_a_geometrical_representation_of_p-adic_numbers","260590682_Shift_Register_Sequences","248506897_Feedback_Shift_Registers_combiners_with_memory_and_2_-_adic_span","222455494_Approximation_lattices_of_p-adic_numbers","220942326_2-Adic_Shift_Registers","220678985_Improved_binary_codes_and_sequence_families_from_Z"]}
