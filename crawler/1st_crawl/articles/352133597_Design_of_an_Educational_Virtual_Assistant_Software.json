{"id":"352133597_Design_of_an_Educational_Virtual_Assistant_Software","abstract":"Despite the great creators’ efforts of e-learning educational materials, it is not possible to define the content of these materials specifically for all students. Based on this, it is necessary to provide in e-learning education the possibility of a more detailed interpretation of specific parts of the educational material that may be unclear to specific students. Based on this fact, we decided to take the first step in the form of software design, which will represent a virtual assistant in teaching computer science. The role of this assistant will be the ability to answer technical questions related to the presented curriculum. From an architectural point of view, it will be a set of micro-services, each of which will serve a specific task. The prerequisite is the use of decision trees to determine a specific micro-service, which will be implemented in the form of a neural network. Main aim of this paper is to provide detail description of global software architecture for such a virtual assistant","authors":["Dominik Halvoník","Peter Pšenák"],"meta":["June 2021International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 16(11):308","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v16i11.19847"],"references":["342133192_Framework_for_e-Learning_Materials_Optimization","339444503_Student_Anxiety_and_Fear_of_Negative_Evaluation_in_Active_Learning_Science_Classrooms","339438103_Bot_in_the_Bunch_Facilitating_Group_Chat_Discussion_by_Improving_Efficiency_and_Participation_with_a_Chatbot","339071502_Improvement_of_Misleading_and_Fake_News_Classification_for_Flective_Languages_by_Morphological_Group_Analysis","330642615_Evaluating_Moodle_use_via_Smart_Mobile_Phones_A_case_study_in_a_Greek_University","345871070_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Virtual_Assistant-Working_Model","343642092_Learning_Content_Recommendations_on_Personalized_Learning_Environment_Using_Collaborative_Filtering_Method","336451196_A_composite_neural_network_that_learns_from_multi-fidelity_data_Application_to_function_approximation_and_inverse_PDE_problems","328257121_Transforming_the_communication_between_citizens_and_government_through_AI-guided_chatbots","324899456_Effects_of_workload_on_teachers'_functioning_A_moderated_mediation_model_including_sleeping_problems_and_overcommitment","320968321_Computer-aided_education_and_evaluation_of_student_exam_tasks_from_MS_Excel","314938892_Comparing_Speech_Recognition_Systems_Microsoft_API_Google_API_And_CMU_Sphinx","311065573_Using_Mobile_Technologies_in_University_Education","310951862_Introducing_Mobile_Motivated_Lectures","314200797_Where_Students_Start_and_What_They_Do_When_They_Get_Stuck_A_Qualitative_Inquiry_into_Academic_Information-Seeking_and_Help-Seeking_Practices"]}
