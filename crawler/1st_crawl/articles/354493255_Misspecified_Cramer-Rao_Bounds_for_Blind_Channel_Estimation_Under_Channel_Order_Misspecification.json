{"id":"354493255_Misspecified_Cramer-Rao_Bounds_for_Blind_Channel_Estimation_Under_Channel_Order_Misspecification","abstract":"In estimation, the misspecified Cramer–Rao bound\n(MCRB), which is an extension of the well-known Cramer–Rao\nbound (CRB) when the underlying system model is misspecified,\nhas recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we introduce\na new interpretation of the MCRB, called the generalized MCRB\n(GMCRB), via the Moore–Penrose inverse operator. This bound\nis useful for singular problems and particularly blind channel\nestimation problems in which the Hessian matrix is noninvertible.\nTwo closed-form expressions of the GMCRB are derived for\nunbiased blind estimators when the channel order is misspecified.\nThe first bound deals with deterministic models where both the\nchannel and unknown symbols are deterministic. The second\none is devoted to stochastic models where we assume that\ntransmitted symbols are unknown random variables i.i.d. drawn\nfrom a Gaussian distribution. Two case studies of channel order\nmisspecification are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed GMCRBs over the classical CRBs. When the\nchannel order is known or accurately estimated, both generalized\nbounds reduce to the classical bounds. Besides, the stochastic\nGMCRB is lower than the deterministic one, especially at high\nSNR.","authors":["Le Trung Thanh","Karim abed-meraim","Nguyen Linh-Trung"],"meta":["September 2021IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 69:5372-5385","DOI:10.1109/TSP.2021.3111558"],"references":["351514023_Performance_Lower_Bounds_of_Blind_System_Identification_Techniques_in_the_Presence_of_Channel_Order_Estimation_Error","344350138_On_the_Gaussian_Cramer-Rao_Bound_for_Blind_Single-Input_Multiple-Output_System_Identification_Fast_and_Asymptotic_Computations","341084651_Misspecified_Cramer-Rao_Bound_For_Delay_Estimation_with_a_Mismatched_Waveform_A_Case_Study","320032918_Performance_Bounds_for_Parameter_Estimation_under_Misspecified_Models_Fundamental_Findings_and_Applications","319262701_Misspecified_Cramer-Rao_Bounds_for_Complex_Unconstrained_and_Constrained_Parameters","341084282_On_Harmonic_Approximations_of_Inharmonic_Signals","329333718_Cramer-Rao_Bound_for_Constrained_Parameter_Estimation_Using_Lehmann-Unbiasedness","325665966_Fisher_Information_Matrix_of_Unipolar_Activation_Function-Based_Multilayer_Perceptrons","322202314_Blind_estimation_of_channel_order_and_SNR_for_OFDM_systems","318658541_Slepian-Bangs-type_formulas_and_the_related_Misspecified_Cramer-Rao_Bounds_for_Complex_Elliptically_Symmetric_Distributions","317867840_Performance_Bounds_Analysis_for_Semi-Blind_Channel_Estimation_in_MIMO-OFDM_Communications_Systems","308610109_On_the_Non-Existence_of_Unbiased_Estimators_in_Constrained_Estimation_Problems","315782086_Blind_Signal_Detection_in_Massive_MIMO_Exploiting_the_Channel_Sparsity","312911773_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_of_misspecified_models","305890965_Computational_Methods_for_Linear_Matrix_Equations"]}
