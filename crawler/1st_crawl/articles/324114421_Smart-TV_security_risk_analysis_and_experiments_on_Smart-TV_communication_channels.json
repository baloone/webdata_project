{"id":"324114421_Smart-TV_security_risk_analysis_and_experiments_on_Smart-TV_communication_channels","abstract":"This paper focuses on the security threats related to smart-TV communication channels. A risk analysis is carried out to have a global view of potential risks that need to be addressed in the context of Smart-TV communication links. The feasibility of several identified risks is investigated experimentally. The experiments show some relevant security-related vulnerabilities on Smart-TV communications channels. Countermeasures to address these vulnerabilities are also investigated.","authors":["Yann Bachy","Vincent Nicomette","Mohamed Kaaniche","Eric Alata"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Computer Virology and Hacking Techniques 15(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11416-018-0320-3"],"references":["280595806_Smart-TV_security_analysis_practical_experiments","269291214_A_privacy_protection_system_for_HbbTV_in_Smart_TVs","268240467_Watch_and_be_watched_Compromising_all_Smart_TV_generations","262300605_Broadcasting_System_Compliant_with_MPEG-24_IPMPX","314929917_Smart-TV_Security_Analysis_Practical_Experiments","275249519_Attacking_the_Internet_Using_Broadcast_Digital_Television","255960244_Outsourcing_Home_Network_Security","221374430_An_MPEG-4_IPMPX_design_and_implementation_on_MPEG-21_test_bed","220687895_The_Design_of_Rijndael_AES_-_The_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","45816566_Analysis_of_the_DVB_Common_Scrambling_Algorithm","3727471_The_DVB_Terrestrial_DVB-T_specification_and_its_implementation_in_a_practical_modem","3617404_The_DVB_project-digital_television_for_Europe"]}
