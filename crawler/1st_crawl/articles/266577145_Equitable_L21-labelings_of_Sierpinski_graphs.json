{"id":"266577145_Equitable_L21-labelings_of_Sierpinski_graphs","abstract":"An L(2,1)-labeling of a graph G is equitable if the number of elements in any two color classes differ by at most one. The equitable L(2,1)-labeling number λ e (G) of G is the smallest integer k such that G has an equitable L(2,1)-labeling. Sierpiński graphs S(n,k) generalize the Tower of Hanoi graphs – the graph S(n,3) is isomorphic to the graph of the Tower of Hanoi with n disks. In this paper, we show that for any n≥2 and any k≥2, λ e (S(n,k))=2k.","authors":["Hong-Yong Fu","Dezheng Xie"],"meta":["February 2010"],"references":["268859598_Codes_and_L21-labelings_in_Sierpinski_graphs","267061645_Some_results_on_equalized_total_coloring","266988884_On_some_metric_properties_of_the_Sierpinski_graphs_Snk","268613709_Lipscomb's_LA_Space_Fractalized_in_Hilbert's_l_2_A_Space","267164792_Coloring_Sierpinski_graphs_and_Sierpinski_gasket_graphs","227780822_Crossing_numbers_of_Sierpinski-like_graphs","225177073_Equitable_Total_Coloring_of_Graphs_with_Maximum_Degree_3","222604606_Error-correcting_codes_on_the_towers_of_Hanoi_graphs","222405774_No-hole_L21-colorings","220532810_On_the_Structure_of_Graphs_with_Non-Surjective_L_21-Labelings","220317692_The_L21-labeling_on_Cartesian_sum_of_graphs","37437091_Equitable_colorations_of_graphs","3452325_The_D2-conjecture_for_L21-labelings_is_true_for_direct_and_strong_products_of_graphs"]}
