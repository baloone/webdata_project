{"id":"225806659_Prototype-based_classification","abstract":"Image-based diagnostic tools are important tools for the determination of diseases in many medical applications. The interpretation\nof these images is often done manually, based on prototypical images. Consequently, only a few images collected into an image\ncatalogue are initially available as a basis for the development of an automatic image-interpretation system. In this paper\nwe study the question if it is possible to build up an image-interpretation system based on such an image catalogue. We call\nthe system catalogue-based image classifier. The system is provided with feature-subset selection, feature weighting, and\nprototype selection. The performance of the catalogue-based classifier is assessed by studying the accuracy and the reduction\nof the prototypes after applying a prototype-selection algorithm. We describe the results that could be achieved and give\nan outlook for further developments on a catalogue-based classifier.","authors":["Petra Perner"],"meta":["June 2008Applied Intelligence 28(3):238-246","DOI:10.1007/s10489-007-0064-0","SourceDBLP"],"references":["237442819_Improving_the_Accuracy_of_Decision_Tree_Induction_by_Feature_Pre-Selection","228957037_CBR-Based_Ultra_Sonic_Image_Interpretation","321558728_Advances_in_Data_Mining_Applications_in_E-Commerce_Medicine_and_Knowledge_Management","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","243764749_Cognitive_Psychology_A_Student''s_Handbook","238789808_Psychology_A_Student's_Handbook","234433463_Histogram_Modification_for_Threshold_Selection","233821023_Cognitive_psychology_A_students_handbook","232203667_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_From_Gray-Level_Histograms","225070291_Competence-Guided_Case-Base_Editing_Techniques"]}
