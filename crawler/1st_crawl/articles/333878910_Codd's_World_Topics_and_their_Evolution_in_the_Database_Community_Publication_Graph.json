{"id":"333878910_Codd's_World_Topics_and_their_Evolution_in_the_Database_Community_Publication_Graph","abstract":"Scholarly network analysis is the study of a scientific research network aiming to discover meaningful insights and making data-driven research decisions. Analyzing such networks has become increasingly challenging, due to the amount of scientific research that is added every day. Furthermore, online resources often include information from other online sources (e.g., academic social platforms), enabling to study networks on a larger and more complex scope. In this paper, we present a study on a specific research network: The (relational) database community publication graph, that we call Coddâ€™s World; a transitive closure over citations from the foundational work of E.F. Codd. We specifically analyze the topics of the published papers, the relevance of authors and papers, and how this relates to raw publication counts. Among our findings, we show that topic modeling can be a useful entry point for scholarly network analysis.","authors":["Rutuja Shivraj Pawar","Sepideh sadat Sobhgol","Gabriel Campero Durand","Marcus Pinnecke"],"meta":["June 2019","Conference: 31st GI-Workshop on Foundations of Databases (Grundlagen von Datenbanken), 11.06.2019 - 14.06.2019, Saarburg, GermanyAt: Saarburg, GermanyVolume: Vol-2367","Project: COOPeR: Cross-device OLTP/OLAP PRocessing"],"references":["312178100_Big_Scholarly_Data_A_Survey","303902034_Mining_Advisor-Advisee_Relationships_in_Scholarly_Big_Data_A_Deep_Learning_Approach","286921594_TOM_A_library_for_topic_modeling_and_browsing","286921407_Topic_modeling_and_hypergraph_mining_to_analyze_the_EGC_conference_history","318918034_A_Century_of_Science_Globalization_of_Scientific_Collaborations_Citations_and_Innovations","307822863_An_Overview_of_Microsoft_Academic_Service_MAS_and_Applications","265846328_Scholarly_Networks_Analysis","260282046_Scholarly_Network_Similarities_How_Bibliographic_Coupling_Networks_Citation_Networks_Cocitation_Networks_Topical_Networks_Coauthorship_Networks_and_Coword_Networks_Relate_to_Each_Other","236147351_Eigenfactor_Measuring_the_value_and_prestige_of_scholarly_journals","221996591_The_PageRank_Citation_Ranking_Bringing_Order_to_the_Web"]}
