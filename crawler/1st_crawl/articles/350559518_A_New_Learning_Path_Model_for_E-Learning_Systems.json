{"id":"350559518_A_New_Learning_Path_Model_for_E-Learning_Systems","abstract":"This work presents a new approach to the learning path model in e-learning systems. The model uses data from the database records from an e-learning system and uses graphs as representation. In this work, the authors show how the model can be used to represent visually the learning paths, behavior analysis, help to suggest group formation for collaborative activities, and thus assist the teacher in making decisions. To validate the practical utility of the model, the authors created two tools, one to visualize the learning paths and another to suggest groups of students for collaborative activities. Both tools were tested in a real environment, presenting useful results. The authors carried experiments with students from three programs: physics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Experiments show that it is possible to use the proposed learning path to analyze student behavior patterns and recommend group formation with positive results.","authors":["David Brito Ramos","Ilmara Monteverde Martins Ramos","Isabela Gasparini","Elaine Harada Teixeira de Oliveira"],"meta":["April 2021International Journal of Distance Education Technologies 19(2):34-54","DOI:10.4018/IJDET.20210401.oa2"],"references":["309033238_Modeling_Skill_Combination_Patterns_for_Deeper_Knowledge_Tracing","286588859_Grouping_in_collaborative_e-learning_environment_based_on_interaction_among_students","283683943_Trilhas_de_Aprendizagem_em_Ambientes_Virtuais_de_Ensino-aprendizagem_Uma_Revisao_Sistematica_da_Literatura","338309546_Learning_Path_Recommendation_System_for_Programming_Education_Based_on_Neural_Networks","334377983_Visual_Analysis_for_Monitoring_Students_in_Distance_Courses","332700811_An_Early_Feedback_Prediction_System_for_Learners_At-Risk_Within_a_First-Year_Higher_Education_Course","329496486_A_Concept_Map-Based_Learning_Paths_Automatic_Generation_Algorithm_for_Adaptive_Learning_Systems","271555539_Learner_classification_based_on_learning_behavior_and_performance","269326649_Learning_in_Moodle_using_Competence-Based_Knowledge_Space_Theory_and_IMS_QTI","261959919_EGraph_tool_Graphing_the_learning_process_in_LMSs"]}
