{"id":"220978473_Dynamic_Generation_of_Dilemma-based_Interactive_Narratives","abstract":"This paper presents a system which automatically gen- erates interactive stories. These are focused on dilem- mas in order to create dramatic tension. The system is provided with knowledge of generic story actions and dilemmas based on those cliches encountered in many of today's soap operas. The story designer is only re- quired to provide genre specific storyworld knowledge, such as information on characters and their relations, lo- cations and actions. These dilemmas and story actions are instantiated for the given storyworld and a story planner creates sequences of actions that each lead to a dilemma for a character (who can be the user). The user interacts with the story by making decisions on relevant dilemmas and by freely choosing their own actions. Us- ing this input the system chooses and adapts future story lines according to the user's past behaviour.","authors":["Heather Barber","Daniel Kudenko"],"meta":["January 2007","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Third Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference, June 6-8, 2007, Stanford, California, USA."],"references":["270960091_An_architecture_for_integrating_plan-based_behavior_generation_with_interactive_game_environments","243770586_IDtension_a_narrative_engine_for_Interactive_Drama","228655256_Applying_a_plan-recognitionplan-generation_paradigm_to_interactive_storytelling","228618728_Author_in_the_loop_Using_mixed-initiative_planning_to_improve_interactive_narrative","228362028_A_user_model_for_the_generation_of_dilemma-based_interactive_narratives","220978440_Story_Representation_and_Interactive_Drama","220978360_Dialogue_Generation_in_Character-based_Interactive_Storytelling","220816236_Dynamic_User-Centered_Resolution_in_Interactive_Stories","220982700_Integrating_plan-based_behavior_generation_with_game_environments","31760817_Chris_Crawford_on_Interactive_Storytelling_C_Crawford"]}
