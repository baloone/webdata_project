{"id":"332234165_Towards_a_Structural_Proof_Theory_of_Probabilistic_mu_-Calculi","abstract":"We present a structural proof system, based on the machinery of hypersequent calculi, for a simple probabilistic modal logic underlying very expressive probabilistic \\(\\mu \\)-calculi. We prove the soundness and completeness of the proof system with respect to an equational axiomatisation and the fundamental cut-elimination theorem.","authors":["Christophe Lucas","Matteo Mio"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-17127-8_24","In book: Enzymatic Polymerization towards Green Polymer Chemistry (pp.418-435)"],"references":["221342982_Bounded_Lukasiewicz_Logics","220690719_Principles_of_Model_Checking","220332941_Formal_Certification_of_Code-Based_Cryptographic_Proofs","220297575_On_the_Proof_Theory_of_the_Modal_mu-Calculus","2258189_A_Logic_for_Reasoning_about_Time_and_Reliability","1956733_Results_on_the_quantitative_mu-calculus_qMu","327954202_Probabilistic_Couplings_For_Probabilistic_Reasoning","326029037_Riesz_Modal_Logic_with_Threshold_Operators","322354691_On_the_infinitary_proof_theory_of_logics_with_fixed_points","321610906_Proof_Theory_of_Modal_Logic","320707110_Probabilistic_Couplings_for_Probabilistic_Reasoning","319053677_Riesz_Modal_logic_for_Markov_processes","317543109_A_Real-Valued_Modal_Logic","314274549_Lukasiewicz_m-calculus","312657216_Uniform_cut-free_formulations_of_T_S4_and_S5_abstract","300077793_Probabilistic_CTL_The_Deductive_Way","281162586_An_introduction_to_proof_theory","268069660_Upper-Expectation_Bisimilarity_and_Lukasiewicz_m-Calculus","265351891_Proof_Theory_for_Fuzzy_Logics","262220404_A_Proof_System_for_Compositional_Verification_of_Probabilistic_Concurrent_Processes","256423021_Lukasiewicz_mu-Calculus","251257024_Untersuchungen_uber_das_logische_Schliessen_II","240060811_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Partially_Ordered_Spaces","239665785_Cambridge_tracts_in_theoretical_computer_science","234829877_Formal_certification_of_code-based_cryptographic_proofs","232959023_Probabilistic_Modal_m-Calculus_with_Independent_Product","232716920_Results_on_the_Propositional_mu-Calculus","229342296_An_Introduction_to_Proof_Theory","224872366_On_the_equivalence_of_game_and_denotational_semantics_for_the_probabilistic_m_-calculus","222452014_A_probabilistic_PDL","221570359_Probabilistic_Modal","220700707_Quantitative_Verification_and_Control_via_the_Mu-Calculus","220613569_Results_on_the_quantitative_m-calculus_qM_m","220613512_Sequent_and_hypersequent_calculi_for_Abelian_and_Lukasiewicz_logics","220387944_Sequent_calculi_for_induction_and_infinite_descent","220316287_A_Constructive_Analysis_of_RM","220248873_Reasoning_with_Time_and_Chance","3707382_Quantitative_analysis_and_model_checking","2835380_Approximating_Labelled_Markov_Processes"]}
