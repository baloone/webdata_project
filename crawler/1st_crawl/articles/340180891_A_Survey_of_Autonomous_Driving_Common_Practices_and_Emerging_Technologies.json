{"id":"340180891_A_Survey_of_Autonomous_Driving_Common_Practices_and_Emerging_Technologies","abstract":"Automated driving systems (ADSs) promise a safe, comfortable and efficient driving experience. However, fatalities involving vehicles equipped with ADSs are on the rise. The full potential of ADSs cannot be realized unless the robustness of state-of-the-art is improved further. This paper discusses unsolved problems and surveys the technical aspect of automated driving. Studies regarding present challenges, highlevel system architectures, emerging methodologies and core functions including localization, mapping, perception, planning, and human machine interfaces, were thoroughly reviewed. Furthermore, many stateof- the-art algorithms were implemented and compared on our own platform in a real-world driving setting. The paper concludes with an overview of available datasets and tools for ADS development.","authors":["Ekim Yurtsever","Jacob Lambert","Alexander Carballo","Kazuya Takeda"],"meta":["March 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2983149"],"references":["339558304_Accurate_Monocular_3D_Object_Detection_via_Color-Embedded_3D_Reconstruction_for_Autonomous_Driving","337625064_Risky_Action_Recognition_in_Lane_Change_Video_Clips_using_Deep_Spatiotemporal_Networks_with_Segmentation_Mask_Transfer","337242257_Information-Centric_Network-Based_Vehicular_Communications_Overview_and_Research_Opportunities","336934637_Deep_Learning_for_Generic_Object_Detection_A_Survey","343456393_nuScenes_A_Multimodal_Dataset_for_Autonomous_Driving","343420616_Self-driving_cars_A_survey","339290936_Event-based_Vision_A_Survey","338514062_PointPillars_Fast_Encoders_for_Object_Detection_From_Point_Clouds","338513080_PointRCNN_3D_Object_Proposal_Generation_and_Detection_From_Point_Cloud","336569508_Learning_Depth_with_Convolutional_Spatial_Propagation_Network"]}
