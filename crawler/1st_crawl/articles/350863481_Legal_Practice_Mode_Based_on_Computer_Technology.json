{"id":"350863481_Legal_Practice_Mode_Based_on_Computer_Technology","abstract":"With the rapid development of computer science and technology, virtual reality technology emerges as the times require, and is valued and favored by all walks of life. Law education has always been based on theoretical teaching, through a large number of theoretical recitation and contact, to improve students’ legal professional performance, but this teaching mode often leads to the plight of students with sufficient theoretical knowledge but lack of practical ability. This paper mainly designs and tests a VR education platform based on computer technology, and carries out a comparative experiment on law major classes in Colleges and universities in this city. The test data show that the response speed of the platform is less than 3 seconds, and the compressive capacity meets the requirements of this experiment. Through the analysis of the experimental data for one month, VR education platform based on computer technology can cultivate students’ practical ability, and effectively solve the dilemma of law students’ emphasis on theory but not on practice.","authors":["Sisi Chen"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1852(4):042014","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1852/4/042014"],"references":["268873784_Impaired_spatial_selectivity_and_intact_phase_precession_in_two-dimensional_virtual_reality","238449058_Legal_Education_in_Asia","5238538_Simulation_of_single-species_bacterial-biofilm_growth_using_the_Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg_model_and_the_CompuCell3D_modeling_environment","313508386_Interprofessional_Medical-Legal_Education_of_Medical_Students_Assessing_the_Benefits_for_Addressing_Social_Determinants_of_Health","301319258_Virtual_Reality_for_Stroke_Rehabilitation","279989570_Virtual_reality_for_stroke_rehabilitation_An_abridged_version_of_a_Cochrane_review","271540012_Homuncular_Flexibility_in_Virtual_Reality"]}
