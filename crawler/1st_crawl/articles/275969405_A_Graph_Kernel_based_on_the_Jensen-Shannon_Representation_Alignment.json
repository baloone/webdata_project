{"id":"275969405_A_Graph_Kernel_based_on_the_Jensen-Shannon_Representation_Alignment","abstract":"In this paper, we develop a novel graph kernel byaligning the Jensen-Shannon (JS) representationsof vertices. We commence by describing how tocompute the JS representation of a vertex by measuring the JS divergence (JSD) between the corresponding h-layer depth-based (DB) representations developed in [Baiet al., 2014a]). By aligning JS representations of vertices, we identify the correspondence between the vertices of two graphs and this allows us to construct a matching-based graph kernel. Unlike existing R-convolution kernels [Haussler, 1999] that roughly record the isomorphism information between any pair of sub-structures under a type of graph decomposition, the new kernel can be seen as an aligned subgraph kernel that incorporates explicit local correspondences of substructures (i.e., the local information graphs [Dehmer and Mowshowitz, 2011]) into the process of kernelization through the JS representation alignment. The new kernel thus addresses the drawback of neglecting the relative locations between substructures that arises in the R-convolution kernels. Experiments demonstrate that our kernel can easily outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels in terms of the classification accuracies.","authors":["Lu Bai","Zhihong Zhang","Chaoyan Wang","Xiao Bai"],"meta":["May 2015","Conference: International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)"],"references":["269997422_Information_Theoretic_Graph_Kernels","266220478_Coding_of_an_information_source_having_ambiguous_alphabet_and_the_entropy_of_graphs","264046382_Attributed_Graph_Kernels_Using_the_Jensen-Tsallis_q-Differences","264046366_A_Graph_Kernel_from_the_Depth-Based_Representation","261357339_A_Quantum_Jensen-Shannon_Graph_Kernel_for_Unattributed_Graphs","260707708_Backtrackless_Walks_on_a_Graph","256592692_Depth-Based_Complexity_Traces_of_Graphs","237087432_3D_shape_retrieval_using_Kernels_on_Extended_Reeb_Graphs","236110992_Graph_Kernels_from_the_Jensen-Shannon_Divergence","236110929_Jensen-Shannon_graph_kernel_using_information_functionals"]}
