{"id":"222549523_On_shadowing_Ordinary_and_ergodic","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of ergodic shadowing for a continuous onto map which is equivalent to the map being topologically mixing and has the ordinary shadowing property. In particular, we deduce the chaotic behavior of a map with ergodic shadowing property. Moreover, we define some kind of specification property and investigate its relation to the ergodic shadowing property.","authors":["Abbas Fakhari","F.
