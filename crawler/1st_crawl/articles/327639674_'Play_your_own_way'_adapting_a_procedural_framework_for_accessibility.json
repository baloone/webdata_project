{"id":"327639674_'Play_your_own_way'_adapting_a_procedural_framework_for_accessibility","abstract":"Sure Footing is a research project cum commercial product that arose from exploring generative systems for infinite runner games that balanced procedural flexibility with authorial intent. The approach taken as part of the games level generation systems allows not only for the gradual increase in difficulty as players progress, but allow for specific configurations that allow for the unique configurations that embody a level of difficulty or challenge. This paper explores ongoing development of the generation framework to to enable this flexibility, as well as raise consideration for flexible generation in the context of accessibility for players of varying competencies.","authors":["Tommy Thompson","Matthew Syrett"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3235765.3235818","Conference: the 13th International Conference"],"references":["326168155_Evolving_mario_levels_in_the_latent_space_of_a_deep_convolutional_generative_adversarial_network","301845414_Toward_Game_Level_Generation_from_Gameplay_Videos","280943746_Discerning_Human_and_Procedurally_Crafted_Content_for_Video_Games","260658514_Experience-Driven_Procedural_Content_Generation","235974388_Patterns_and_Procedural_Content_Generation_Revisiting_Mario_in_World_1_Level_1","235974381_The_Mario_AI_Benchmark_and_Competitions","224501962_Real-Time_Game_Adaptation_for_Optimizing_Player_Satisfaction","224255795_The_2010_Mario_AI_Championship_Level_Generation_Track","224232404_Search-Based_Procedural_Content_Generation_A_Taxonomy_and_Survey","224198871_Launchpad_A_Rhythm-Based_Level_Generator_for_2-D_Platformers","221612615_Player_Modeling_for_Intelligent_Difficulty_Adjustment","220982524_The_case_for_dynamic_difficulty_adjustment_in_games","220606739_Game_accessibility_A_survey","301841576_Super_Mario_as_a_String_Platformer_Level_Generation_Via_LSTMs","272756368_Optimal_Experience_Psychological_Studies_of_Flow_in_Consciousness","220978497_Procedural_Level_Design_for_Platform_Games","220302098_Dynamic_Difficulty_Adjustment_in_Computer_Games_Through_Real-Time_Anxiety-Based_Affective_Feedback"]}
