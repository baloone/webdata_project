{"id":"311737008_Learning_a_No-Reference_Quality_Metric_for_Single-Image_Super-Resolution","abstract":"Numerous single-image super-resolution algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but few studies address the problem of performance evaluation based on visual perception. While most super-resolution images are evaluated by fullreference metrics, the effectiveness is not clear and the required ground-truth images are not always available in practice. To address these problems, we conduct human subject studies using a large set of super-resolution images and propose a no-reference metric learned from visual perceptual scores. Specifically, we design three types of low-level statistical features in both spatial and frequency domains to quantify super-resolved artifacts, and learn a two-stage regression model to predict the quality scores of super-resolution images without referring to ground-truth images. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed metric is effective and efficient to assess the quality of super-resolution images based on human perception.","authors":["Chao Ma","Chih-Yuan Yang","Xiaokang Yang","Ming-Hsuan Yang"],"meta":["December 2016Computer Vision and Image Understanding","DOI:10.1016/j.cviu.2016.12.009"],"references":["278693824_Single-Image_Super-Resolution_A_Benchmark","264552416_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","261387265_Objective_quality_assessment_for_image_super-resolution_A_natural_scene_statistics_approach","226117099_On_Advances_in_Statistical_Modeling_of_Natural_Images","224138603_Image_Super-Resolution_Via_Sparse_Representation","224135979_Super-Resolution_from_a_Single_Image","222444142_Improving_resolution_by_image_registration","221363945_Image_super-resolution_using_gradient_profile_prior","221362730_A_Content-Aware_Image_Prior","220050520_Most_apparent_distortion_Full-reference_image_quality_assessment_and_the_role_of_strategy","49646230_Gradient_Profile_Prior_and_Its_Applications_in_Image_Super-Resolution_and_Enhancement","3327793_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","3077959_Shiftable_multiscale_transforms","2930678_Comparative_Analysis_of_Bradley-Terry_and_Thurstone-Mosteller_Paired_Comparison_Models_for_Image_Quality_Assessment","319770198_Learning_a_Deep_Convolutional_Network_for_Image_Super-Resolution","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","308852884_Fast_and_accurate_image_upscaling_with_super-resolution_forests","303057852_Decision_forests_A_unified_framework_for_classification_regression_density_estimation_manifold_learning_and_semi-supervised_learning","288906520_Random_forests","288640908_A_Adjusted_Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Super-Resolution","286813680_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_No-Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment","286813676_Blind_Image_Quality_Assessment_Using_Semi-supervised_Rectifier_Networks","286594819_Active_Sampling_for_Subjective_Image_Quality_Assessment","275340906_Random_Forests","267118234_Introduction_to_Mathematical_Statistics","262332404_Fast_Direct_Super-Resolution_by_Simple_Functions","262323537_Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution","262295293_A_No-Reference_Metric_for_Evaluating_the_Quality_of_Motion_Deblurring","261348928_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning_Framework_for_No-reference_Image_Quality_Assessment","261259210_Fast_Image_Super-Resolution_Based_on_In-Place_Example_Regression","258304769_Machine_Learning_Volume_45_Number_1_-_SpringerLink","234802517_What's_wrong_with_mean-squared_error","230713642_No-Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment_in_the_Spatial_Domain","228986240_Advances_and_challenges_in_Super-Resolution","224393835_A_No-Reference_Objective_Image_Sharpness_Metric_Based_on_the_Notion_of_Just_Noticeable_Blur_JNB","224254806_Learning_a_Blind_Measure_of_Perceptual_Image_Quality","224232241_Blind_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Natural_Scene_Statistics_to_Perceptual_Quality","224216147_FSIM_A_Feature_SIMilarity_index_for_image_quality_assessment","224215058_Image_Deblurring_and_Super-Resolution_by_Adaptive_Sparse_Domain_Selection_and_Adaptive_Regularization","224125144_A_Two-Step_Framework_for_Constructing_Blind_Image_Quality_Indices","224107186_Single-Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Sparse_Regression_and_Natural_Image_Prior","224057725_Quality_assessment_for_super-resolution_image_enhancement","221978609_Blind_Image_Quality_Assessment_A_Natural_Scene_Statistics_Approach_in_the_DCT_Domain","220184280_Fast_ImageVideo_Upsampling","220183775_Poisson_image_editing","6720907_A_Statistical_Evaluation_of_Recent_Full_Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment_Algorithms","3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics","3328063_An_information_fidelity_criterion_for_image_quality_assessment_using_natural_scene_statistics"]}
