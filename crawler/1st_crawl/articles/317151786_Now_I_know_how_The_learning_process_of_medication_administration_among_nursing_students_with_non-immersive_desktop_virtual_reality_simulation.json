We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our Pharmacology Inter-Leaved Learning Virtual Reality (PILL-VR) simulation when applied to nursing education, as a tool for learning medication administration procedures. A quasi-experimental pretest-intervention-posttest comparison group design was conducted based on quantitative analysis of questionnaires, video recordings and worksheets. Participants were nursing students who either learned medication administration processes with a PILL-VR simulation platform (experimental group; n = 82) or who learned with lecture-based curriculum (n = 47; comparison group). The results revealed significantly higher conceptual and procedural knowledge learning gains following activity with the PILL-VR simulation compared to studying via lecture-based curriculum. PILL-VR exposed the students to their own errors, allowing procedure rehearsal followed by constant feedback which is essential to skill acquisition. Although PILL-VR is based on a desktop system, it facilitated a strong sense of presence. A small positive correlation was found on questionnaire scores between the sense of presence, particularly the sense of control, and conceptual-procedural learning of medication administration. This indicates that by improving students' sense of control in the PILL-VR, the learning process can be improved. Hence, VR simulations may provide affordable and flexible access to practice necessary practical skills in higher education, which is crucial to developing studentsâ€™ expertise.","authors":["Ilana Dubovi","Sharona T.
