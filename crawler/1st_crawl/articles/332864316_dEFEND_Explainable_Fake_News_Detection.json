{"id":"332864316_dEFEND_Explainable_Fake_News_Detection","abstract":"In recent years, to mitigate the problem of fake news, computational detection of fake news has been studied, producing some promising early results. While important, however, we argue that a critical missing piece of the study be the explainability of such detection, i.e., why a particular piece of news is detected as fake. In this paper, therefore, we study the explainable detection of fake news. We develop a sentence-comment co-attention sub-network to exploit both news contents and user comments to jointly capture explainable top-$k$ check-worthy sentences and user comments for fake news detection. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate that the proposed explainable detection method not only significantly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art fake news detection methods by at least 5.33\\% in F1-score but also (concurrently) identifies top-k user comments that explain why a news piece is fake, better than baselines by 28.2\\% in NDCG and 30.7\\% in Precision.","authors":["Kai Shu","Limeng Cui","Suhang Wang","Dongwon Lee"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1145/3292500.3330935","Conference: KDD","Project: Fake News Detection and Mitigation on Social Media"],"references":["338616836_The_role_of_user_profiles_for_fake_news_detection","335481117_Unsupervised_Fake_News_Detection_on_Social_Media_A_Generative_Approach","330027991_Towards_Interpretation_of_Recommender_Systems_with_Sorted_Explanation_Paths","328650077_Unsupervised_Fake_News_Detection_on_Social_Media_A_Generative_Approach","328491116_Fake_News_Fundamental_Theories_Detection_Strategies_and_Challenges","334600249_Learning_Hierarchical_Discourse-level_Structure_for_Fake_News_Detection","334115084_A_Stylometric_Inquiry_into_Hyperpartisan_and_Fake_News","333067549_XFake_Explainable_Fake_News_Detector_with_Visualizations","331662438_Representation_Interpretation_with_Spatial_Encoding_and_Multimodal_Analytics","328519945_Semi-supervised_Content-Based_Detection_of_Misinformation_via_Tensor_Embeddings"]}
