{"id":"328621172_Temporal_Task_Scheduling_of_Multiple_Delay-Constrained_Applications_in_Green_Hybrid_Cloud","abstract":"A growing number of global companies select Green Data Centers (GDCs) to manage their delay-constrained applications. The fast growth of users' tasks dramatically increases the energy consumed by GDCs owned by a company, e.g., Google and Amazon. The random nature of tasks brings a big challenge of scheduling tasks of each application with limited infrastructure resources of GDCs. Therefore, hybrid cloud is widely employed to smartly outsource some tasks to public clouds. However, the temporal variation in many factors including revenue, price of power grid, solar irradiance, wind speed, price of public clouds makes it challenging to schedule all tasks of each application in a cost-effective way while strictly meeting their expected delay constraints. This work proposes a temporal task scheduling algorithm investigating the temporal variation in green hybrid cloud to schedule all tasks within their delay constraints. Besides, it explicitly presents a mathematical equation of service rates and task refusal. The maximization problem is formulated and tackled by the proposed hybrid optimization algorithm called Genetic Simulated-annealing-based particle swarm optimization. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that larger profit are achieved than several existing scheduling algorithms.","authors":["Haitao Yuan","Jing Bi","Mengchu Zhou"],"meta":["October 2018IEEE Transactions on Services Computing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSC.2018.2878561"],"references":[]}
