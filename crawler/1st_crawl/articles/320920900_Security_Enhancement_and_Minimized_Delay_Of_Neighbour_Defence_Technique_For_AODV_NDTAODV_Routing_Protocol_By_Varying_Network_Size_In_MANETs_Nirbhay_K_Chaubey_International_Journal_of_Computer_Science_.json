In this scenario, designing an efficient and secure routing protocol has been a major challenge over the last many years. In this paper, we study impact of RREQ flood attack of our proposed Neighbour Defence Technique for AODV (NDTAODV) with the existing Secure Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (SAODV) and Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol by varying network size in MANETs with respect to four major performance metrics i.e. Packet Delivery Fraction (PDF), Average Throughput (AT), End-to-End Delay (AED) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL). Simulation results show that the NDTAODV gives better security and outperform the AODV in all performance metrics and also found nearly same result as that of SAODV with minimised AED and improved NRL without using any complex cryptography processing on the mobile node in MANETs.","authors":["Nirbhay Chaubey"],"meta":["November 2017","Project: Security in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment"],"references":["318343493_Wormhole_Attacks_and_Countermeasures_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","305308328_A_Study_of_Secure_Routing_in_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks","305307718_Routing_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network_A_Critical_Survey_and_Comparison","305307481_Performance_Analysis_of_TSDRP_and_AODV_Routing_Protocol_under_Black_Hole_Attacks_in_MANETs_by_Varying_Network_Size","305307474_Effect_of_Pause_Time_on_AODV_and_TSDRP_Routing_Protocols_Under_Black_Hole_Attack_and_DoS_Attacks_in_MANETs","303851106_Security_Analysis_of_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks_VANETs_A_Comprehensive_Study","310670788_Ad-hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","308856081_A_resilient_routing_approach_for_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","290570326_Security_for_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","271461588_Throughput_performance_analysis_of_the_wormhole_and_sybil_attack_in_AODV","260593719_Malicious_AODV_Implementation_and_Analysis_of_Routing_Attacks_in_MANETs","260409751_Trust_Based_Secure_on_Demand_Routing_Protocol_TSDRP_for_MANETs","260409417_NDTAODV_Neighbor_Defense_Technique_for_Ad_Hoc_On-Demand_Distance_Vector_AODV_to_Mitigate_Flood_Attack_in_Manets","259172514_Research_of_AODV_Routing_Protocol_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks1","261127021_Sybil_attack_defending_trusted_AODV_in_ad-hoc_netwok"]}
