{"id":"225228322_Machine_Learning_for_Information_Extraction_in_Informal_Domains","abstract":"We consider the problem of learning to perform information extraction in domains where linguistic processing is problematic, such as Usenet posts, email, and finger plan files. In place of syntactic and semantic information, other sources of information can be used, such as term frequency, typography, formatting, and mark-up. We describe four learning approaches to this problem, each drawn from a different paradigm: a rote learner, a term-space learner based on Naive Bayes, an approach using grammatical induction, and a relational rule learner. Experiments on 14 information extraction problems defined over four diverse document collections demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches. Finally, we describe a multistrategy approach which combines these learners and yields performance competitive with or better than the best of them. This technique is modular and flexible, and could find application in other machine learning problems.","authors":["Dayne Freitag"],"meta":["January 2000Machine Learning 39(2):169-202","DOI:10.1023/A:1007601113994","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["239570642_Representation_and_Learning_in_Information_Retrieval","220825580_NEC_description_of_the_VENIEX_system_as_used_for_MUC-5","220825570_BBN_description_of_the_PLUM_system_as_used_for_MUC-5","220825566_Hughes_Research_Laboratories_description_of_the_Trainable_Text_Skimmer_used_for_MUC-4","220813236_FASTUS_A_Finite-state_Processor_for_Information_Extraction_from_Real-world_Text","2711221_Experiments_on_Multistrategy_Learning_by_Meta-Learning","2637882_Using_Decision_Trees_for_Coreference_Resolution","2543721_Learning_Stochastic_Regular_Grammars_by_Means_of_a_State_Merging_Method","2508166_Automated_learning_of_decision_rules_for_text_categorization","2255536_The_Power_of_Decision_Tables","313046212_Beyond_independence_Conditions_for_the_optimality_of_the_simple_Bayesian_classifier","277289497_Learning_Text_Analysis_Rules_For_Domain-Specific_Natural_Language_Processing","262154819_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_Inference_of_Circuit-Free_Automata","248848344_Pattern_Classification_and_Scene_Analysis","242916838_Technical_Note_Selecting_a_Classification_Method_by_Cross-Validation","242506811_Machine_learning_A_multistrategy_approach","230876519_Proceedings_Fifth_Message_Understanding_Conference_MUC-5_Baltimore_MD","227332571_Grammatical_inference_An_introductory_survey","227166691_Unifying_Instance-Based_and_Rule-Based_Induction","222445347_Language_Identification_in_the_Limit","222445329_A_Theory_and_Methodology_of_Inductive_Learning","221605964_Automatically_Generating_Extraction_Patterns_from_Untagged_Text","221603479_Learning_to_Extract_Symbolic_Knowledge_from_the_World_Wide_Web","221523366_Grammatical_Inference_An_Introduction_Survey","220825602_BEN_description_of_the_PLUM_system_as_used_for_MUC-6","220825504_TRW_description_of_the_DEFT_system_as_used_for_MUC-5","220515917_Information_as_Basic_for_High-Precision_Text_Classification","220049445_An_Introduction_to_Hidden_Markov_Models","216721999_Pattern_Classification_and_Scene_Analysis","3296527_Acquisition_of_Linguistic_Patterns_for_Knowledge-Based_Information_Extraction","2833361_In_Proceedings_of_the_Seventh_Message_Understanding_Conference_MUC-7_1998","2809006_A_Scalable_Comparison-Shopping_Agent_for_the_World-Wide_Web","2702963_Learning_to_Extract_Text-based_Information_from_the_World_Wide_Web","2672195_A_Grammar_Inference_Algorithm_for_the_World_Wide_Web","2644110_Learning_to_Extract_Symbolic_Knowledge_from_the_World_Wide_Web","2475626_Nymble_High-Performance_Learning_Name-Finder","2456931_Wrapper_Induction_for_Information_Extraction","2428243_Beyond_Independence_Conditions_for_the_Optimality_of_the_Simple_Bayesian_Classifier","2370395_Empirical_Methods_in_Information_Extraction","1960997_Wrap-Up_a_Trainable_Discourse_Module_for_Information_Extraction"]}
