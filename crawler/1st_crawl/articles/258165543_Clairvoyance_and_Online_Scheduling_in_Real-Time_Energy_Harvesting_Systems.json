{"id":"258165543_Clairvoyance_and_Online_Scheduling_in_Real-Time_Energy_Harvesting_Systems","abstract":"Real-time energy harvesting systems are designed using a microprocessor, a rechargeable energy storage unit and an energy harvester. The theoretical analysis shows that an optimal solution to the underlying online scheduling problem requires time lookahead which can be incompatible with the common stochastic nature of ambient energy.","authors":["Maryline Chetto","Audrey Queudet"],"meta":["March 2014Real-Time Systems 50(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11241-013-9193-1"],"references":["264387596_Optimal_Scheduling_for_Real-Time_Jobs_in_Energy_Harvesting_Computing_Systems","220414195_Real-Time_Scheduling_for_Energy_Harvesting_Sensor_Nodes","220413965_Competitive_analysis_of_online_real-time_scheduling_algorithms_under_hard_energy_constraint","321621720_Energy_Harvesting_Technologies","283403347_Thin_Film_Batteries_for_Energy_Harvesting","278699818_Energy_Harvesting_Technologies","260946476_A_Note_on_EDF_Schedulingfor_Real-Time_Energy_Harvesting_Systems","221556716_Lookahead_Scheduling_in_a_Real-Time_Context","220431427_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multiprogramming_in_Hard-Real-Time_Environment"]}
