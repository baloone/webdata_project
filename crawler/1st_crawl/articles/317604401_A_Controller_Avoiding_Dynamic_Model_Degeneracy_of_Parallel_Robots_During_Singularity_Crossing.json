{"id":"317604401_A_Controller_Avoiding_Dynamic_Model_Degeneracy_of_Parallel_Robots_During_Singularity_Crossing","abstract":"Parallel robots present singular configurations that divide the operational workspace into several aspects. It was proven that type 2 and leg passive joint twist system (LPJTS) singularities can be crossed with a trajectory respecting a given dynamic criterion. However, the practical implementation of a controller able to track such trajectories is up to now limited to restrictive cases of type 2 singularities crossing. Analyzing the structure of the inverse dynamic model, this paper proposes a global solution allowing the tracking of trajectories respecting the general criterion for any singularity that leads to potential issues of dynamic model degeneracy. The tracking is operated in the robot joint space. Experimental results on a five-bar mechanism showed the controller ability to successfully cross type 2 singularities.","authors":["SÃ©bastien Briot","Six Damien","Abdelhamid Chriette","Philippe Martinet"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics 9(5)","DOI:10.1115/1.4037256"],"references":["282298349_Degeneracy_Conditions_of_the_Dynamic_Model_of_Parallel_Robots","277680797_On_the_Dynamic_Properties_of_Rigid-Link_Flexible-Joint_Parallel_Manipulators_in_the_Presence_of_Type_2_Singularities","268196577_A_vision-based_generic_dynamic_model_of_PKMs_and_its_experimental_validation_on_the_Quattro_parallel_robot","258819938_Development_of_a_Five-Bar_Parallel_Robot_With_Large_Workspace","224669056_Singularity_Analysis_of_Mechanisms_and_Robots_via_a_Velocity-Equation_Model_of_the_Instantaneous_Kinematics","220122786_Solving_the_Forward_Kinematics_of_a_Gough-Type_Parallel_Manipulator_with_Interval_Analysis","220122633_A_Review_on_the_Dynamic_Control_of_Parallel_Kinematic_Machines_Theory_and_Experiments","3955283_Constraint_singularities_of_parallel_mechanisms","3298319_Multiple-goal_kinematic_optimization_of_a_parallel_spherical_mechanism_with_actuator_redundancy","3298042_Singularity_Analysis_of_Closed-Loop_Kinematic_Chains","316799236_Structural_Synthesis_of_Parallel_Robots","311923826_Dynamics_of_Parallel_Robots","278687591_New_Trends_in_Mechanism_Science","273057265_Enlarging_Parallel_Robot_Workspace_through_Type-2_Singularity_Crossing","245126437_Inverse_dynamics_of_parallel_manipulators_in_the_presence_of_drive_singularities","229464566_Robust_control_of_a_class_of_non-linear_systems_and_applications_to_robotics","228355726_Increase_of_Singularity-Free_Zones_in_the_Workspace_of_Parallel_Manipulators_Using_Mechanisms_of_Variable_Structure","224459781_A_New_Assessment_of_Singularities_of_Parallel_Kinematic_Chains","223493465_Kinematics_singularity_and_workspace_of_planar_5R_symmetrical_parallel_mechanisms","223304711_Kinematic_and_Dynamic_Identification_of_Parallel_Mechanisms","222823600_Non-Singular_Assembly-mode_Changing_Motions_for_3-RPR_Parallel_Manipulators","222262976_Structural_synthesis_of_fully-isotropic_translational_parallel_robots_via_theory_of_linear_transformations","221070900_Identification_of_the_Dynamic_Parameters_of_a_Closed_Loop_Robot","220122746_Optimal_Force_Generation_of_Parallel_Manipulators_for_Passing_through_the_Singular_Positions","3500486_Force_optimization_in_redundantly-actuated_closed_kinematic_chains"]}
