{"id":"324899456_Effects_of_workload_on_teachers'_functioning_A_moderated_mediation_model_including_sleeping_problems_and_overcommitment","abstract":"This study investigated the mediating role of sleeping problems in the relationship between workload and outcomes (emotional exhaustion, presenteeism, job satisfaction, and performance), and overcommitment was examined as a moderator in the relationship between workload and sleeping problems. We conducted an empirical study using a sample of 884 teachers. Consistent with our predictions, results revealed that the positive indirect effects of workload on emotional exhaustion and presenteeism, and the negative indirect effects of workload on job satisfaction and performance, through sleeping problems, were only significant among overcommitted teachers. Workload and overcommitment were also directly related to all four outcomes, precisely, they both positively related to emotional exhaustion and presenteeism and negatively related to job satisfaction and performance. Theoretical contributions and perspectives and implications for practice are discussed.","authors":["Tiphaine Huyghebaert-Zouaghi","Nicolas Gillet","Nicolas Beltou","Fanny Tellier"],"meta":["June
