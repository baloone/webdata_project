{"id":"340285458_Effect_of_a_short_rest_period_on_associative_and_relational_memory_performance_A_Virtual_Reality_study","abstract":"Virtual reality immerses individuals in 3D environments where spatial properties are similar to those of real life. Virtual reality can therefore be effective and relevant in the study of memory processing, especially when spatial properties are involved. We studied the effect of a 20-minute rest period on memory performance for associative and relational learnings. Eighty-one participants were placed in a virtual environment in which they learned 24 associations implicating objects and their respective precise location. As expected, the performance of associative memory was improved by a rest period between study and test phases. We discuss these results and the benefits of using an immersive virtual environment for such memory investigation. In addition, elaborating our environment was highly informative and led to several recommendations that we believe could be useful for researchers who would like to rely on virtual reality for investigating memory.","authors":["Nicolas Ribeiro","Camille Sagnier","VÃ©ronique Quaglino","Yannick Gounden"],"meta":["March 2020","DOI:10.20870/IJVR.2020.20.1.3186"],"references":["335478166_Overnight_sleep_benefits_both_neutral_and_negative_direct_associative_and_relational_memory","326916310_Dreaming_of_a_learning_task_is_associated_with_enhanced_memory_consolidation_Replication_in_an_overnight_sleep_study","313784279_Virtual_reality_assisted_microscopy_data_visualization_and_colocalization_analysis","308663096_The_differential_effects_of_emotional_salience_on_direct_associative_and_relational_memory_during_a_nap","333835515_Scenes_facilitate_associative_memory_and_integration","332771841_Virtual_reality_in_episodic_memory_research_A_review","326773215_Helping_older_pedestrians_navigate_unknown_environments_through_vibrotactile_guidance_instructions","325276452_Immersion_and_the_illusion_of_presence_in_virtual_reality","320140142_Sleep_on_your_memory_traces_How_sleep_effects_can_be_explained_by_Act-In_a_functional_memory_model","283436208_Simulator_Sickness_and_the_Oculus_Rift_A_First_Look"]}
