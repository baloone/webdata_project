We develop here a new method to study the stability of such a system, coupling ordinary and partial differential equations, using linear matrix inequalities led by the choice of an appropriate Lyapunov functional. To this end, we exploit Legendre polynomials and their properties, and use a Bessel inequality to measure the contribution of our approximation. The exponential stability of a wide class of delay systems is a direct consequence of this study, but above all, we are detailing here a new approach in the consideration of systems coupling infinite and finite dimensional dynamics. The coupling with a vectorial transport equation is a first step that already prove the interest of the method, bringing hierarchized conditions for stability. We will give exponential stability results and their proofs. Our approach will finally be tested on several academic examples.","authors":["Mohammed Safi","Lucie Baudouin","Alexandre Seuret"],"meta":["December 2017Systems & Control Letters 110:1-8","DOI:10.1016/j.sysconle.2017.09.003"],"references":["314626937_Dynamic_Boundary_Stabilization_of_First_Order_Hyperbolic_Systems","311830959_Stability_and_Stabilization_of_Infinite_Dimensional_Systems_with_Applications","304410805_Stability_analysis_of_a_singularly_perturbed_coupled_ODE-PDE_system","324692210_Delay_compensation_for_nonlinear_adaptive_and_PDE_Systems","324261962_Introduction_to_time-delay_systems_Analysis_and_control","313504316_Stability_and_Boundary_Stabilization_of_1-D_Hyperbolic_Systems","312456261_Control_of_homodirectional_and_general_heterodirectional_linear_coupled_hyperbolic_PDEs","306262805_Multiple_integral_inequalities_and_stability_analysis_of_time_delay_systems","288070539_A_New_Necessary_and_Sufficient_Stability_Condition_for_Linear_Time-Delay_Systems","278176294_Stabilization_of_a_System_of_Coupled_First-Order_Hyperbolic_Linear_PDEs_With_a_Single_Boundary_Input"]}
