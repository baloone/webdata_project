{"id":"220472915_Vehicle_routing_with_full_loads","abstract":"This paper considers a vehicle routing problem with full loads and time limit constraints. This problem can be formulated as an asymmetrical travelling salesman problem with two types of restrictions. When these restrictions are not too stringent, the problem can be solved optimally for relatively large sizes.","authors":["Jacques Desrosiers","Gilbert Laporte","Michel Sauve","Fran√ßois Soumis"],"meta":["December 1988Computers & Operations Research 15(3):219-226","DOI:10.1016/0305-0548(88)90034-2","SourceDBLP"],"references":["256523530_A_branch-and-bound_algorithm_for_the_asymmetrical_distance-constrained_vehicle_routing_problem","247644551_Planning_for_Truck_Fleet_Size_in_the_Presence_of_a_Common-Carrier_Option","247590142_Some_Simple_Applications_of_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","236035119_Routing_and_Scheduling_of_Vehicles_and_Crews_The_State_of_the_Art","229590888_Routing_with_time_windows_by_column_generation","227445047_Some_New_Branching_and_Bounding_Criteria_for_the_Asymmetric_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","222863485_Vehicle_routing_via_column_generation","220470681_Routing_and_scheduling_of_vehicles_and_crews_The_state_of_the_art"]}
