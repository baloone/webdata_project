{"id":"311465314_The_ethnographically_informed_participatory_design_of_a_PD_application_to_support_communication","abstract":"Aphasia is an acquired communication deficit that impacts the different language modalities. PDAs have a form factor and feature set that suggest they could be effective communication tools for people with aphasia. An ethnographic study was conducted with one participant both to learn about communication strategies used by people with aphasia, and to observe how a PDA is incorporated into those strategies. The most significant usability issues found were file access and organization. A participatory design phase followed, resulting in a paper prototype of a file management system that addressed the key usability issues identified. The participatory approach continued during the implementation of a high-fidelity prototype.","authors":["Rhian Davies","Skip Marcella","Joanna Mcgrenere","Barbara Purves"],"meta":["September 2003ACM SIGACCESS Accessibility and Computing","DOI:10.1145/1029014.1028658"],"references":["238680061_Introduction_to_language_intervention_strategies_in_adult_aphasia","232504206_Consumer_participation_in_disability_research_The_golden_rule_as_a_guide_for_ethical_practice","221515265_The_participatory_design_of_a_sound_and_image_enhanced_daily_planner_for_people_with_Aphasia","6988286_Some_values_guiding_community_research_and_action","300256416_Prelims_-_Whose_Reality_Counts","239007295_Emerging_technologies_in_augmentative_and_alternative_communication_Restorative_and_compensatory_approaches_to_acquired_disorders_of_communication","221652332_Assistive_social_interaction_for_non-speaking_people_living_in_the_community","220961461_A_Scandinavian_challenge_a_US_response_Methodological_assumptions_in_Scandinavian_and_US_prototyping_approaches","220728989_From_workplace_to_development_what_have_we_learned_so_far_and_where_do_we_go","215439945_Making_Work_Visible","19432208_Building_the_foundations_for_sentence_production_in_a_non-fluent_aphasic","14268491_Crossed_Aphasia_and_Related_Anomalies_of_Cerebral_Organization_Case_Reports_and_a_Genetic_Hypothesis","13612250_Evaluating_the_use_of_TalksBac_a_predictive_communication_device_for_nonfluent_adults_with_aphasia","2288152_Moving_Out_From_the_Control_Room_Ethnography_in_System_Design"]}
