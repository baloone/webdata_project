{"id":"277656485_Using_Blogs_to_Create_a_Constructivist_Learning_Environment","abstract":"Educational environments that support constructivism are particularly beneficial to student learning. They increase motivation and information retention by actively engaging learners in the development of their understanding. E-learning technologies, specifically social networking websites, are effective tools for creating constructivist educational environments. Blogs are especially valuable platforms for constructivist learning and can be tailored to support a wide range of educational concepts and activities. This paper will present the findings of an analysis on the impact of blogs on constructivist education. It will then discuss the implications of these results in terms of teaching, followed by pedagogical recommendations.","authors":["Lindsay Noel"],"meta":["February 2015Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 174:617-621","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.591"],"references":["284969113_A_comparative_study_of_using_blogs_and_wikis_for_collaborative_knowledge_construction","236694410_Developing_Students_As_Global_Learners_Groups_in_Our_World_Blog","228616142_Pedagogy_in_Cyberspace_The_Dynamics_of_Online_Discourse","226927644_History_and_philosophy_in_science_teaching","222474115_Critical_Inquiry_in_a_Text-Based_Environment_Computer_Conferencing_in_Higher_Education","227837043_An_empirically_grounded_framework_to_guide_blogging_in_higher_education","223892893_To_blog_or_not_to_blog_Student_perceptions_of_blog_effectiveness_for_learning_in_a_college-level_course","222824173_Social_software_as_support_in_hybrid_learning_environments_The_value_of_the_blog_as_a_tool_for_reflective_learning_and_peer_support","222574001_Weblog_success_Exploring_the_role_of_technology","222409922_The_Phenomenon_of_Blogs_and_Theoretical_Model_of_Blog_Use_in_Educational_Contexts"]}
