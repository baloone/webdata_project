{"id":"242391624_Detection_of_Surface-Specific_Points_by_Local_Parallel_Processing_of_Discrete_Terrain_Elevation_Data","abstract":"This paper describes several methods designed to detect pits, peaks, passes, ridges, ravines, and breaks, given an array of sampled, quantized terrain elevations. The methods all use local analysis of the data; they are “parallel” in the sense that the results at each point do not depend on the results already obtained at other points.","authors":["Thomas K.
