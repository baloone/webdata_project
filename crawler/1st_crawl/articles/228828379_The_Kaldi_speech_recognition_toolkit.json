{"id":"228828379_The_Kaldi_speech_recognition_toolkit","abstract":"We describe the design of Kaldi, a free, open-source toolkit for speech recognition research. Kaldi provides a speech recognition system based on finite-state transducers (using the freely available OpenFst), together with detailed documentation and scripts for building complete recognition systems. Kaldi is written is C++, and the core library supports modeling of arbitrary phonetic-context sizes, acoustic modeling with subspace Gaussian mixture models (SGMM) as well as standard Gaussian mixture models, together with all commonly used linear and affine transforms. Kaldi is released under the Apache License v2.0, which is highly nonrestrictive, making it suitable for a wide community of users.","authors":["Daniel Povey","Arnab Ghoshal","Gilles Boulianne","Lukáš Burget"],"meta":["January 2011","Project: Speech Recognition"],"references":["228770826_Sphinx-4_A_flexible_open_source_framework_for_speech_recognition","221491386_Using_VTLN_for_broadcast_news_transcription","221490881_The_RWTH_Aachen_University_open_source_speech_recognition_system","221490493_Julius-An_open_source_real-time_large_vocabulary_recognition_engine","257267653_Maximum_likelihood_linear_transformations_for_HMM-based_speech_recognition","243774218_Maximum_likelihood_linear_regression_speaker_adaptation_of_continuous_density_HMMs","229078317_Maximum_likelihood_linear_regression_for_speaker_adaptation_of_continuous_density_hidden_Markov_models","222577940_The_subspace_Gaussian_mixture_model-A_structured_model_for_speech_recognition","222397975_Weighted_Finite-State_Transducers_in_Speech_Recognition","221568098_OpenFst_A_General_and_Efficient_Weighted_Finite-State_Transducer_Library","3793962_Frame_discrimination_training_of_HMMs_for_large_vocabulary_speech_recognition","3601041_Large_vocabulary_continues_speech_recognition_using_HTK","3333724_Robust_Decision_Tree_State_Tying_for_Continuous_Speech_Recognition","3333632_Semi-Tied_Full-Covariance_Matrices_For_Hidden_Markov_Models","2374395_Maximum_Likelihood_Modeling_With_Gaussian_Distributions_For_Classification"]}
