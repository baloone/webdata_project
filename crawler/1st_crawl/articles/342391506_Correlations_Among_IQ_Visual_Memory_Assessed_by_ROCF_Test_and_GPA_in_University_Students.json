{"id":"342391506_Correlations_Among_IQ_Visual_Memory_Assessed_by_ROCF_Test_and_GPA_in_University_Students","abstract":"Introduction: It is well known that cognitive ability tests predict academic performance. This study was conducted to\nreinvestigate the effects of IQ assessed by Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test and Immediate recall (short-term visual memory)\nand Delayed recall (long-term visual memory) subtests of the ROCF on GPA in university students.\nMethods: A total of 125 Nigerian university students were involved in the study. Participants were 63 men and 62 women\nwho were 16-18 years of age. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test developed by Rey and standardized by\nOsterrieth used to screen for visual memory. To get their full-scale IQ scores were used the Wonderlic Personnel Test\nQuicktest.\nResults: There were a strong positive correlation between GPA and IQ and short-term and long-term visual memories in\ntotal sample as well as men and women. GPA was not correlated with IQ in medicine students. But short-term and long-term\nvisual memories were highly correlated with GPA.\nConclusion: Because visual memory tests are culture and language free international tests, the universities can use visual\nmemory tests firstly and IQ tests secondarily to predict their academic performance.","authors":["Ochilbek Rakhmanov","Senol Dane"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Research in Medical and Dental Science 8(3):1-5","Project: Research on effects of Cognitive Drawing tests on students academic and psychological conditions"],"references":["339750765_The_Relationships_among_Gender_Handedness_GPA_Depression_and_Visual_Memory_in_the_ROCF_Test_in_University_Students","338646166_Correlation_between_Vanderbilt_ADHD_Diagnostic_Scale_and_the_Draw-a-Man_Test_in_School_Children","271805991_Working_Smarter_and_Harder_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Managerial_Success","237822262_The_Power_of_Personality_The_Comparative_Validity_of_Personality_Traits_Socioeconomic_Status_and_Cognitive_Ability_for_Predicting_Important_Life_Outcomes","232794307_Clinial_and_empirical_applications_of_the_Rey-Oserrieth_Complex_Figure_Test","232596839_Tacit_Knowledge_Practical_Intelligence_General_Mental_Ability_and_Job_Knowledge","320882699_Can_visuospatial_measures_improve_the_diagnosis_of_Alzheimer's_disease","306535703_Translations_of_excerpts_from_Andre_Rey's_psychological_examination_of_traumatic_encephalopathy_and_PA_Osterrieth's_the_complex_figure_copy_test","275714105_Wonderlic_Personnel_Test_Manual","233463405_Rey_Complex_Figure_Test_under_four_different_administration_procedures"]}
