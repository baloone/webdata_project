{"id":"228395101_Multipartite_Moore_digraphs","abstract":"We derive some Moore-like bounds for multipartite digraphs, which extend those of bipartite digraphs, under the assumption that every vertex of a given partite set is adjacent to the same number δ of vertices in each of the other independent sets. We determine when a Moore multipartite digraph is weakly distance-regular. Within this framework, some necessary conditions for the existence of a Moore r-partite digraph with interpartite outdegree δ > 1 and diameter k = 2m are obtained. In the case δ = 1, which corresponds to almost Moore digraphs, a necessary condition in terms of the permutation cycle structure is derived. Additionally, we present some constructions of dense multipartite digraphs of diameter two that are vertex-transitive.","authors":["Miquel Angel Fiol","Joan Gimbert","M Miller"],"meta":["November 2006Linear Algebra and its Applications 419(1):234-250","DOI:10.1016/j.laa.2006.04.020"],"references":["243041688_On_the_weak_distance-regularity_of_Moore-type_digraphs","234763318_Line_digraph_iterations_and_the_dk_problem_for_directed_graphs","220397918_On_the_Structure_of_Digraphs_with_Order_Close_to_the_Moore_Bound","3048431_Line_Digraph_Iterations_and_the_d_k_Digraph_Problem","2734050_Digraphs_of_degree_3_and_order_close_to_the_Moore_bound","285021905_Regular_digraphs_of_diameter_2_and_maximum_order","266520899_Partially_directed_Moore_graphs","265325790_Strongly_geodetic_directed_graphs","256693848_Algebraic_characterizations_of_distance-regular_graphs","248390194_Graphs_Digraphs","245241899_Algebraic_Combinatorics_Chapman_and_Hall","235263347_Boundary_graphs_The_limit_case_of_a_spectral_property","229872135_On_Moore_bipartite_digraphs","229484187_Dense_bipartite_digraphs","229250589_Enumeration_of_almost_Moore_digraphs_of_diameter_two","227754348_Digraphs_of_degree_3_and_order_close_to_Moore_bound","226142940_On_the_linegraph_of_a_directed_graph","222862556_On_mixed_Moore_graphs","222515983_Weakly_distance-regular_digraphs","222291796_A_directed_graph_version_of_strongly_regular_graphs","220692867_Algebraic_Combinatorics","220190753_On_the_existence_of_dk-digraphs","220188073_Almost_Moore_digraphs_are_diregular","220076574_On_the_impossibility_of_Directed_Moore_Graphs"]}
