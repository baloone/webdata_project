{"id":"316581111_Equations_for_the_Calculation_of_Gravity_Segregation_in_Killed_Steel","abstract":"A mathematical model based on the partial differential equations for heat and mass transport in the different zones of a solidifying ingot is presented. For calculation of carbon segregation, the original equations were simplified by assuming the horizontal velocity components to be zero. The results of calculations are compared with experimentally determined carbon segregation in a 4 t ingot.","authors":["Yun-Ken Chuang","Klaus Schwerdtfeger"],"meta":["May 1975"],"references":[]}
