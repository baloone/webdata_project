{"id":"344154633_Using_Design_Patterns_to_Support_E-Learning_Design","abstract":"Design patterns have received considerable attention for their potential as a means of capturing and sharing design knowledge. This chapter provides a review of design pattern research and usage within education and other disciplines, summarizes the reported benefits of the approach, and examines design patterns in relation to other approaches to supporting design. Building upon this work, it argues that design patterns can capture learning design knowledge from theories and best practices to support novices in effective e-learning design. This chapter describes the authorsâ€™ work on the development of designs patterns for e-learning. It concludes with a discussion of future research for educational uses of design patterns.","authors":["Information Resources Management Association","Sherri S.
