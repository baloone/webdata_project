{"id":"329738779_On_the_control_of_a_cooperatively_robotic_system_by_using_hibrid_logic_algorithms","abstract":"A hybrid logic algorithm is presented for extending the control of a cooperatively robotic system by including uncertain input conditions and the hard and soft stops. The method can be used in surgical interventions where the robot and the physician are working with the same surgical tool. The results show that the algorithm improves the trajectory tracking performance and preventing the surgeon-tool r to cross the critical boundaries and to move towards undesirable directions.","authors":["Veturia Chiroiu","L.
