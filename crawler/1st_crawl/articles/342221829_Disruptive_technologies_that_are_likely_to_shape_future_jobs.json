{"id":"342221829_Disruptive_technologies_that_are_likely_to_shape_future_jobs","abstract":"The motivation for this article is to understand future job requirements in the field of computer science and related fields. It is obvious that emerging technologies will necessitate new skills and roles. Technology powers the economy, allows businesses to prosper and creates jobs. In earlier years, the focus of the IT industry was primarily on programming. Strong programming skills are still needed but industries wish to select students skilled in technologies when they recruit them from institutions imparting engineering education. It is necessary to understand which disruptive technologies in fields related to computer science and engineering are going to shape future jobs.","authors":["S.V.
