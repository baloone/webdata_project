{"id":"285108978_Mechanical_properties_of_two_kinds_of_new_cold-formed_flange-closed_welded_section_members","abstract":"The hollow flange beam (HFB) is a particular cross section with two torsion rigid closed triangular flanges and a comparatively flexible web, and it is a type of high efficient cross section. This paper presents two kinds of new cold-formed flange-closed welded sections named HF1 and HF2 through change the section component and parameters of HFB. Based on the precise finite element model, nonlinear finite element method is adopted to study the static behaviors including buckling modes, deformed process, load carrying capacity and stiffness of two new kinds of section members under axial compression, bend and component axial compression-bend loads. The two new kinds of section members have some superior static behaviors including higher mean section stress and modulus of the member and have no local buckling phenomena in the elements are proofed under axial compression, and have the well characteristic of high rigidity, high ultimate capacity, local buckling of the sections always hard to occur and correlation curves replete under bend and component axial compression-bend loads, too. The new cold-formed flange-closed welded section members can go deep into the experiment study as to be used in the practical engineering.","authors":["S. Wu","H. Zhang","W.
