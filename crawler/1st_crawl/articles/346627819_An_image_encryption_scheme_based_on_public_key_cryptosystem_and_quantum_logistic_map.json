{"id":"346627819_An_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_public_key_cryptosystem_and_quantum_logistic_map","abstract":"Most of existing image encryption schemes are proposed in the spatial domain which easily destroys the correlation between pixels. This paper proposes an image encryption scheme by employing discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantum logistic map and substitution-permutation network (SPN). The DCT is used to transform the images in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, the SPN is used to provide the security properties of confusion and diffusion. The SPN provides fast encryption as compared to the asymmetric based image encryption since operations with low computational complexity are used (e.g., exclusive-or and permutation). Different statistical experiments and security analysis are performed against six grayscale and color images to justify the effectiveness and security of the proposed image encryption scheme.","authors":["Guodong Ye","Kaixin Jiao","Xiaoling Huang","Bok-Min Goi"],"meta":["December 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-78127-2"],"references":["344438778_A_novel_chaotic_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_improved_baker_map_and_logistic_map","342369517_Image_encryption_using_quantum_3-D_Baker_map_and_generalized_gray_code_coupled_with_fractional_Chen's_chaotic_system","342104296_A_novel_hybrid_encryption_scheme_based_on_chaotic_Lorenz_system_and_logarithmic_key_generation","341474888_Circuit_implementation_of_3D_chaotic_self-exciting_single-disk_homopolar_dynamo_and_its_application_in_digital_image_confidentiality","339538800_An_Encryption_Scheme_Based_on_Discrete_Quantum_Map_and_Continuous_Chaotic_System","345441515_Double-image_encryption_based_on_interference_and_logistic_map_under_the_framework_of_double_random_phase_encoding","345386372_Coupling_chaotic_system_based_on_unit_transform_and_its_applications_in_image_encryption","341957673_Color_image_compression_and_encryption_scheme_based_on_compressive_sensing_and_double_random_encryption_strategy","341439527_An_efficient_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_chaotic_and_Deoxyribonucleic_acid_sequencing","341082057_A_new_color_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_2DNLCML_system_and_genetic_operations"]}
