{"id":"221437145_Influencing_users_towards_better_passwords_Persuasive_cued_click-points","abstract":"Usable security has unique usability challenges bec ause the need for security often means that standard human-computer-interaction approaches cannot be directly applied. An important usability goal for authentication systems is to support users in s electing better passwords, thus increasing security by expanding th e effective password space. In click-based graphical passwords, poorly chosen passwords lead to the emergence of hotspots - portions of the image where users are more likely to select cli ck-points, allowing attackers to mount more successful diction ary attacks. We use persuasion to influence user choice in click -based graphical passwords, encouraging users to select mo re random, and hence more secure, click-points. Our approach i s to introduce persuasion to the Cued Click-Points graphical passw ord scheme (Chiasson, van Oorschot, Biddle, 2007) . Our resulting scheme significantly reduces hotspots while still maintain ing its usability.","authors":["Sonia Chiasson","Alain Forget","Robert Biddle","Paul C. van Oorschot"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1145/1531514.1531531","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 22nd British HCI Group Annual Conference on HCI 2008: People and Computers XXII: Culture, Creativity, Interaction - Volume 1, BCS HCI 2008, Liverpool, United Kingdom, 1-5 September 2008"],"references":["228623557_Persuasion_as_education_for_computer_security","238312578_Security_and_Usability_Designing_Systems_that_People_Can_Use","236734699_The_Statistical_Analysis_of_Spatial_Point_Patterns","234815085_Human-seeded_attacks_and_exploiting_hot-spots_in_graphical_passwords","232129036_A_nonparametric_measure_of_spatial_interaction_in_point_patterns","230877240_Persuasive_Technology_Using_Computers_to_Change_What_We_Think_and_Do","228622723_A_usability_study_and_critique_of_two_password_managers","225572775_Click_Passwords_Under_Investigation","225193580_Graphical_Password_Authentication_Using_Cued_Click_Points","223526631_PassPoints_Design_and_longitudinal_evaluation_of_a_graphical_password_system","223201064_The_usability_of_passphrases_for_authentication_An_empirical_field_study","222678553_De_Angeli_A_My_password_is_here_An_investigation_into_visuo-spatial_authentication_mechanisms_Interacting_with_Computers_16_1017-1041","221519334_Memorability_of_persuasive_passwords","221342221_Towards_understanding_user_perceptions_of_authentication_technologies","221166487_A_second_look_at_the_usability_of_click-based_graphical_passwords"]}
