{"id":"235632744_Quantitative_Approaches_to_Comparing_Communication_Patterns_on_Twitter","abstract":"To date, the available literature mainly discusses Twitter activity patterns in the context of individual case studies, while comparative research on a large number of communicative events and their dynamics and patterns is missing. By conducting a comparative study of more than 40 different cases (covering topics such as elections, natural disasters, corporate crises, and televised events) we identify a number of distinct types of discussion that can be observed on Twitter. Drawing on a range of communicative metrics, we show that thematic and contextual factors influence the usage of different communicative tools available to Twitter users, such as original tweets, @replies, retweets, and URLs. Based on this first analysis of the overall metrics of Twitter discussions, we also demonstrate stable patterns in the use of Twitter in the context of major topics and events.","authors":["Axel Bruns","Stefan Stieglitz"],"meta":["July 2012Journal of Technology in Human Services 30(3-4):160-185","DOI:10.1080/15228835.2012.744249"],"references":["324569779_Twittering_on_Audience_research_and_participation_using_Twitter","309906984_Political_polarization_on_Twitter","306158429_Social_media_and_political_communication_a_social_media_analytics_framework","288792588_Analysis_of_sentiments_in_corporate_Twitter_communication_-_A_case_study_on_an_issue_of_Toyota","276974105_Konferenz-Tweets_Ein_Ansatz_zur_Analyse_der_Twitter-Kommunikation_bei_wissenschaftlichen_Konferenzen","261995833_Managing_Bad_News_in_Social_Media_A_Case_Study_on_Domino's_Pizza_Crisis","259704042_Emotions_and_Information_Diffusion_in_Social_Media_-_Sentiment_of_Microblogs_and_Sharing_Behavior","258173852_Studying_Political_Microblogging_Twitter_Users_in_the_2010_Swedish_Election_Campaign","258127257_Dynamic_Debates_An_Analysis_of_Group_Polarization_Over_Time_on_Twitter","254296668_Critical_Questions_for_Big_Data","242335067_Brand_Communication_in_Twitter_-_a_Case_Study_on_Adidas","235632721_Social_Media_and_Political_Communication_-_A_Social_Media_Analytics_Framework","235616529_I_Tweet_Honestly_I_Tweet_Passionately_Twitter_Users_Context_Collapse_and_the_Imagined_Audience","235354320_The_Revolutions_Were_Tweeted_Information_Flows_During_the_2011_Tunisian_and_Egyptian_Revolutions","234139130_Twitter_Under_Crisis_Can_we_trust_what_we_RT","232637969_Political_Communication_and_Influence_through_Microblogging_-_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Sentiment_in_Twitter_Messages_and_Retweet_Behavior","228405783_Citation_analysis_in_Twitter_Approaches_for_defining_and_measuring_information_flows_within_tweets_during_scientific_conferences","224123112_Tweet_Tweet_Retweet_Conversational_Aspects_of_Retweeting_on_Twitter","221297916_Political_Polarization_on_Twitter","221229634_Social_Media_Data_Mining_A_Social_Network_Analysis_Of_Tweets_During_The_2010-2011_Australian_Floods","221180865_Motivating_Content_Contributions_to_Online_Communities_Toward_a_More_Comprehensive_Theory","215500880_Twitter_Adoption_and_Use_in_Mass_Convergence_and_Emergency_Events","322925582_An_Information_Diffusion-Based_Recommendation_Framework_for_Micro-Blogging","279406848_Tools_and_methods_for_capturing_Twitter_data_during_natural_disasters","277855418_Ad_hoc_innovation_by_users_of_social_networks_the_case_of_Twitter","277744991_Ausvotes_How_twitter_covered_the_2010_Australian_federal_election","267922122_A_networked_self_Identity_community_and_culture_on_social_network_sites","263566272_Conclusion_A_Networked_Self","259251044_qldfloods_and_QPSMedia_Crisis_Communication_on_Twitter_in_the_2011_South_East_Queensland_Floods","258122779_The_Arab_Spring_and_Social_Media_Audiences_English_and_Arabic_Twitter_Users_and_Their_Networks","239787962_Twitter_Revolutions_Addressing_Social_Media_and_Dissent","237903220_Audiencing_A_Cultural_Studies_Approach_to_Watching_Television","234810393_A_few_chirps_about_Twitter","230531536_Twitter-based_information_distribution_during_the_2009_Red_River_Valley_flood_threat","220876159_Want_to_be_Retweeted_Large_Scale_Analytics_on_Factors_Impacting_Retweet_in_Twitter_Network","220580453_A_Novel_Recommendation_Framework_for_Micro-Blogging_Based_on_Information_Diffusion","215776051_Election_Forecasts_With_Twitter","27469211_Gatewatching_Collaborative_Online_News_Production"]}
