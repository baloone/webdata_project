{"id":"230846941_Concrete_and_Other_Neo-Piagetian_Forms_of_Reasoning_in_the_Novice_Programmer","abstract":"This paper brings together a number of empirical research results on novice programmers, using a neo-Piagetian theoretical framework. While there already exists literature connecting programming with classical Piagetian theory, in this paper we apply neo-Piagetian theory. Using that neo-Piagetian perspective, we offer an explanation as to why attempts to predict ability for programming via classical Piagetian tests have yielded mixed results. We offer a neo-Piagetian explanation of some of the previously puzzling observations about novice programmers, such as why many of them make little use of diagrams, and why they often manifest a non-systematic approach to writing programs. We also develop the relatively unexplored relationship between concrete operational reasoning and programming, by exploring concepts such as conservation and reversibility.","authors":["Raymond Lister"],"meta":["January 2011","Conference: Australasian Computing Education ConferenceVolume: 13"],"references":["264549863_Cognitive_Development_Neo-Piagetian_Perspectives","258944205_The_Initial_Knowledge_State_of_College_Physics_Students","235671568_Early_Relational_Reasoning_and_the_Novice_Programmer_Swapping_as_the_Hello_World_of_Relational_Reasoning","234800767_A_Multi-National_Study_of_Reading_and_Tracing_Skills_in_Novice_Programmers","230751881_Relationships_between_reading_tracing_and_writing_skills_in_introductory_programming","228900648_The_neglected_middle_novice_programmer_reading_and_writing_without_abstracting","270133817_Cognitive_Development","242555485_Formal_Operations_and_Learning_Style_Predict_Success_in_Statistics_and_Computer_Science_Courses","234810721_Investigating_the_relationship_between_the_development_of_abstract_reasoning_and_performance_in_an_introductory_programming_class","234745086_Piagetian_Formal_Operations_and_Other_Cognitive_Correlates_of_Achievement_in_Computer_Programming"]}
