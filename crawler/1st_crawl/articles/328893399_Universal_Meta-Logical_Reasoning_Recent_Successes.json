{"id":"328893399_Universal_Meta-Logical_Reasoning_Recent_Successes","abstract":"Classical higher-order logic, when utilized as a meta-logic in which various other (classical and non-classical) logics can be shallowly embedded, is suitable as a foundation for the development of a universal logical reasoning engine. Such an engine may be employed, as already envisioned by Leibniz, to support the rigorous formalisation and deep logical analysis of rational arguments on the computer. A respective universal logical reasoning framework is described in this article and a range of successful first applications in philosophy, artificial intelligence and mathematics are surveyed.","authors":["Christoph Benzm√ºller"],"meta":["March 2019Science of Computer Programming 172:48-62","DOI:10.1016/j.scico.2018.10.008","Project: Studies in Computational Metaphysics"],"references":["326194947_A_Deontic_Logic_Reasoning_Infrastructure","324387784_First_Experiments_with_a_Flexible_Infrastructure_for_Normative_Reasoning","324055533_IO_Logic_in_HOL_---_First_Steps","323392435_Faithful_Semantical_Embedding_of_a_Dyadic_Deontic_Logic_in_HOL","323026923_The_Higher-Order_Prover_Leo-III","321160582_Mechanizing_Principia_Logico-Metaphysica_in_Functional_Type_Theory","319395005_Proof_Development_in_OMEGA_The_Irrationality_of_Square_Root_of_2","320818523_Magari_and_others_on_Godel's_ontological_proof","319394252_Introduction_to_Higher-Order_Categorical_Logic","319393460_Begriffsschrift_eine_der_arithmetischen_nachgebildete_Formelsprache_des_reinen_Denkens","318036219_Automating_Emendations_of_the_Ontological_Argument_in_Intensional_Higher-Order_Modal_Logic","317956529_Types_Tableaus_and_Godel's_God_in_IsabelleHOL","316452231_Theorem_Provers_For_Every_Normal_Modal_Logic","315682323_Universal_Reasoning_Rational_Argumentation_and_Human-Machine_Interaction","319393396_Resource-bounded_Modelling_and_Analysis_of_Human-level_Interactive_Proofs"]}
