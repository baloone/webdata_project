{"id":"301876927_Modeling_and_Analysis_of_Cellular_Networks_Using_Stochastic_Geometry_A_Tutorial","abstract":"This paper presents a tutorial on stochastic geometry (SG) based analysis for cellular networks. This tutorial is distinguished by its depth with respect to wireless communication details and its focus on cellular networks. The paper starts by modeling and analyzing the baseband interference in a basic cellular network model. Then, it characterizes signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and its related performance metrics. In particular, a unified approach to conduct error probability, outage probability, and rate analysis is presented. Although the main focus of the paper is on cellular networks, the presented unified approach applies for other types of wireless networks that impose interference protection around receivers. The paper then extends the baseline unified approach to capture cellular network characteristics (e.g., frequency reuse, multiple antenna, power control, etc.). It also presents numerical examples associated with demonstrations and discussions. Finally, we point out future research directions.","authors":["Hesham Elsawy","Ahmed Salem","Mohamed-Slim Alouini","Moe Z.
