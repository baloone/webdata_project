{"id":"276398881_Factor_neutral_portfolios","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing a factor neutral portfolio (FNP). This is a portfolio of financial assets that exhibits performance independent from a number of underlying factors. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear program, minimising the time-averaged absolute value factor contribution to portfolio return. In this paper, we investigate both ordinary (least-squares, mean) regression and quantile regression, specifically median regression, to estimate factor coefficients. Computational results are given for constructing FNPs using stocks drawn from the Standard and Poorâ€™s 500 index.","authors":["Cristiano A Valle","Nigel Meade","John E Beasley"],"meta":["February 2015OR Spectrum 37(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00291-015-0392-0"],"references":["314893679_Empirical_Evidence_Against_CAPM_Relating_Alphas_and_Returns_to_Betas","312729484_Regression_quantiles","304425270_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","292131876_Are_the_Fama_and_French_Factors_Global_of_Country_Specific","285237745_DE-a_simple_and_efficient_heuristic_for_global_optimization_over_continuous_space","280806800_Multifactor_Explanations_of_Asset_Pricing_Anomalies","279272290_Portfolio_Selection","278175963_Constructing_and_Testing_Alternative_Versions_of_the_FamaFrench_and_Carhart_Models_in_the_UK","273939484_The_Valuation_of_Risk_Assets_and_The_Selection_of_Risky_Investments_in_Stock_Portfolios_and_Capital_Budgets","273692613_Quantile_regression_applications_and_current_research_areas"]}
