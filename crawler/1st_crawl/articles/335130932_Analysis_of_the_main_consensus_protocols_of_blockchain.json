{"id":"335130932_Analysis_of_the_main_consensus_protocols_of_blockchain","abstract":"Blockchain is the core technology of many cryptocurrencies. Blockchain as a distributed ledger technology has received extensive research attention. In addition to cryptography and P2P (peer-to-peer) technology, consensus protocols are also a fundamental part of the blockchain technology. A good consensus protocol can guarantee the fault tolerance and security of the blockchain systems. The consensus protocols currently used in most blockchain systems can be broadly divided into two categories: the probabilistic-finality consensus protocols and the absolute-finality consensus protocols. This paper introduces some of the main consensus protocols of these two categories, and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses as well as the applicable blockchain types.","authors":["Shijie Zhang","Jong-Hyouk Lee"],"meta":["August 2019ICT Express 6(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.icte.2019.08.001"],"references":["318747828_Ouroboros_A_Provably_Secure_Proof-of-Stake_Blockchain_Protocol","34523809_Practical_Byzantine_fault_tolerance","2437947_Practical_Byzantine_Fault_Tolerance","265116876_PPCoin_Peer-to-Peer_Crypto-Currency_with_Proof-of-Stake","228640975_Bitcoin_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System","2554993_The_Byzantine_Generals_Problem","2540896_Brewer's_Conjecture_and_the_Feasibility_of_Consistent_Available_Partition-Tolerant_Web_Services"]}
