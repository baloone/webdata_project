{"id":"317485812_Is_Driverless_Car_Another_Weiserian_Mistake","abstract":"We present a structured discussion of the concept of driverless car as a major Ubicomp project, and particularly of its hypothetical integration into the fabric of city. The analytical framework is borrowed from the Transportation and Urban research domains, which provides us with a list of agreed-upon subject matters when accounting for car mobility in urban design. We pose concrete questions about each of these subjects as how self-driven personal vehicles could have a positive or negative impact on them. Out of the six discussed topics, this initial examination showed that driverless car could have a negative impact on five, suggesting smoke detected, and thus the need for broadening such inspections.","authors":["Hamed Alavi","Farzaneh Bahrami","Himanshu Verma","Denis Lalanne"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3064857.3079155","Conference: the 2016 ACM Conference Companion Publication","Project: Human-Building Interaction"],"references":["258192332_The_'System'_of_Automobility","344908414_The_End_of_Automobile_Dependence","329311386_The_end_of_automobile_dependence_How_cities_are_moving_beyond_car-based_planning","320181836_Pale_blue_dot_a_vision_of_the_human_future_in_space","315112538_La_disponibilite_de_places_de_stationnement_a-t-elle_un_effet_sur_l'usage_de_la_voiture","314825773_Reducing_automobile_dependence","314185559_Spaces_of_effort_exploration_of_an_experience_of_mobility","274189513_Relations_in_Public_Microstudies_of_the_Public_Order","263567885_Peak_Car_and_Beyond_The_Fourth_Era_of_Travel","259823193_Divining_A_Digital_Future_Mess_and_Mythology_in_Ubiquitous_Computing"]}
