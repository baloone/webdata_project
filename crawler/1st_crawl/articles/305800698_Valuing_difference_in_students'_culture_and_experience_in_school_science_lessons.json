{"id":"305800698_Valuing_difference_in_students'_culture_and_experience_in_school_science_lessons","abstract":"Susan Harper writes about how a cross-cultural learning community can be formed where people from different cultures are not simply assimilated into a school science community but are seen and heard. This makes learning reciprocal and meaningful for both recent refugees and the dominant population. Although maybe not refugees, students from poorer backgrounds in many countries are less likely to choose science at a post-compulsory level. This article discusses some of the potential barriers that are faced by many of these students, that prevent them from participating in school science. It suggests how people involved in school science might address these issues to allow a smoother cultural border crossing between the studentsâ€™ cultures and school science culture by reducing the significance of the crossing.","authors":["Indira Banner"],"meta":["December 2016Cultural Studies of Science Education 11(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11422-016-9729-5"],"references":["336095300_Science_education_and_youth's_identity_construction_-_two_incompatible_projects","319330012_Toward_a_First_Nations_cross-cultural_science_and_technology_curriculum","277998560_The_influence_of_parents_places_and_poverty_on_educational_attitudes_and_aspirations","272160917_Science_Aspirations_Capital_and_Family_Habitus_How_Families_Shape_Children's_Engagement_and_Identification_With_Science","265995434_Minority_Ethnic_Pupils_in_the_Longitudinal_Study_of_Young_People_in_England_LSYPE","303617286_Sources_of_differential_participation_rates_in_school_science_the_impact_of_curriculum_reform","299674976_The_Impact_of_a_Context-Led_Curriculum_on_Different_Students'_Experiences_of_School_Science","285772197_Student_images_of_scientists_What_are_they_Do_they_matter","281137039_Keystone_characteristics_that_support_cultural_resilience_in_Karen_refugee_parents","279894588_Cross-cultural_science_education_A_cognitive_explanation_of_a_cultural_phenomenon"]}
