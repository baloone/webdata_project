{"id":"228747344_Genetic_algorithms_An_overview","abstract":"Genetic algorithms (GAs) are computer programs that mimic the processes of biological evolution in order to solve problems and to model evolutionary systems. In this paper I describe the appeal of using ideas from evolution to solve computational problems, give the elements of simple GAs, survey some application areas of GAs, and give a detailed example of how a GA was used on one particularly interesting problemâ€”automatically discovering good strategies for playing the Prisoner's Dilemma. The paper concludes with a short introduction to the theory of GAs.","authors":["Melanie Mitchell"],"meta":["September 1995Complexity 1(1):31-39","DOI:10.1002/cplx.6130010108"],"references":["258883366_Evolutionary_Phenomena_in_Simple_Dynamics","243652967_The_Proper_Treatment_of_Connectionism","235177007_From_Animals_to_Animats_Second_International_Conference_on_the_Simulation_of_Adaptive_Behavior","201976221_Crossover's_Niche","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","303254010_The_evolution_of_strategies_in_the_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","259022192_Genetic_Algorithms","243775483_Genetic_Algorithms_Data_Structurs_Evolution_Programs","243765452_Evolutionary_phenomena_for_social_dynamics","242356870_Adaptation_In_Natural_And_Artificial_Systems","238362071_Toward_a_Practice_of_Autonomous_Systems","237937027_Survival_of_the_Fittest_Bits","233869892_The_evolution_of_cooperation","226819707_Genetic_algorithms_Foundations_and_applications","220695059_Genetic_AlgorithmData_StructuresEvolution_Programs","220547096_Generalizing_the_Notion_of_Schema_in_Genetic_Algorithms","201976647_Modeling_Simple_Genetic_Algorithms","201976645_Recombination_Distributions_for_Genetic_Algorithms","201976354_Genetic_and_evolutionary_algorithms_come_of_age","201976349_Genetic_Algorithms_and_Walsh_Functions_Part_II_Deception_and_its_Analysis","201976348_Genetic_Algorithms_and_Walsh_Functions_Part_I_A_Gentle_Introduction","201976157_The_Evolution_of_Strategies_in_the_Iterated_Prisoner's_Dilemma","201976023_The_Genetic_Algorithm_and_the_Structure_of_the_Fitness_Landscape","31642995_Artificial_Life_C_G_Langton","30869230_Handbook_Of_Genetic_Algorithms","14853740_Genetic_Algorithms_Principles_of_Natural_Selection_Applied_to_Computation","13233116_Analysis_of_genetic_algorithms_using_statistical_mechanics","2937621_The_Schema_Theorem_and_Price's_Theorem","2777732_Relative_Building-Block_Fitness_and_the_Building-Block_Hypothesis","2771232_Conditions_for_Implicit_Parallelism"]}
