{"id":"277727183_Multi-Agent_System_Applications_in_Healthcare_Current_Technology_and_Future_Roadmap","abstract":"One of the most rapidly evolving government sectors in any country is the healthcare industry. Today, the healthcare system of developed nations is facing the various challenges presented by an aging population. Increasing demand for health services presents a challenge for the existing healthcare industry, as vast amounts of resources will be required. The Multi-Agent System (MAS) approach provides a powerful platform for modeling and solving real world problems such as healthcare. This makes it possible for patients to remain at home and consequently reducing costs. This paper presents developed MAS applications in healthcare, as well as explores the future of developed MAS applications. In particular, it will be argued that these health based MAS applications can provide a reasonable way to mitigate the cost due to increased demand for services.","authors":["Elhadi Shakshuki","Malcolm Reid"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia Computer Science 52(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.071"],"references":["280289011_SOA_Framework_for_Geriatric_Remote_Health_Care_Using_Wireless_Sensor_Network","224333313_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221495672_TeleCARE_Collaborative_virtual_elderly_support_communities","220660843_A_Roadmap_of_Agent_Research_and_Development","220545632_Intelligent_agents_in_home_healthcare","268009997_Applications_of_software_agent_technology_in_the_health_care_domain","224372923_Body_Area_Sensor_Networks_Challenges_and_Opportunities","224085178_A_108_mW_Body_Channel_CommunicationMICS_Dual-Band_Transceiver_for_a_Unified_Body_Sensor_Network_Controller","222802569_JADE_implemented_mobile_multi-agent_based_distributed_information_platform_for_pervasive_health_care_monitoring","220473319_Body_Sensor_Networks_A_Holistic_Approach_From_Silicon_to_Users"]}
