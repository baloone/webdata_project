{"id":"330092803_A_Survey_on_Issues_and_Challenges_of_Web_Service_Development_Composition_Discovery","abstract":"In SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) based application implementation, Web Service (WS) development is one of the outstanding and upcoming area. For web service discovery and composition, developed and refined approaches have been established. It is extremely advantageous to give applicable, appropriate web service to the consumer based on their preferences, constraints, context with high precision, accuracy and at the right time. Many researchers and practitioners have observed issues and challenges in web service development specific to web service discovery and composition separately but nowhere both these issues and challenges have been dealt together. This paper provides an insight of unresolved issues and challenges investigated by researchers in the field of web service development specifically in composing and discovering appropriate web services.","authors":["Tejas Rajnikant Shah","S V Patel"],"meta":["July 2016","Project: Requirement Engineering"],"references":["316655421_Towards_High-Precision_Service_Retrieval","261279765_Context-Aware_Dynamic_Service_Matchmaking","261234818_A_Specialized_Search_Engine_for_Web_Service_Discovery","260329617_Semantic_Web_Service_matchmakers_State_of_the_art_and_challenges","255949411_A_Adala_N_Tabbane_and_S_Tabbane_A_Framework_for_Automatic_Web_Service_Discovery_based_on_Semantics_and_NLP_techniques_Journal_of_Advances_in_Multimedia_-Hindawi_Special_Issue_Web_Services_in_Multimedi","280990176_Automatic_Service_Composition_Via_SimulationUTOMATIC","274573543_A_framework_for_composing_SOAP_non-SOAP_and_non-web_services","262806779_Web_services_composition_A_decade's_overview","262238284_Personalized_Reliability_Prediction_of_Web_Services","261960435_Behavior_modeling_and_automated_verification_of_Web_services"]}
