{"id":"260763115_Establishing_the_Relationship_in_Vulnerability_Classification_for_a_Secure_Software_Testing","abstract":"Having a significance vulnerability clas-sification is important in developing a strong confidence in choosing the damag-ing cases associated with testing prob-lems. The accurate classification helps to explain the belonging of vulnerability. The current research failed to empirically describe these matters, due to the absence of generic classification for testing and assessment. The aim of this paper is to fulfill this gap by enhancing the vulnera-bility classification meant for a secured software testing. This enhancement, which benefited from the issues of users view point and abstraction level, is later implemented in a vulnerability report da-tabase to determine the pattern of vulner-ability relationship. As a result, the pat-terns, which support the traceability as-pect, exposed the ability to be mapped with requirement elicitation through use case notation and served as a practical tool to demonstrate the impact and priori-ty in performing the appropriate secure software testing.","authors":["Nor Hafeizah Hassan","S.
