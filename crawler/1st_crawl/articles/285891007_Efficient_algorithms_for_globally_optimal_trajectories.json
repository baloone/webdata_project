{"id":"285891007_Efficient_algorithms_for_globally_optimal_trajectories","abstract":"Serial and parallel algorithms for solving a system of equations that arises from the discretization of the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation associated to a trajectory optimization problem are presented. After discretization, a solution to the system of nonlinear equations whose structure resembles the structure of the original HJ equation is discussed.","authors":["John N.
