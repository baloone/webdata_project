{"id":"230633469_A_Dynamic_Phase_Selection_Strategy_for_Satisfiability_Solvers","abstract":"The phase selection is an important of a SAT Solver based on conflict-driven\nDPLL. This paper presents a new phase selection strategy, in which the weight\nof each literal is defined as the sum of its implied-literals static weights.\nThe implied literals of each literal is computed dynamically during the search.\nTherefore, it is call a dynamic phase selection strategy. In general, computing\ndynamically a weight is time-consuming. Hence, so far no SAT solver applies\nsuccessfully a dynamic phase selection. Since the implied literal of our\nstrategy conforms to that of the search process, the usual two watched-literals\nscheme can be applied here. Thus, the cost of our dynamic phase selection is\nvery low. To improve Glucose 2.0 which won a Gold Medal for application\ncategory at SAT 2011 competition, we build five phase selection schemes using\nthe dynamic phase selection policy. On application instances of SAT 2011,\nGlucose improved by the dynamic phase selection is significantly better than\nthe original Glucose. We conduct also experiments on Lingeling, using the\ndynamic phase selection policy, and build two phase selection schemes.\nExperimental results show that the improved Lingeling is better than the\noriginal Lingeling.","authors":["Jingchao Chen"],"meta":["August 2012","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220944633_A_Lightweight_Component_Caching_Scheme_for_Satisfiability_Solvers","220944584_Minimizing_Learned_Clauses","220944343_On-the-Fly_Clause_Improvement","220944554_Building_a_Hybrid_SAT_Solver_via_Conflict-Driven_Look-Ahead_and_XOR_Reasoning_Techniques","220812877_Predicting_Learnt_Clauses_Quality_in_Modern_SAT_Solvers","220642599_Solving_Propositional_Satisfiability_Problems","51910399_Phase_Selection_Heuristics_for_Satisfiability_Solvers"]}
