{"id":"323393464_Data_Science_Literature_Review_State_of_Art","abstract":"Since the evolution of internet the amount of data produced each minute is increasing substantially. In order to manage this data there has to be some mechanism. Thousands of terabytes produced each year need to be stored securely and should be accessible easily, this needs high amount of research and development. This new concern has given birth\nto field known as “data science” and people “data scientist”. Today data scientists are working hard to develop new solutions to process and store large amount of data using new techniques. Another major concern today is efficient use of available energy resources, data science helps immensely to predict the usage of resources and minimising the wastage.","authors":["Sanket Mantri"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.18149.70880","Affiliation: Western Sydney University","Project: Data Science: Literature Review & State of Art"],"references":["336150257_SOCIOLOGY_OF_SCIENCE_AND_PREDICTION","272830136_Big_data_analytics_in_healthcare_Promise_and_potential","264848652_Implementation_of_Genetic_Algorithm_in_Predicting_Diabetes","29467751_Top_10_algorithms_in_data_mining","330897725_The_oxford_companion_to_the_history_of_modern_science","300084688_Model_and_experimental_development_for_Business_Data_Science"]}
