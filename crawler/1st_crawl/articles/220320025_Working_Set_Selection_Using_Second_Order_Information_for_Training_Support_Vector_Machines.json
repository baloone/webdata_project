{"id":"220320025_Working_Set_Selection_Using_Second_Order_Information_for_Training_Support_Vector_Machines","abstract":"Working set selection is an important step in decomposition methods for training support vector machines (SVMs). This paper develops a new technique for working set selection in SMO-type decomposition methods. It uses second order information to achieve fast con- vergence. Theoretical properties such as linear convergence are established. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is faster than existing selection methods using first order information.","authors":["Rong-En Fan","Pai-Hsuen Chen","Chih-Jen Lin"],"meta":["December 2005Journal of Machine Learning Research 6:1889-1918","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265409001_IJCNN_2001_Neural_Network_Competition","234786663_Fast_Training_of_Support_Vector_Machines_Using_Sequential_Minimal_Optimization","2464475_Training_Support_Vector_Machines_an_Application_to_Face_Detection","2446719_Improvements_to_Platts_SMO_Algorithm_for_SVM_classifier_design","2376111_A_Training_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Margin_Classifier","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","262333164_Making_Large-Scale_Support_Vector_Machine_Learning_Practical","253871709_Automatic_recognition_of_USGS_land_usecover_categories_using_statistical_and_neural_network_classifiers","248192679_UCI_Repository_of_Machine_Learning_Databases","224141515_Building_projectable_classifiers_of_arbitrary_complexity","221393974_On_the_Complexity_of_Working_Set_Selection","221393885_Training_Support_Vector_Machines_via_SMO-Type_Decomposition_Methods","220695973_Machine_Learning_Neural_and_Statistical_Classification","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","28355923_Making_large-scale_SVM_Learning_Practical","12413257_New_Support_Vector_Algorithms","6928614_A_Study_on_SMO-Type_Decomposition_Methods_for_Support_Vector_Machines","5608624_Asymptotic_convergence_of_an_SMO_algorithm_without_any_assumptions","3303017_On_the_convergence_of_the_decomposition_method_for_support_vector_machines","2462099_Polynomial-Time_Decomposition_Algorithms_for_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
