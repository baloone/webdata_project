{"id":"222507324_Applications_of_Modern_Heuristic_Search_Methods_to_Pattern_Sequencing_Problems","abstract":"This article describes applications of modern heuristic search methods to pattern sequencing problems i.e. problems seeking for a permutation of the rows of a given matrix with respect to some given objective function. We consider two different objectives: minimization of the number of simultaneously open stacks and minimization of the average order spread. Both objectives require the adaptive evaluation of changed solutions to allow an efficient application of neighbourhood search techniques. We discuss the application of several modern heuristic search methods and present computational results.Scope and purposePattern sequencing problems have important applications, especially in the field of production planning. Those problems generally consist of finding a permutation of predetermined production patterns (groupings of some elementary order types) with respect to different objectives. These objectives may represent, e.g., handling costs or stock capacity restrictions, which usually leads to -hard problems. Thus, the use of heuristics to construct respective pattern sequences is generally assumed to be appropriate.","authors":["Andreas Fink","Stefan Voss"],"meta":["December 1999Computers & Operations Research","DOI:10.1016/S0305-0548(98)80001-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["270276879_Problem_Decomposition_and_Data_Reorganisation_by_a_Clustering_Technique","245279890_An_Application_of_Travelling-Salesman_Routines_to_Solve_Pattern-Allocation_Problems_in_the_Glass_Industry","242931106_An_Ordering_Algorithm_for_Analysis_of_Data_Arrays","242931089_Optimal_Linear_Ordering_of_Information_Items","242792560_Heuristics_for_sequencing_cutting_patterns","242565920_Problem_Decomposition_and_Data_Reorganization_by_a_Clustering_Technique","226804099_Hashing_Vectors_for_Tabu_Search","226469338_Optimal_scheduling_in_film_production_to_minimize_talent_hold_cost","222813256_Improved_heuristics_for_sequencing_cutting_patterns","222599364_On_a_pattern_sequencing_problem_to_minimize_the_maximum_number_of_open_stacks","221310250_The_Use_of_Cluster_Analysis_in_Physical_Data_Base_Design","201976997_A_genetic_algorithm_for_the_talent_scheduling_problem","4942587_Establishing_the_optimality_of_sequencing_heuristics_for_cutting_stock_problems","4867346_Simulated_annealing_for_order_spread_minimization_in_sequencing_cutting_patterns","4744674_A_simple_model_for_optimizing_rotational_grazing","2798495_Physical_Mapping_of_Chromosomes_A_Combinatorial_Problem_in_Molecular_Biology","2260361_Reactive_Search_Toward_Self-Tuning_Heuristics"]}
