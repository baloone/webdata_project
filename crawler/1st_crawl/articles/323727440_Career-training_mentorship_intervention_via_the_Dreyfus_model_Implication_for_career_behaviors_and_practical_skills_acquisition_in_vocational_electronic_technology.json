{"id":"323727440_Career-training_mentorship_intervention_via_the_Dreyfus_model_Implication_for_career_behaviors_and_practical_skills_acquisition_in_vocational_electronic_technology","abstract":"One of the employability skills lacking among fresh graduates is the practical skill needed for school-to-work transition. This has resulted to career thwarting behavior among students. Thus, this study determines the longitudinal impact of career-training mentorship intervention on vocational electronic students' career-related behaviors and practical skills learning outcomes. Moreover , this study examines the multiple mediation effects of career learning self-efficacy and work volition on the cause-effect relationship. We employed nonequivalent control-group quasi-experimental design. The participants were 97 vocational electronic technology education students. The results depicted that career-training mentorship intervention has effects on career-related behaviors (planning, intentions, commitment, and reconsideration) and psychomotor skills performance respectively. We also found multiple mediation effects of career learning self-efficacy and work volition on the relationship between predictor (perceived career-training mentorship) and the outcome (career-related behaviors and performance in practical skills) variables.","authors":["Chinyere Tessy Ogbuanya","Samson Chukwuedo"],"meta":["December 2017Journal of Vocational Behavior
