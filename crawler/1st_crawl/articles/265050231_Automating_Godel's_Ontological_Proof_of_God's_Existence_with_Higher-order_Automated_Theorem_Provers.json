{"id":"265050231_Automating_Godel's_Ontological_Proof_of_God's_Existence_with_Higher-order_Automated_Theorem_Provers","abstract":"Kurt Gödel's ontological argument for God's existence has been formalized and automated on a computer with higher-order automated theorem provers. From Gödel's premises, the computer proved: necessarily, there exists God. On the other hand, the theorem provers have also confirmed prominent criticism on Gödel's ontolog-ical argument, and they found some new results about it. The background theory of the work presented here offers a novel perspective towards a computational theoretical philosophy.","authors":["Christoph Benzmüller","Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo"],"meta":["August 2014Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications 263","DOI:10.3233/978-1-61499-419-0-93","Conference: ECAI 2014At: Prag, Czech RepublikVolume: 263, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, IOS Press","Project: Studies in Computational Metaphysics"],"references":["268211706_Automated_Verification_and_Reconstruction_of_Godel's_Proof_of_God's_Existence","260000943_Automation_of_Higher-Order_Logic","259145247_Godel's_God_on_the_Computer","259145246_Godel's_God_in_IsabelleHOL","255994541_Formalization_Mechanization_and_Automation_of_Godel's_Proof_of_God's_Existence","319393811_Intensional_and_Higher-Order_Modal_Logic","275282336_Some_Emendations_of_Godel's_Ontological_Proof","265946028_Logic_and_Theism_Arguments_For_and_Against_Beliefs_in_God","265438718_The_TPTP_problem_library_and_associated_infrastructure_ttthe_FOF_and_CNF_Parts_v350","262280514_Satallax_An_Automatic_Higher-Order_Prover","239829789_LEO-II_-_A_Cooperative_Automatic_Theorem_Prover_for_Classical_Higher-Order_Logic","254237451_Prover9's_Simplification_Explained_Away","254207433_Godel's_Ontological_Proof_Revisited","243787191_Interactive_Theorem_Proving_and_Program_Development","242909357_First-Order_Modal_Logic"]}
