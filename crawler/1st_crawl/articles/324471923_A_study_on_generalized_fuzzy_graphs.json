{"id":"324471923_A_study_on_generalized_fuzzy_graphs","abstract":"Fuzzy graphs are the backbone of many real networks. But, due to some restriction on edges, fuzzy graphs are limited to represent for some networks. In this study, generalized fuzzy graphs and generalized directed fuzzy graphs are discussed to avoid such restrictions. A pipeline network is expressed as a generalized directed fuzzy graph. In the pipeline network, the generalized membership values of edges and vertices are determined by the capacity of the pipelines. Also, fuzzy $r$-cuts and fuzzy $(r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_n)$-cuts in the generalized fuzzy graphs are defined.","authors":["Sovan Samanta","Biswajit Sarkar"],"meta":["September 2018Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 35(10)","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-17285","Project: Generalization of fuzzy graphs"],"references":["313476894_Generalized_fuzzy_trees","310429798_Completeness_and_regularity_of_generalized_fuzzy_graphs","308334420_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Digraphs_in_Decision_Support_Systems","289951972_A_Study_on_Fuzzy_Labeling_Graphs","279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","273176661_Fuzzy_Planar_Graphs","264092332_Novel_Applications_of_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Digraphs_in_Decision_Support_Systems","260712518_Strongest_Strong_Cycles_and_-Fuzzy_Graphs","236943359_Fuzzy_k_-Competition_Graphs_and_p_-Competition_Fuzzy_Graphs","291608143_Regularity_of_Vague_Graphs","291350324_Fuzzy_phi-tolerance_competition_graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","261971465_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Graphs","256721451_Notes_on_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","250727295_Fuzzy_intersection_graphs","223627612_Fuzzy_graphs_in_the_evaluation_and_optimization_of_networks","220313294_Types_of_arcs_in_a_fuzzy_graph","220182834_An_Optimal_Graph_Theoretic_Approach_to_Data_Clustering_Theory_and_Its_Application_to_Image_Segmentation","7990921_An_Experimental_Comparison_of_In-CutMax-Flow_Algorithms_for_Energy_Minimization_in_Vision","3816689_Segmentation_Using_Eigenvectors_A_Unifying_View","3193315_Fast_approximate_energy_minimization_via_graph_cuts_IEEE_PAMI_2311_1222-1239","2477494_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation"]}
