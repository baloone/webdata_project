{"id":"326724946_Research_impacting_the_practice_of_congestion_control","abstract":"Many algorithms proposed in networking research papers are widely used in many areas, including Congestion Control, Routing, Traffic Engineering, and Load Balancing. In this paper, we present algorithmic advancements that have impacted the practice of Congestion Control (CC) in datacenters and the Internet. Where possible, we also describe negative examples, ideas that looked promising on paper or in simulations but that performed poorly in practice. We conclude the paper with observations on the characteristics shared by these ideas in taking them from research to impacting practice.","authors":["Nandita Dukkipati","Yuchung Cheng","Amin Vahdat"],"meta":["July 2018ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 46(3):1-2","DOI:10.1145/3243157.3243171"],"references":["224734039_On_Packet_Switches_with_Infinite_Storage","220623913_CUBIC_a_new_TCP-friendly_high-speed_TCP_variant","305513228_BwE_Flexible_Hierarchical_Bandwidth_Allocation_for_WAN_Distributed_Computing","305510314_BwE_Flexible_Hierarchical_Bandwidth_Allocation_for_WAN_Distributed_Computing","303173802_Data_center_TCP_DCTCP","302452910_Analysis_and_simulation_of_a_fair_queueing_algorithm","279401258_TCP_Vegas","247408749_RFC_2140_TCP_control_block_interdependence","237104353_TCP_control_block_interdependence","221164082_Forward_Acknowledgement_Refining_TCP_Congestion_Control","2425054_TCP_Vegas_New_Techniques_for_Congestion_Detection_and_Avoidance"]}
