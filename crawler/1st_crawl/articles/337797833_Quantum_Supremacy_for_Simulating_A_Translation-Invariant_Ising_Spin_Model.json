{"id":"337797833_Quantum_Supremacy_for_Simulating_A_Translation-Invariant_Ising_Spin_Model","abstract":"We introduce an intermediate quantum computing model built from translation-invariant Ising-interacting spins. Despite being non-universal, the model cannot be classically efficiently simulated unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Equipped with the intrinsic one-instance property, a single fixed unitary evolution in our model is sufficient to produce classically intractable results, compared to several other models that rely on average-case or worst-case hardness. We propose an implementation scheme for our Hamiltonian model using cold atoms in a square lattice, with the requirements well within the reach of current experimental technology. We formulate a scheme to certify the correct functioning of this quantum machine. The certification requires only a polynomial number of local measurements assuming measurement imperfections are sufficiently small.","authors":["Xun Gao","Hong Wang","Lu-Ming Duan"],"meta":["January 2017Physical Review Letters 118(4)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.040502"],"references":["306358304_Fundamental_Limit_for_Universal_Entanglement_Detection","263471647_Computational_quantum-classical_boundary_of_commuting_quantum_circuits","261765980_Hardness_of_Classically_Simulating_the_One-Clean-Qubit_Model","261437125_Stochastic_Simulation_of_Quantum_Systems_and_critical_dynamic","256530600_Measurement-based_quantum_computation","233964580_Photonic_Boson_Sampling_in_a_Tunable_Circuit","50409864_Single-Spin_Addressing_in_an_Atomic_Mott_Insulator","49785441_Efficient_quantum_state_tomography","45708530_Single-Atom_Resolved_Fluorescence_Imaging_of_an_Atomic_Mott_Insulator","32892378_Measurement-based_quantum_computation_on_cluster_states","26864026_Quantum_Simulators","11955500_A_One-Way_Quantum_Computer","9034545_Controlled_collisions_for_multi-particle_entanglement_of_optically_trapped_atoms","301692880_CLASSICAL_CRYPTOGRAPHY_IN_QUANTUM_CONTEXT","281457917_Quantum_multidimensional_operators_with_many_controls","281457776_Mathematical_approaches_for_modified_quantum_calculation","281457767_Indexed_cluster_of_controlled_computational_operators","281457744_Algorithm_for_switching_4_-_bit_packages_in_full_quantum_network_with_multiple_network_nodes","281457730_Quantum_computing_models_for_algebraic_applications","281457711_Theoretically_optimal_computing_frontiers_for_rapid_multiplication_through_decomposition","281430000_Bilaterally_Symmetrical_Transformation_between_Independent_Operators_and_Rotations","281264784_Reply_to_Flexible_flow_shop_scheduling_optimum_heuristics_and_artificial_intelligence_solutions","281176228_Reply_to_The_classical-quantum_boundary_for_correlations_Discord_and_related_measures","280944584_Quantum_algorithm_for_spectral_diffraction_of_probability_distributions","280944013_Encoding_and_decoding_of_additional_logic_in_the_phase_space_of_all_operators","280943699_Measure_of_entanglement_by_Singular_Value_decomposition","279985639_Ensuring_a_spare_quantum_traffic","279985589_Converting_the_transitions_between_quantum_gates_into_rotations","279985511_Quantum_algorithm_for_non-local_coordination","279985421_Quantum_circuit_for_spatial_optimization","279985218_Universal_quantum_operators","278877624_Controlled_formalized_operators_with_multiple_control_bits","278876689_Indexed_formalized_operators_for_n-bit_chains","278873047_Controlled_formalized_operators","278871287_Connecting_sets_of_formalized_operators","276463330_Functional_composition_of_quantum_functions","276463138_Unitary_combinations_of_formalized_classes_in_qubit_space","276463054_Logical_sets_of_quantum_operators","241409049_Electrical_Simulation_of_Quantum_Algorithms","233964576_Boson_Sampling_on_a_Photonic_Chip","232797176_Goals_and_opportunities_in_quantum_simulation","226810696_Simulating_physics_with_computers_Int_J_Theor_Phys_2167467-488","220617790_On_Approximation_Algorithms_for_P","220616368_PP_is_as_Hard_as_the_Polynomial-Time_Hierarchy","47796986_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Linear_Optics","45916527_Classical_simulation_of_commuting_quantum_computations_implies_collapse_of_the_polynomial_hierarchy","44683385_Probing_the_Superfluid-to-Mott_Insulator_Transition_at_the_Single-Atom_Level","41761089_Quantum_computers","38082160_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Linear_Systems_of_Equations","2661734_Algorithms_for_Quantum_Computation_Discrete_Logarithms_and_Factoring","1743640_Universal_Blind_Quantum_Computation","2203419_Entanglement_of_Atoms_via_Cold_Controlled_Collisions","2194483_Quantum_Computing_Postselection_and_Probabilistic_Polynomial-Time"]}
