{"id":"337543770_Space_division_multiplexing_in_standard_multi-mode_optical_fibers_based_on_speckle_pattern_classification","abstract":"In optical communications the transmission bandwidth of single mode optical fibers is almost fully exploited. To further increase the capacity of a telecommunication link, multiplexing techniques can be applied across 5 physical dimensions: amplitude, quadrature, polarization, frequency and space, with all but the latter being nearly exhausted. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of an original space division multiplexing technique based on the classification of speckle patterns measured at the fiber’s output. By coupling multiple optical signals into a standard multimode optical fiber, speckle patterns arise at the fiber’s end facet. This is due to quasi-random interference between the excited modes of propagation. We show how these patterns depend on the parameters of the optical signal beams and the fiber length. Classification of the speckle patterns allows the detection of the independent signals: we can detect the state (i.e. on or off ) of different beams that are multiplexed in the fiber. Our results show that the proposed space division multiplexing on standard multimode fibers is robust to mode-mixing and polarization scrambling effects.","authors":["Jaël Pauwels","Guy Van der Sande","Guy Verschaffelt"],"meta":["November 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-53530-6"],"references":["325696193_Scaling_photonic_lanterns_for_space-division_multiplexing","301895458_Roadmap_on_Optical_Communications","291948112_Communication_networks_beyond_the_capacity_crunch","322945674_Feasibility_of_Space-Division-Multiplexed_Transmission_of_IEEE_80211nac-Compliant_Wireless_MIMO_Signals_over_OM3_Multimode_Fiber","311160307_Space-division-multiplexed_transmission_of_3x3_multiple-input_multiple-output_wireless_signals_over_conventional_graded-index_multimode_fiber","291949422_New_optical_fibres_for_high-capacity_optical_communications","291019330_High-Spatial-Multiplicity_Multicore_Fibers_for_Future_Dense_Space-Division-Multiplexing_Systems","284836755_Evolution_of_EDFA_from_Single-Core_to_Multi-Core_and_Related_Recent_Progress_in_Optical_Communication","276386684_Scaling_Optical_Fiber_Networks_Challenges_and_Solutions","271681509_A_review_of_online_learning_in_supervised_neural_networks"]}
