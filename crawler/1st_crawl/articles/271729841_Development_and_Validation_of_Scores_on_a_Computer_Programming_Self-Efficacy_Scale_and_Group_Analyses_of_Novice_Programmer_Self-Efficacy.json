{"id":"271729841_Development_and_Validation_of_Scores_on_a_Computer_Programming_Self-Efficacy_Scale_and_Group_Analyses_of_Novice_Programmer_Self-Efficacy","abstract":"Self-efficacy theory was applied to the domain of computer programming to develop a thirty-two-item self-efficacy scale for computer programming, primed to the C++ programming language. To assess its construct validity, the scale was administered to 421 students enrolled in an introductory course in C++ programming at the beginning and the end of the course. The reliability of the scores was high. An exploratory factor analysis, with oblimin rotation, yielded a four-factor solution. There was a growth in self-efficacy between two administrations of the scale twelve weeks apart, particularly for students who initially had low self-efficacy. The computer programming self-efficacy of males and females did not differ substantially in practical terms.","authors":["Vennila Ramalingam","Susan Wiedenbeck"],"meta":["December 1998Journal of Educational Computing Research 19(4):367-381","DOI:10.2190/C670-Y3C8-LTJ1-CT3P"],"references":["247727650_Development_and_Validity_of_the_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Scale","240278615_Factorial_Validity_of_a_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Scale_and_the_Impact_of_Computer_Training","233896457_Self-Motivation_for_Academic_Attainment_The_Role_of_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_and_Personal_Goal_Setting","344496460_Self-efficacy_and_educational_development","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","297188340_PEER_MODELS_-_INFLUENCE_ON_CHILDRENS_SELF-EFFICACY_AND_ACHIEVEMENT","271729786_Age_Differences_in_Computer_Anxiety_The_Role_of_Computer_Experience_Gender_and_Education","271729698_Effects_of_Gender_Role_Identity_and_Experience_on_Computer_Attitude_Components","242417043_Gender_and_Computers_The_Beneficial_Effects_of_Experience_on_Attitudes","240278395_Reliability_and_Factorial_Validity_of_Computer_Attitude_Scales","238740667_Self-Efficacy_A_Theoretical_Analysis_of_Its_Determinants_and_Malleability","233896328_Gender-Differences_in_Computer_Experience_and_its_Influence_on_Computer_Attitudes","232582767_Peer_Models_Influence_on_Children's_Self-Efficacy_and_Achievement","232557299_Predicting_Self-Efficacy_and_Performance_During_Skill_Acquisition","232509353_Peer-Model_Attributes_and_Children's_Achievement_Behaviors","232462783_Self-Efficacy_and_Outcome_Expectancy_Mechanisms_in_Reading_and_Writing_Achievement","232454868_Modeling_and_attributional_effects_on_children's_achievement_A_self-efficacy_analysis","232436998_Effects_of_Alternative_Training_Methods_on_Self-Efficacy_and_Performance_in_Computer_Software_Training","232426222_Paths_to_Success_in_the_College_Classroom","229067964_Gender_Differences_in_Self-Efficacy_and_Attitudes_Toward_Computers","220259891_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Development_of_a_Measure_and_Initial_Test","220079462_Application_of_Social_Cognitive_Theory_to_Training_for_Computer_Skills"]}
