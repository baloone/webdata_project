{"id":"266477818_An_introduction_to_Docker_for_reproducible_research_with_examples_from_the_R_environment","abstract":"As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of\nscientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of\nincreasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists\nalike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than\nreplicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of\ncomputer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a\nserious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed\nfor one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by\nsubsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including\nvirtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine\nhow the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems\nresearch - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability,\nmodular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address\nthese challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a\nfocus on the R statistical environment.","authors":["Carl David Boettiger"],"meta":["October 2014ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review 49(1)","DOI:10.1145/2723872.2723882","SourcearXiv"],"references":["290855636_BCE_Berkeley's_Common_Scientific_Compute_Environment_for_Research_and_Education","259208460_Quantifying_Reproducibility_in_Computational_Biology_The_Case_of_the_Tuberculosis_Drugome","256422053_Recommendations_for_utilizing_and_reporting_population_genetic_analyses_the_reproducibility_of_genetic_clustering_using_the_program_STRUCTURE","236921394_Troubling_Trends_in_Scientific_Software_Use","275646230_Dynamic_Documents_with_R_and_knitr","263237820_The_OpenCPU_System_Towards_a_Universal_Interface_for_Scientific_Computing_through_Separation_of_Concerns","262296397_Our_troubles_with_Linux_Kernel_upgrades_and_why_you_should_care","260585487_Virtual_Appliances_Cloud_Computing_and_Reproducible_Research","252066349_Workshop_on_the_Challenges_of_Scientific_Workflows","245340321_An_Extensible_System_for_Design_and_Execution_of_Scientific_Workflows_16"]}
