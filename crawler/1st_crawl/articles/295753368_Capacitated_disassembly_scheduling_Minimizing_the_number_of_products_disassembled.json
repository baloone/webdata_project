{"id":"295753368_Capacitated_disassembly_scheduling_Minimizing_the_number_of_products_disassembled","abstract":"Disassembly scheduling is the problem of determining the timing and quantity of disassembling used products to satisfy the demands of their parts or components over the planning horizon. This paper focuses on the case of single product type without parts commonality while the resource capacity restrictions are explicitly considered. The problem is formulated as an integer program for the objective of minimizing the number of products to be disassembled, and an optimal algorithm, after deriving the properties of the problem, is suggested. Computational experiments are done on randomly generated test problems, and the results are reported.","authors":["JG Kim","HB Jeon","HJ Kim","DH Lee"],"meta":["January 2005Lecture Notes in Computer Science","Conference: International Conference on Computational Science and Its ApplicationsVolume: 3483"],"references":["245330126_Scheduling_disassembly","242934568_State_of_the_Art_Literature_Survey_on_Disassembly_Planning","233493735_Disassembly_of_complex_product_structures_with_parts_and_materials_commonality","229348940_Disassembly_Scheduling_with_Capacity_Constraints","222088004_Disassembly_of_multiple_product_structures","31985714_A_two-stage_heuristic_for_disassembly_scheduling_with_assembly_product_structure"]}
