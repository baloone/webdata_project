{"id":"281658146_Metier_d'eleve_metier_d'enseignant_a_l'ere_numerique","abstract":"This communication deals with the parallel evolutions which go along with the student “job” and the teaching job under ICT. It lays on a research which aims at analysing the role teachers play or are ready to play to accompany their students in a practice widely spread today : the use of Internet in documentary investigations. The difficulties that they find in defining and clearly showing the function they should take in the numerical acculturation of their students, can be measured through the resistances that they express regarding this mission. Indeed, this new function creates an unprecedented situation which breaks with the standards of their teaching culture. The teachers are induced to become actors of a changing world, meanwhile they have themselves to face strong injunctions to make their job evolve in line with the technologies.","authors":["Christine Dioni"],"meta":["February 2008"],"references":["232904429_Usages_Educatifs_des_Technologies_de_L'information_et_de_la_Communication_Quelles_Competences_pour_les_Enseignants","220545620_Trajectoires_d'usages_des_technologies_de_communication_les_formes_d'appropriation_d'une_culture_numerique_comme_enjeu_d'une_societe_du_savoir","313162268_Technologies_de_l'information_et_de_la_communication_dans_l'education_Quelles_competences_pour_les_enseignants","309141556_Analyse_de_la_nature_constructiviste_d'une_activite_d'apprentissage_collaboratif_medie_par_les_TIC","302378424_Cultures_lyceennes_La_tyrannie_de_la_majorite","302371838_La_creation_comme_bien_commun_universel_-_Reflexions_sur_un_modele_emergent","277052064_Le_partage_creatif_un_systeme_de_gouvernance_de_la_distribution_d'oeuvres_en_ligne","272746191_L'invention_du_quotidien_Tome_1_Arts_de_faire","246677993_Les_Hommes_et_les_Technologies_Approche_Cognitive_des_Instruments_Contemporains","237375741_De_l'usage_d'Internet_a_la_culture_de_l'ecran","233898664_Constructivisme_choix_contemporains_Hommage_a_Ernst_von_Glasersfeld_Ste-Foy_Presse_de_l'Universite_du_Quebec"]}
