{"id":"348347692_Systems_of_k_Boolean_inequations_and_a_Boolean_equation","abstract":"In this paper elementary generalized systems of Boolean equations are investigated. The formula for solving systems of k Boolean inequations and a Boolean equation is presented. This systems have many applications in computer science for solving logical problems. Presented formulas can accelerate application of elementary generalized systems of Boolean equations.","authors":["Ulfeta Marovac","Dragić Dusan Banković"],"meta":["January 2020Filomat 34(4):1261-1270","DOI:10.2298/FIL2004261M"],"references":["283804133_Systems_of_k_Boolean_Inequations","279321874_System_of_Two_Boolean_Inequations","268314882_Lattice_Functions_and_Equations","242799661_Formulas_of_general_solutions_of_Boolean_equations","237124065_Boolean_Functions_and_Equations","220574437_Spatial_Query_Optimization_From_Boolean_Constraints_to_Range_Queries","220547644_Boolean_Equations_and_Boolean_Inequations"]}
