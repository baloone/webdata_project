{"id":"323833324_Habits_of_Mind_in_an_Uncertain_Information_World","abstract":"Ours is a fraught time. We see blaring headlines about stolen elections, the questioning of scientific findings and of the scientific method itself, of mutual incomprehension across political and cultural divides, of accepted norms upended, of governing processes questioned, and of facts themselves—facts comporting with reality—doubted. The swirling cacophony of competing viewpoints, perspectives, agendas, and “facts,” accelerated by a saturating and saturated media environment, challenges anyone seeking a firm ground for reasoned debate, reflection, and discussion—and anyone commited to teaching and scholarship. As a profession with ancient and honorable roots, including exposing uncomfortable truths, teaching requires a ground of reliable factuality, a foundation for debate, discussion, and improvement, no matter the level of education, the subject, or the method of instruction.","authors":["Craig Gibson","Trudi Jacobson"],"meta":["March 2018Reference and User Services Quarterly 57(3):183","DOI:10.5860/rusq.57.3.6603"],"references":["261141773_Promoting_High-Impact_Student_Learning_Connecting_Key_Components_of_the_Collegiate_Experience","256422673_Examining_Consumer_Trust_in_Information_Sources_Testing_an_Interdisciplinary_Model","290960039_Transforming_students_Fulfilling_the_promise_of_higher_education","249634304_Transformative_Learning_as_Discourse","226324749_Critical_Reflection_as_an_Adult_Learning_Process","220426199_Credibility_and_Computing_Technology"]}
