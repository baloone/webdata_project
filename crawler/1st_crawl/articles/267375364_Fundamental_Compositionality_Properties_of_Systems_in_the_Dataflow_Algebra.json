{"id":"267375364_Fundamental_Compositionality_Properties_of_Systems_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","abstract":"This report builds on recent work that has developed basic structures for representing the concepts of systems and subsystems within the dataflow algebra, at both its topological and event layers of detail. In particular, this work has defined the restriction and synchronous merge operations and has shown that these represent in the event layer of a system specification the extraction of sub-system behaviour and the composition of sub-systems, and it has established the properties of these operations, including the properties that relate to what is termed the one-step behaviour of sequences. This report develops from this by considering the fundamental properties of compositionality for systems that arise from these properties of these operations, by firstly showing that there are situations where extracting the behaviour of a pair of sub-systems and then composing them together again does not necessarily produce a result that is equal to the original specification, and then secondly establishing the core of what is termed a reconstruction theorem, which defines the conditions under which such a fundamental compositionality property does hold.
