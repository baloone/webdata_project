{"id":"288058912_Graduate_returns_degree_class_premia_and_higher_education_expansion_in_the_UK","abstract":"We investigate the extent to which graduate returns vary according to the class of degree achieved by UK university students,\nand examine changes over time in estimated degree class premia. Using a variety of complementary datasets for individuals\nborn in the UK around 1970 and aged between 30 and 40, we estimate an hourly wage premium for a ‘good’ (relative to a ‘lower’)\nclass of degree of 7% to 9%, implying a wide spread around the average graduate premium. We also estimate the premium for\na good relative to a lower degree for different cohorts (those born between the mid-1960s and early 1980s), and find evidence\nthat the premium for a good degree has risen over time as the proportions of cohorts participating in higher education have\nincreased.","authors":["Robin A.
