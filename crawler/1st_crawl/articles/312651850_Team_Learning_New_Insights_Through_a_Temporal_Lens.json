{"id":"312651850_Team_Learning_New_Insights_Through_a_Temporal_Lens","abstract":"Team learning is a complex social phenomenon that develops and changes over time. Hence, to promote understanding of the fine-grained dynamics of team learning, research should account for the temporal patterns of team learning behavior. Taking important steps in this direction, this special issue offers novel insights into the dynamics of team learning by advocating a temporal perspective. Based on a symposium presented at the 2016 Interdisciplinary Network for Group Research (INGRoup) Conference in Helsinki, the four empirical articles in this special issue showcase four different and innovative approaches to implementing a temporal perspective in team learning research. Specifically, the contributions highlight team learning dynamics in student teams, self-managing teams, teacher teams, and command and control teams. The articles cover a broad range of methods and designs, including both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and longitudinal as well as micro-temporal approaches. The contributors represent four countries and five different disciplines in group research.","authors":["Nale Lehmann-Willenbrock"],"meta":["January 2017Small Group Research 48(2):104649641668930","DOI:10.1177/1046496416689308"],"references":["308045338_Statistical_discourse_analysis_Modeling_sequences_of_individual_actions_during_group_interactions_across_time","302872619_Exploring_Affordances_of_Email_for_Team_Learning_Over_Time","294727858_Understanding_Positivity_Within_Dynamic_Team_Interactions_A_Statistical_Discourse_Analysis","285384990_Team_Adaptiveness_in_Dynamic_Contexts_Contextualizing_the_Roles_of_Interaction_Patterns_and_In-Process_Planning","280084956_How_transformational_leadership_works_during_team_interactions_A_behavioral_process_analysis","277277027_A_Temporal_Common_Ground_for_Learning_The_Moderating_Effect_of_Shared_Mental_Models_on_the_Relation_between_Team_Learning_Behaviours_and_Performance_Improvement","291376383_To_Go_Fast_Go_Slow_Effect_of_Phase_Durations_on_Team_Performance_Trajectories_in_Experimentation","283035765_Applying_sequence_methods_to_the_study_of_team_temporal_dynamics","281210166_Once_upon_a_time_Understanding_team_dynamics_as_relational_event_networks","276944788_Social_and_Cognitive_Factors_Driving_Teamwork_in_Collaborative_Learning_Environments_Team_Learning_Beliefs_and_Behaviors"]}
