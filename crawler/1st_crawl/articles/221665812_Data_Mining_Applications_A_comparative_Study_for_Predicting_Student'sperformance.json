{"id":"221665812_Data_Mining_Applications_A_comparative_Study_for_Predicting_Student'sperformance","abstract":"Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) is a multidisciplinary area\nfocusing upon methodologies for extracting useful knowledge from data and there\nare several useful KDD tools to extracting the knowledge. This knowledge can be\nused to increase the quality of education. But educational institution does not\nuse any knowledge discovery process approach on these data. Data mining can be\nused for decision making in educational system. A decision tree classifier is\none of the most widely used supervised learning methods used for data\nexploration based on divide & conquer technique. This paper discusses use of\ndecision trees in educational data mining. Decision tree algorithms are applied\non students' past performance data to generate the model and this model can be\nused to predict the students' performance. It helps earlier in identifying the\ndropouts and students who need special attention and allow the teacher to\nprovide appropriate advising/counseling.","authors":["Surjeet Kumar","Brijesh Bharadwaj","Saurabh Pal"],"meta":["February 2012","SourcearXiv"],"references":["242472530_Examining_online_learning_processes_based_on_log_files_analysis_A_ca_se_study","242076740_Mining_Student_Data_Using_Decision_Trees","228571634_Mining_Students_Data_to_Analyze_Learning_Behavior_A_Case_Study","51989866_Data_Mining_A_prediction_for_performance_improvement_usingclassification","320663833_Early_Prediction_of_Student_Success_Mining_Students_Enrolment_Data","292545397_Data_mining_model_for_higher_education_system","221996712_Introduction_of_decision_trees","220688795_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","220605492_From_Data_Mining_to_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Databases","51989865_Mining_Educational_Data_to_Analyze_Students'_Performance","51888590_A_Data_Mining_view_on_Class_Room_Teaching_Language","51888589_Data_Mining_A_prediction_of_performer_or_underperformer_usingclassification","44839572_The_Shadow_education_system_private_tutoring_and_its_implications_for_planners","26405291_Scholastic_Achievement_of_Higher_Secondary_Students_in_Science_Stream"]}
