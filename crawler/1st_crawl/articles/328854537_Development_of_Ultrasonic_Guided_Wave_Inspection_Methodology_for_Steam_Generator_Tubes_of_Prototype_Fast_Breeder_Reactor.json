To this aim, axisymmetric longitudinal mode (L(0,2)) at the frequency of 250 kHz is optimized using 3D-finite element simulation and experiments. The group velocity of mode L(0,2) at 250 kHz is found to be 5387 m/s. First, the long range propagation of the L(0,2) mode at 250 kHz is examined and the mode is found to propagate over a distance of 45.6 m with a sufficiently good SNR. Secondly, the detection of multiple defects such as circumferential, axial, partial-pinholes and tapered defects lying in the same line of sight is investigated using 3D-finite element simulation and the results obtained are validated experimentally for the first three cases. The sensitivities achieved are 0.23 mm depth (10%WT) for circumferential, axial and tapered defects and for partial-pinholes: 1 mm diameter and 1.38 mm depth (60%WT). Thirdly, 3D-FE simulations with ID and OD pinhole defects are performed which show that the ID and OD defects are detected by L(0,2) with a fairly similar sensitivity. Finally, study on the thermal expansion bend (with three successive bends) shows that the bend does not have much influence on the mode and the multiple circumferential defects considered in the bend are detected with good sensitivity.","authors":["M.
