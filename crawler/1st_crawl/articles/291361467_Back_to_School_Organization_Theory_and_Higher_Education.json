{"id":"291361467_Back_to_School_Organization_Theory_and_Higher_Education","abstract":"Universities are battlegrounds for epistemological warfare. These skirmishes are deeply linked to the broader society (Gusfeld, 1974). This symposium will focus on higher education as a temple (Collins et al., 2008) that legitimates multiple, competing claims from stakeholders across sectors of society (politicians, businesspeople, lawyers, educators, activists). Each of the presenters will bring attention to the relationship between higher education and the broader society in order to consider how differing institutional templates are enacted and organized within universities.","authors":["D.
