{"id":"45916675_A_Generalized_Diagonal_Wythoff_Nim","abstract":"In this paper we study a family of 2-pile Take Away games, that we denote by Generalized Diagonal Wythoff Nim (GDWN). The story begins with 2-pile Nim whose sets of options and $P$-positions are $\\{\\{0,t\\}\\mid t\\in \\N\\}$ and $\\{(t,t)\\mid t\\in \\M \\}$ respectively. If we to 2-pile Nim adjoin the main-\\emph{diagonal} $\\{(t,t)\\mid t\\in \\N\\}$ as options, the new game is Wythoff Nim. It is well-known that the $P$-positions of this game lie on two 'beams' originating at the origin with slopes $\\Phi= \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}>1$ and $\\frac{1}{\\Phi} < 1$. Hence one may think of this as if, in the process of going from Nim to Wythoff Nim, the set of $P$-positions has \\emph{split} and landed some distance off the main diagonal. This geometrical observation has motivated us to ask the following intuitive question. Does this splitting of the set of $P$-positions continue in some meaningful way if we, to the game of Wythoff Nim, adjoin some new \\emph{generalized diagonal} move, that is a move of the form $\\{pt, qt\\}$, where $0 < p < q$ are fixed positive integers and $t > 0$? Does the answer perhaps depend on the specific values of $p$ and $q$? We state three conjectures of which the weakest form is: $\\lim_{t\\in \\N}\\frac{b_t}{a_t}$ exists, and equals $\\Phi$, if and only if $(p, q)$ is a certain \\emph{non-splitting pair}, and where $\\{\\{a_t, b_t\\}\\}$ represents the set of $P$-positions of the new game. Then we prove this conjecture for the special case $(p,q) = (1,2)$ (a \\emph{splitting pair}). We prove the other direction whenever $q / p < \\Phi$. In the Appendix, a variety of experimental data is included, aiming to point out some directions for future work on GDWN games.
