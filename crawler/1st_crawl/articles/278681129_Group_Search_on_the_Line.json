{"id":"278681129_Group_Search_on_the_Line","abstract":"In this paper we consider the group search problem, or evacu- ation problem, in which k mobile entities (\\({\\cal M}{\\cal E}\\)s) located on the line perform search for a specific destination. The \\({\\cal M}{\\cal E}\\)s are initially placed at the same origin on the line L and the target is located at an unknown distance d, either to the left or to the right from the origin. All \\({\\cal M}{\\cal E}\\)s must simultaneously occupy the destination, and the goal is to minimize the time necessary for this to happen. The problem with k = 1 is known as the cow-path problem, and the time required for this problem is known to be 9d − o(d) in the worst case (when the cow moves at unit speed); it is also known that this is the case for k ≥ 1 unit-speed \\({\\cal M}{\\cal E}\\)s. In this paper we present a clear argument for this claim by showing a rather counter-intuitive result. Namely, independent of the number of \\({\\cal M}{\\cal E}\\)s, group search cannot be performed faster than in time 9d − o(d). We also examine the case of k = 2 \\({\\cal M}{\\cal E}\\)s with different speeds, showing a surprising result that the bound of 9d can be achieved when one \\({\\cal M}{\\cal E}\\) has unit speed, and the other \\({\\cal M}{\\cal E}\\) moves with speed at least 1/3.","authors":["Marek Chrobak","Leszek Gasieniec","Thomas Gorry","Russell Martin"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-46078-8_14","Conference: International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Informatics"],"references":["221590590_The_Power_of_a_Pebble_Exploring_and_Mapping_Directed_Graphs","221044572_Search_on_Lines_and_Graphs","220249114_The_Power_of_a_Pebble_Exploring_and_Mapping_Directed_Graphs","30529942_The_Theory_of_Search_Games_and_Rendezvous","262279192_Searching_with_uncertainty","257308817_Revisiting_the_Problem_of_Searching_on_a_Line","257285777_Searching_in_the_Plane","224161995_Whittle-indexability_of_the_Cow_Path_Problem","222701595_Parallel_Searching_on_m_Rays","222694793_Online_algorithms_for_searching_and_exploration_in_the_plane","222299652_On_the_two-dimensional_cow_search_problem","220898264_Searching_a_Fixed_Graph","220897078_Tell_Me_Where_I_Am_So_I_Can_Meet_You_Sooner","220556774_Parallel_Searching_in_the_Plane","38350390_Rendezvous_search_on_a_graph","2456737_Searching_in_an_Unknown_Environment_An_Optimal_Randomized_Algorithm_for_the_Cow-Path_Problem"]}
