{"id":"279766317_Fuzzy_dot_subalgebras_and_fuzzy_dot_ideals_of_B-algebras","abstract":"In this paper, the notions of fuzzy dot subalgebras, fuzzy normal dot subalgebras and fuzzy dot ideals of B-algebras are introduced and investigated some of their properties. The homomorphic image and inverse image of fuzzy dot subalgebras and fuzzy dot ideals are studied. Also introduced the notion of fuzzy relations on the family of fuzzy dot subalgebras and fuzzy dot ideals of B-algebras and investigated some related properties.","authors":["Tapan Senapati","Monoranjan Bhowmik","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["February 2014Journal of Uncertain Systems 8(1):22-30"],"references":["285243358_Intuitionistic_fuzzifications_of_ideals_in_BG-algebras","280879198_Fuzzy_topological_B-algebras","255172346_Interval-valued_fuzzy_B-algebras","285528252_On_B-algebras","285361171_Fuzzy_closed_ideals_of_B-algebras_International_Journal_of_Computer_Science","280879272_Interval-valued_fuzzy_B-algebras","267002867_Some_axiomatizations_of_B-algebras","266423775_On_B-algebras_and_quasigroups","265491468_On_quadratic_B-algebras","264016943_On_fuzzy_subalgebras_in_B-algebras"]}
