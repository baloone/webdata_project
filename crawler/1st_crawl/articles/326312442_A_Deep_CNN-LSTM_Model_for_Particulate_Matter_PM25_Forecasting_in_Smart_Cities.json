{"id":"326312442_A_Deep_CNN-LSTM_Model_for_Particulate_Matter_PM25_Forecasting_in_Smart_Cities","abstract":"In modern society, air pollution is an important topic as this pollution exerts a critically bad influence on human health and the environment. Among air pollutants, Particulate Matter (PM2.5) consists of suspended particles with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 Î¼m. Sources of PM2.5 can be coal-fired power generation, smoke, or dusts. These suspended particles in the air can damage the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of the human body, which may further lead to other diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, or cardiovascular diseases. To monitor and estimate the PM2.5 concentration, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are combined and applied to the PM2.5 forecasting system. To compare the overall performance of each algorithm, four measurement indexes, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) Pearson correlation coefficient and Index of Agreement (IA) are applied to the experiments in this paper. Compared with other machine learning methods, the experimental results showed that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed CNN-LSTM model (APNet) is verified to be the highest in this paper. For the CNN-LSTM model, its feasibility and practicability to forecast the PM2.5 concentration are also verified in this paper. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a deep neural network model that integrates the CNN and LSTM architectures, and through historical data such as cumulated hours of rain, cumulated wind speed and PM2.5 concentration. In the future, this study can also be applied to the prevention and control of PM2.5.","authors":["Chiou-Jye Huang","Ping-Huan Kuo"],"meta":["July 2018Sensors 18(7):2220","DOI:10.3390/s18072220"],"references":["325427645_Solar_Radiation_Estimation_Algorithm_and_Field_Verification_in_Taiwan","322965730_Identification_of_Pancreatic_Injury_in_Patients_with_Elevated_Amylase_or_Lipase_Level_Using_a_Decision_Tree_Classifier_A_Cross-Sectional_Retrospective_Analysis_in_a_Level_I_Trauma_Center","322948127_Development_of_Easily_Accessible_Electricity_Consumption_Model_Using_Open_Data_and_GA-SVR","322848206_Investigation_of_Pear_Drying_Performance_by_Different_Methods_and_Regression_of_Convective_Heat_Transfer_Coefficient_with_Support_Vector_Machine","322590176_Sustainability_Evaluation_of_Power_Grid_Construction_Projects_Using_Improved_TOPSIS_and_Least_Square_Support_Vector_Machine_with_Modified_Fly_Optimization_Algorithm","321985791_Analyzing_Land_Cover_Change_and_Urban_Growth_Trajectories_of_the_Mega-Urban_Region_of_Dhaka_Using_Remotely_Sensed_Data_and_an_Ensemble_Classifier","321237360_Prediction_of_Mortality_in_Patients_with_Isolated_Traumatic_Subarachnoid_Hemorrhage_Using_a_Decision_Tree_Classifier_A_Retrospective_Analysis_Based_on_a_Trauma_Registry_System","320843907_Adaptive_Sampling_for_Urban_Air_Quality_through_Participatory_Sensing","320696256_Short-Term_Multiple_Forecasting_of_Electric_Energy_Loads_for_Sustainable_Demand_Planning_in_Smart_Grids_for_Smart_Homes","322260783_Class_Weights_Random_Forest_Algorithm_for_Processing_Class_Imbalanced_Medical_Data"]}
