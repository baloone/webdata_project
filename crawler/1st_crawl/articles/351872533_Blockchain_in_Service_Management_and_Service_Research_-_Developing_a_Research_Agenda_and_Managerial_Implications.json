{"id":"351872533_Blockchain_in_Service_Management_and_Service_Research_-_Developing_a_Research_Agenda_and_Managerial_Implications","abstract":"As blockchain technology is maturing to be confidently used in practice, its applications are becoming evident and, correspondingly, more blockchain research is being published, also extending to more domains than before. To date, scientific research in the field has predominantly focused on subject areas such as finance, computer science, and engineering, while the area of service management has largely neglected this topic. Therefore, we invited a group of renowned scholars from different academic fields to share their views on emerging topics regarding blockchain in service management and service research. Their individual commentaries and conceptual contributions refer to different theoretical and domain perspectives, including managerial implications for service companies as well as forward-looking suggestions for further research.","authors":["Marion BÃ¼ttgen","Julia Dicenta","Kai Spohrer","Viswanath Venkatesh"],"meta":["May 2021Journal of Service Management Research 5(2):71-102"],"references":["348018889_Cryptocurrency_adoption_in_travel_and_tourism_-_an_exploratory_study_of_Asia_Pacific_travellers","347910057_A_novel_decentralized_platform_for_peer-to-peer_energy_trading_market_with_blockchain_technology","346073403_Understanding_manager_resistance_to_blockchain_systems","344617969_A_blockchain_based_peer-to-peer_trading_framework_integrating_energy_and_carbon_markets","355492521_Attacking_the_DeFi_Ecosystem_with_Flash_Loans_for_Fun_and_Profit","350907670_Decentralized_Finance_On_Blockchain-_and_Smart_Contract-Based_Financial_Markets","348019485_Surfing_blockchain_wave_or_drowning_Shaping_the_future_of_distributed_ledgers_and_decentralized_technologies","345308510_Disrupting_the_Disruptors_or_Enhancing_Them_How_Blockchain_Re-Shapes_Two-Sided_Platforms","344959048_Blockchain_research_practice_and_policy_Applications_benefits_limitations_emerging_research_themes_and_research_agenda","344327931_Resume_Resume_The_effects_of_blockchain_social_media_and_classical_resumes_on_resume_fraud_and_applicant_reactions_to_resumes"]}
