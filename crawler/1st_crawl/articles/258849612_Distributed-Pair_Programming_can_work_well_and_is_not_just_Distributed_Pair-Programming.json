{"id":"258849612_Distributed-Pair_Programming_can_work_well_and_is_not_just_Distributed_Pair-Programming","abstract":"Background: Distributed Pair Programming can be performed via screensharing or via a distributed IDE. The latter offers the freedom of concurrent editing (which may be helpful or damaging) and has even more awareness deficits than screen sharing.\nObjective: Characterize how competent distributed pair programmers may handle this additional freedom and these additional awareness deficits and characterize the impacts on the pair programming process.\nMethod: A revelatory case study, based on direct observation of a single, highly competent distributed pair of industrial software developers during a 3-day collaboration. We use recordings of these sessions and conceptualize the phenomena seen.\nResults: 1.Skilled pairs may bridge the awareness deficits without visible obstruction of the overall process. 2.Skilled pairs may use the additional editing freedom in a useful limited fashion, resulting in potentially better fluency of the process than local pair programming.\nConclusion: When applied skillfully in an appropriate context, distributed-pair programming can (not will!) work at least as well as local pair programming.","authors":["Julia Schenk","Lutz Prechelt","Stephan Salinger"],"meta":["November 2013","DOI:10.1145/2591062.2591188","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262685186_On_Knowledge_Transfer_Skill_in_Pair_Programming","262257884_Distance_Matters","261316662_Liberating_pair_programming_research_from_the_oppressive_driverobserver_regime","313390246_Basics_of_qualitative_research_Grounded_theory_procedures_and_techniques","277468861_Familiarity_Complexity_and_Team_Performance_in_Geographically_Distributed_Software_Development","277072162_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change_2nd_Edition","269199849_Operational_transformation_in_real-time_group_editors","263849049_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","261418713_Problems_We_All_Know_We_Have_Them_Do_We_Have_Solutions_Too_A_Literature_Review_on_Problems_and_Their_Solutions_in_Global_Software_Development","259045623_Agile_Software_Development_with_Distributed_Teams","238170394_A_Video-enhanced_Environment_for_Distributed_Extreme_Programming","234820806_Crystal_clear_a_human-powered_methodology_for_small_teams","254004045_What_Agile_Teams_Think_of_Agile_Principles","245581479_Basics_Of_Qualitative_Research_Grounded_Theory_Procedures_And_Techniques","242350998_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change"]}
