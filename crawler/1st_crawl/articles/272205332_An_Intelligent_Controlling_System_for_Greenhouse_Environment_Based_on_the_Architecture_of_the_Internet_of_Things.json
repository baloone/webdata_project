It is a critical issue to develop the methodology for better environment control of greenhouses. This paper proposes an intelligent controlling system for greenhouses\nbased on the architecture of the Internet of Things. The wireless sensor nodes and relay nodes are designed associating the physical world with the information world. Using 3G or TCP/IP network as the channel of the network of the Internet of Things, users can completely control the systems,\ntreat and analyze data via browsers in any place and at any time without need for installing any special device or software. The system carries out the paradigm of the Dynamic Data Driven Application System enabling the simulation to receive the continuous data injected from the perception\nlayer of the system and to dynamically make response. The faster-than-real-time simulation is implemented based on the established self-adaptation model. The factors about the environments of crop growing are predicted and evaluated. At the same time, the results produced by the simulation\nare fed back to the system software to control the actions of executive devices in the real-time mode forming a closed controlling loop. The management function of the system software allows to flexibly set the executive devises of the greenhouses and to establish the completely new controlling\nrules with high degree of freedom. Consequently, the software system combined with the expert system can adapt to various greenhouses in different types and sizes.","authors":["Hao Luo","Peiling Yang","Yunkai Li","Feipeng Xu"],"meta":["January 2012Sensor Letters 10(1):514-522","DOI:10.1166/sl.2012.1850"],"references":["236183037_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Networking_Perspective"]}
