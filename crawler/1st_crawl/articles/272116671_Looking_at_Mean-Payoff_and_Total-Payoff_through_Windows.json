{"id":"272116671_Looking_at_Mean-Payoff_and_Total-Payoff_through_Windows","abstract":"We consider two-player games played on weighted directed graphs with mean-payoff and total-payoff objectives, two classical quantitative objectives. While for single-dimensional games the complexity and memory bounds for both objectives coincide, we show that in contrast to multi-dimensional mean-payoff games that are known to be coNP-complete, multi-dimensional total-payoff games are undecidable. We introduce conservative approximations of these objectives, where the payoff is considered over a local finite window sliding along a play, instead of the whole play. For single dimension, we show that (i) if the window size is polynomial, deciding the winner takes polynomial time, and (ii) the existence of a bounded window can be decided in NP âˆ© coNP, and is at least as hard as solving mean-payoff games. For multiple dimensions, we show that (i) the problem with fixed window size is EXPTIME-complete, and (ii) there is no primitive-recursive algorithm to decide the existence of a bounded window.","authors":["Krishnendu Chatterjee","Laurent Doyen","Mickael Randour","Jean-Francois Raskin"],"meta":["March 2015Information and Computation 242:25-52","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2015.03.010"],"references":["272133839_Strategy_Synthesis_for_Multi-Dimensional_Quantitative_Objectives","262256395_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Energy_Games_with_Special_Weight_Structures","256926227_Meet_Your_Expectations_With_Guarantees_Beyond_Worst-Case_Synthesis_in_Quantitative_Games","235638894_Looking_at_Mean-Payoff_and_Total-Payoff_through_Windows","232238221_Synthesis_from_LTL_Specifications_with_Mean-Payoff_Objectives","225690595_Model_Checking_Probabilistic_Timed_Automata_with_One_or_Two_Clocks","225621458_Faster_algorithms_for_mean-payoff_games","225156893_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","222079059_Cyclic_games_and_an_algorithm_to_find_minimax_cycle_means_in_directed_graphs","221659578_Strategy_Synthesis_for_Multi-dimensional_Quantitative_Objectives","221570211_Church_Synthesis_Problem_for_Noisy_Input","221403175_Games_through_Nested_Fixpoints","220975873_When_Can_You_Play_Positionally","220589096_Cyclical_games_with_prohibitions","220444377_Nets_with_Tokens_Which_Carry_Data","45928487_Generalized_Mean-payoff_and_Energy_Games","37443197_From_Liveness_to_Promptness","2882541_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2206448_Model_Checking_Probabilistic_Timed_Automata_with_One_or_Two_Clocks","312995330_Finitary_Winning_in_omega-Regular_Games","291295228_Meet_Your_Expectations_With_Guarantees_Beyond_Worst-Case_Synthesis_in_Quantitative_Games","284232096_Chapter-02_Heart_Failure_Diagnosis","268164050_Efficient_and_Dynamic_Algorithms_for_Alternating_Buchi_Games_and_Maximal_End-Component_Decomposition","266066629_Competitive_Markov_Decision_Processes","265996860_Mean_Cost_Cyclical_Games","265367079_Borel_Determinacy","262276852_Finitary_winning_in_o-regular_games","249963949_Approximating_the_minimum_cycle_mean","242597597_A_characterization_of_the_minimum_cycle_mean_in_a_digraph","238878217_Stochastic_Games_with_Perfect_Information_and_Time_Average_Payoff","238727704_Recursive_Unsolvability_of_Post's_Problem_of_Tag_and_other_Topics_in_Theory_of_Turing_Machines","234113758_Infinite-state_games_with_finitary_conditions","230853972_The_Complexity_of_Multi-Mean-Payoff_and_Multi-Energy_Games","226950761_Potential_theory_for_mean_payoff_games","226645887_Positional_strategies_for_mean_payoff_games","226578002_Zum_Hilbertschen_Aufbau_der_reellen_Zahlen","222785304_The_complexity_of_mean_payoff_games_on_graphs","222672970_Verifying_lossy_channel_systems_has_nonprimitive_recursive_complexity","222504823_Deciding_the_winner_in_parity_games_is_in_UP_co-UP","220975230_A_Combinatorial_Strongly_Subexponential_Strategy_Improvement_Algorithm_for_Mean_Payoff_Games","220897416_Reset_Nets_Between_Decidability_and_Undecidability","220852442_Finitary_Winning_in_o-Regular_Games","220431245_Alternation","47387444_The_surprizing_complexity_of_generalized_reachability_games","3510377_Tree_automata_mu-calculus_and_determinacy","2775618_Finitary_Fairness"]}
