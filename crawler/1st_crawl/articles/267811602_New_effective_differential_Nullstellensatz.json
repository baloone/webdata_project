{"id":"267811602_New_effective_differential_Nullstellensatz","abstract":"We show new upper and lower bounds for the effective differential\nNullstellensatz for differential fields of characteristic zero with several\ncommuting derivations. Seidenberg was the first to address this problem in\n1956, without giving a complete solution. The first explicit bounds appeared in\n2009 in a paper by Golubitsky, Kondratieva, Szanto, and Ovchinnikov, with the\nupper bound expressed in terms of the Ackermann function. D'Alfonso, Jeronimo,\nand Solern\\'o, using novel ideas, obtained in 2014 a new bound if restricted to\nthe case of one derivation and constant coefficients. To obtain the bound in\nthe present paper without this restriction, we extend this approach and use the\nnew methods of Freitag and Le\\'on S\\'anchez and of Pierce from 2014, which\nrepresent a model-theoretic approach to differential algebraic geometry.","authors":["Richard Gustavson","Marina Kondratieva","Alexey Ovchinnikov"],"meta":["November 2014Advances in Mathematics 290(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.aim.2015.12.021","SourcearXiv"],"references":["227251322_On_the_effective_Nullstellensatz","221521099_Complexity_of_quantifier_elimination_in_the_theory_of_ordinary_differential_equations","41106962_Computing_representations_for_radicals_of_finitely_generated_differential_ideals","2143031_Sharp_estimates_for_the_arithmetic_Nullstellensatz","1738707_Jet_and_prolongation_spaces","321876957_Algebre_commutative","307959304_Sharp_effective_Nullstellensatz","284813810_Testing_polynomials_which_are_easy_to_compute_Logic_and_algorithmic_An_international_symposium_held_in_honor_of_ernst_specker","281427749_On_bounds_for_the_effective_differential_Nullstellensatz","275978486_An_Elimination_Theory_for_Differential_Algebra","270150594_An_Introduction_to_Differential_Algebra","267759802_Effective_uniform_bounding_in_partial_differential_fields","266434226_Complexity_of_elimination_of_quantifiers_in_the_theory_of_ordinary_differentially_closed_fields","260042194_Effective_differential_Nullstellensatz_for_ordinary_DAE_systems_with_constant_coefficients","247720458_Testing_polynomials_which_are_easy_to_compute","245916179_Differential_algebra_and_diophantine_geometry","243773634_An_Elimination_Theory_for_Differential_Algebra","243763350_Bounds_for_the_degrees_in_the_NullstellensatzAnnals_of_Math_126_577-591","239285409_Sharp_Effective_Nullstellensatz","222813784_A_bound_for_orders_in_differential_Nullstellensatz","222529300_Factorization-free_Decomposition_Algorithms_in_Differential_Algebra","221420895_The_Complexity_of_Formal_Resolution_of_Linear_Partial_Differential_Equations","220161441_A_Combinatorial_Proof_of_the_Effective_Nullstellensatz","51890151_Nonstandard_methods_for_bounds_in_differential_polynomial_rings","36993086_Differential_Algebra_and_Algebraic_Groups","2804007_Model_Theory_Of_Differential_Fields","1761055_Fields_with_several_commuting_derivations"]}
