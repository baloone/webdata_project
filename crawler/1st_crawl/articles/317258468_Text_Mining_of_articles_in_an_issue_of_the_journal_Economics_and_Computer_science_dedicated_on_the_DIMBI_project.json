Since business intelligence methods are many, the research is limited to text mining methods. The research aim is to find terminology which is common for all articles in one issue of the journal. Since the journal has published several thematic issues, it is a research questions to find ontologies in each thematic issue. Rapid Miner is used as a software tool to conduct the text mining techniques. The most frequently used terms are found by Rapid Miner. A manual thematic classification of terms is done. The main groups are: educational, research and software. The proposed methodology may be used by other authors for other surveys in different thematic content.","authors":["Natalia Marinova","Julian Vasilev"],"meta":["January 2017Ekonomiczne Problemy Usług 2(1):153-159","DOI:10.18276/epu.2017.126/2-16","Project: „Developing the innovative methodology of teaching Business Informatics"],"references":["308974399_A_Survey_of_the_applications_of_Text_mining_in_Financial_Domain","280113623_The_Text_Mining_Handbook_Advanced_Approaches_in_Analyzing_Unstructured_Data","273303216_Selection_criteria_for_text_mining_approaches","2559145_Untangling_Text_Data_Mining"]}
