{"id":"328675340_Positive_Zero-Sum_Stochastic_Games_with_Countable_State_and_Action_Spaces","abstract":"A positive zero-sum stochastic game with countable state and action spaces is shown to have a value if, at every state, at least one player has a finite action space. The proof uses transfinite algorithms to calculate the upper and lower values of the game.
