{"id":"249886315_A_Wavelet-based_Image_Retrieval_System","abstract":"In this report, we propose a wavelet-based content descriptor with which we implement an image retrieval system. Initially, we propose the wavelet-based weighted standard deviation texture descriptor. We then show how to extend this descriptor to characterize both texture and color in images. Thus, we obtain a compact feature vector that characterizes images in terms of both texture and color. We use this feature vector to implement an image retrieval system, using the weighted L1 distance measure.","authors":["Sitaram Bhagavathy","Kapil Chhabra"],"meta":[],"references":["220502008_Texture_analysis_and_classification_with_tree-structured_wavelet_transform","220182992_Texture_Features_for_Browsing_and_Retrieval_of_Image_Data","3327063_WaveGuide_A_joint_wavelet-based_image_representation_and_description_system","238684297_Textures_a_photographic_album_for_artists_and_designers"]}
