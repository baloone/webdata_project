This article aims for providing an early stage contribution with the decision making capacities of artificial intelligence technologies. The possible ethical and legally complex backdrop of the existing framework. I will conclude the present structures are largely fit to deal with the challenge of artificial intelligence are present will discuss clearly about the artificial intelligence contribution to the present health care. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning can assist with proactive patient care, reduced future risk and streamlined work processes.
