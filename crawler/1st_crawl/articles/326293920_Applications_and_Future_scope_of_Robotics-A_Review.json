{"id":"326293920_Applications_and_Future_scope_of_Robotics-A_Review","abstract":"Robotics is the confluence of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science also it is no more an emerging field as it has evolved so much in the last 10 years and it is nearing an apex point .It is an ever growing field and many avenues have opened up in recent past. The promise of robotics is easy to describe but hard for the mind to grasp. A robot is a mechanical or virtual intelligent agent that can perform tasks automatically or with guidance, typically by remote control. In practice a robot is usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by computer and electronic programming. Robots hold the promise of moving and transforming materials with the same ease as a computer program transforms data. But the grey spot remains wide when it comes to Research awareness in the field of Robotics and Automation. Sooner or later Robotics and automation will find its application in every facet of human life. The advancement in technology would bring a day of robots omnipresence. They will soon sneak everywhere from gadgets to apparels and to our very own bodies. Hence it is the responsibility of engineering community to disseminate the knowledge about the future scope and application of Robotics","authors":["Baskaran Shanmugavel","Ramesh Kumar T","Karrthik R"],"meta":["June 2018"],"references":[]}
