{"id":"265153964_SPATIAL_DATA_INFRASTRUCTURES_IN_EUROPE","abstract":"1. Abstract. The presentation will consider some recent developments in spatial data infrastructures in Europe. It will be divided into three parts. The first of these examines the changing technological and governmental context that has prompted the recent surge of national spatial data infrastructure initiatives in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Then the experiences of NSDI initiatives in Portugal, Netherlands, Britain and Hungary will be described and evaluated in comparative terms. The final part of the presentation will describe the work that is being currently undertaken by the European Umbrella Organi-sation for Geographic Information (EUROGI) to facilitate the development and imple-mentation of spatial data infrastructures at the national, regional and global levels.","authors":["Ian Masser"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
