{"id":"325661702_Technology_Acceptance_Model_in_M-learning_context_A_systematic_review","abstract":"Various review studies were conducted to provide valuable insights into the current research trend of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Nevertheless, this issue still needs to be investigated from further directions. It has been noticed that research overlooks the investigation of TAM with regard to Mobile learning (M-learning) studies from the standpoint of different perspectives. The present study systematically reviews and synthesizes the TAM studies related to M-learning aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of 87 research articles from 2006 to 2018. The main findings include that most of the TAM studies involving M-learning focused on extending the TAM with external variables, followed by the studies that extended the model by factors from other theories/models. In addition, the main research problem that was frequently tackled among all the analyzed studies was to examine the acceptance of M-learning among students. Moreover, questionnaire surveys were the primarily relied research methods for data collection. Additionally, most of the analyzed studies were undertaken in Taiwan, this is followed by Spain, China, and Malaysia, respectively among the other countries. Besides, most of the analyzed studies were frequently conducted in humanities and educational context, followed by IT and computer science context, respectively among the other contexts. Most of the analyzed studies were carried out in the higher educational settings. To that end, the findings of this review study provide an insight into the current trend of TAM research involving M-learning studies and form an essential reference for scholars in the M-learning context.","authors":["Mostafa Al-Emran","Vitaliy Mezhuyev","Adzhar Kamaludin"],"meta":["June 2018Computers & Education
