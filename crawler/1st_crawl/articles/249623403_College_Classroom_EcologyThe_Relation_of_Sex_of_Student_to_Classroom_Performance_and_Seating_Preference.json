{"id":"249623403_College_Classroom_EcologyThe_Relation_of_Sex_of_Student_to_Classroom_Performance_and_Seating_Preference","abstract":"Observations were made for 12 general psychology classes taught over a 6-year period. Results showed that women sat in the front of the classroom more often than men, and also obtained higher grades and cut class fewer times than men. Furthermore, for men and women, grade point average decreased and number of absences increased as students sat farther from the front of the room.","authors":["Charles I.
