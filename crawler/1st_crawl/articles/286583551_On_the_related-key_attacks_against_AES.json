{"id":"286583551_On_the_related-key_attacks_against_AES","abstract":"Alex Biryukov and Dmitry Khovratovich presented related-key attacks on AES and reduced-round versions of AES. The most impressive of these were presented at Asiacrypt 2009: related-key attacks against the full AES-256 and AES-192. We discuss the applicability of these attacks and related-key attacks in general. We model the access of the attacker to the key in the form of key access schemes. Related-key attacks should only be considered with respect to sound key access schemes. We show that defining a sound key access scheme in which the related-key attacks against AES-256 and AES-192 can be conducted, is possible, but contrived.","authors":["Joan Daemen","Vincent Rijmen"],"meta":["October 2012Proceedings of the Romanian Academy - Series A: Mathematics, Physics, Technical Sciences, Information Science 13(4):395-400"],"references":["227322303_New_Impossible_Differential_Attacks_on_AES","221590460_The_Random_Oracle_Methodology_Revisited_Preliminary_Version","221354789_Distinguisher_and_Related-Key_Attack_on_the_Full_AES-256","221326929_Biclique_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Full_AES","220618451_How_to_Construct_Pseudorandom_Permutations_from_Pseudorandom_Functions","220335231_Related-key_cryptanalysis_of_the_full_AES-192_and_AES-256","226173374_Shamir_A_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES-like_Cryptosystems_Journal_of_Cryptology_41_3-72"]}
