We explain what brought us to develop consolidation rules based in remediation indices. We describe how the analysis model can be implemented in practice.","authors":["Jean-Louis Letouzey","Thierry Coq"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1109/VALID.2010.31","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Advances in System Testing and Validation Lifecycle (VALID), 2010 Second International Conference on"],"references":["3187649_Kemerer_CF_A_metric_suite_for_object_oriented_design_IEEE_Trans_Softw_Eng_206_476-493","2954310_Using_Metrics_to_Evaluate_Software_System_Maintainability","305296096_Towards_a_Metrics_Suite_for_Object_Oriented_Design","269159254_A_metrics_suit_for_object_oriented_design","247572563_Software_Metrics-A_Rigorous_and_Practical_Approach_Second_Edition","242530079_Quality_is_Free_The_Art_of_Making_Quality_Certain","239007241_Structured_testing_a_software_testing_methodology_using_the_cyclomatic_complexity_metric","237335431_Structured_Testing_A_Testing_Methodology_Using_the_Cyclomatic_Complexity_Metric","236944400_Software_Metrics_A_Rigorous_Practical_Approach","229028884_The_SQALE_Models_for_Assessing_the_Quality_of_Real_Time_Source_Code"]}
