{"id":"335435092_Keys_in_Relational_Databases_with_Nulls_and_Bounded_Domains","abstract":"Missing data value is an extensive problem in both research and industrial developers. Two general approaches are there to deal with the problem of missing values in databases, they either could be ignored (removed) or imputed (filled in) with new values [10]. For some SQL tables it is possible that some candidate key of the table is not null-free and this needs to be handled. Possible keys and certain keys to deal with this situation were introduced in [17]. In the present paper we introduce an intermediate concept called strongly possible keys that is based on a data mining approach using only information already contained in the SQL table. A strongly possible key is a key that holds for some possible world which is obtained by replacing any occurrences of nulls with some values already appearing in the corresponding attributes. Implication among strongly possible keys is characterized and Armstrong tables are constructed. An algorithm to verify a strongly possible key is given applying bipartite matching. Connection between matroid intersection problem and system of strongly possible keys is established.","authors":["Munqath Alattar","Attila Sali"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-28730-6_3","In book: Advances in Databases and Information Systems (pp.33-50)","Project: Incomplete Databases"],"references":["303848496_Possible_and_certain_keys_for_SQL","250806217_Experimental_analysis_of_methods_for_imputation_of_missing_values_in_databases","226731770_The_Treatment_of_Missing_Values_and_its_Effect_on_Classifier_Accuracy","220473818_Design_by_example_for_SQL_table_definitions_with_functional_dependencies","220460037_On_Codd_Families_of_Keys_over_Incomplete_Relations","220431370_On_the_Structure_of_Armstrong_Relations_for_Functional_Dependencies","220430820_Horn_clauses_and_database_dependencies","324512144_SQL_Schema_Design_Foundations_Normal_Forms_and_Normalization","308732916_Imputing_missing_values_using_Inverse_Distance_Weighted_Interpolation_for_time_series_data","303051451_A_comparison_of_several_approches_to_missing_attribute_values_in_data_mining","261041289_Comparison_of_missing_data_imputation_methods_for_traffic_flow","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","227037929_Matroid_intersection_algorithms","222543848_Impact_of_imputation_of_missing_values_on_classification_error_for_discrete_data","222506513_Axiomatisation_of_functional_dependencies_in_incomplete_relations","221464446_Codd_Table_Representations_under_Weak_Possible_World_Semantics","220688502_The_Relational_Model_for_Database_Management_Version_2","220688473_The_Design_of_Relational_Databases","220509291_A_Novel_Framework_for_Imputation_of_Missing_Values_in_Databases","220432097_On_the_Equivalence_of_Database_Models","220123414_Keys_and_Armstrong_Databases_in_Trees_with_Restructuring","220073016_Missing_Is_Useful'_Missing_Values_in_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Trees","4310216_Improving_Relational_Database_Quality_Based_on_Adaptive_Learning_Method_for_Estimating_Null_Value","3412667_A_novel_framework_for_imputation_of_missing_values_in_databases_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_Part_A_Syst_Humans"]}
