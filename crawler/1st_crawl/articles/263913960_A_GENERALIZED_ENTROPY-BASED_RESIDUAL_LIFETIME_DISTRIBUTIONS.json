{"id":"263913960_A_GENERALIZED_ENTROPY-BASED_RESIDUAL_LIFETIME_DISTRIBUTIONS","abstract":"The present communication considers Havrda and Charvat entropy measure to propose a generalized dynamic information measure. It is shown that the proposed measure determines the survival function uniquely. The residual lifetime distributions have been characterized. A bound for the dynamic entropy measure in terms of mean residual life function has been derived, and its monotonicity property is studied.","authors":["Vikaskumar","Hc Taneja"],"meta":["November 2011International Journal of Biomathematics 04(02)","DOI:10.1142/S1793524511001416"],"references":["226878582_Some_Results_on_Residual_Entropy_Function","226805234_Possible_generalization_of_Boltzmann-Gibbs_statistics","1936300_Nonextensive_statistical_mechanics_A_brief_introduction","1780625_Thermodynamic_Description_of_the_Relaxation_of_Two-Dimensional_Euler_Turbulence_Using_Tsallis_Statistics","285201382_How_to_measure_uncertainty_about_residual_lifetime","268758599_On_measures_of_relative_useful_information","265562821_Characterization_of_Lifetime_Distributions_Using_Measure_of_Uncertainty","232985632_Burn-In_Models_and_Methods_A_Review","232128602_Quantification_method_of_classification_processes_Concept_of_structural_a_-entropy","231095381_Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics_and_anomalous_diffusion","220553117_When_does_interval_coding_occur","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","38350687_Maximum_dynamic_entropy_models","38350296_Entropy-based_measure_of_uncertainty_in_past_lifetime_distributions","23634030_Residual_entropy_and_its_characterizations_in_terms_of_hazard_function_and_mean_residual_life_function","23632903_Some_results_on_ordering_of_survival_functions_through_uncertainty","13783462_Information_Content_of_Individual_Genetic_Sequences","13229880_Generalized_Nonextensive_Thermodynamics_Applied_to_the_Cosmic_Background_Radiation_in_a_Robertson-Walker_Universe"]}
