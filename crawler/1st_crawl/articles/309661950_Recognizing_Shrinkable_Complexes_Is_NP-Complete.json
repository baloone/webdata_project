{"id":"309661950_Recognizing_Shrinkable_Complexes_Is_NP-Complete","abstract":"We say that a simplicial complex is \"shrinkable\" if there exists a sequence of admissible edge contractions that reduces the complex to a single vertex. We prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a (two-dimensional) simplicial complex is shrinkable. Along the way, we describe examples of contractible complexes that are not shrinkable.","authors":["Dominique Attali","Olivier Devillers","Marc Glisse","Sylvain Lazard"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.20382/jocg.v7i1a18"],"references":["284024042_The_irreducible_triangulations_of_the_torus","248117036_Topological_estimation_using_witness_complexes","244256415_Topological_Approximation_by_Small_Simplicial_Complexes","284948191_A_polyhedron_without_diagonals","281328351_Transversal_Helly_numbers_pinning_theorems_and_projection_of_simplicial_complexes","269996341_Progressive_Meshes","268497772_A_Course_in_Simple_Homotopy_Theory","260993173_On_the_embeddability_of_contractible_complexes","247580269_Some_aspects_of_the_topology_of_3-manifolds_related_to_the_Poincarmao_conjecture","239536314_Surface_simplification_using_quadric_error_bounds"]}
