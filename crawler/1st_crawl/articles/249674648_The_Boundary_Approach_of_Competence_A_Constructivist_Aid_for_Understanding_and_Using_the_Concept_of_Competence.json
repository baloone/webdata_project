{"id":"249674648_The_Boundary_Approach_of_Competence_A_Constructivist_Aid_for_Understanding_and_Using_the_Concept_of_Competence","abstract":"Although competence is an important concept in human resource development and education, there is no theoretical framework for competence. This article focuses on the development of such a theoretical framework. It proposes the boundary approach ofcompetence, an aid to support human resource managers and educationalists in thinking about the concept of competence and in defining it properly. Here, the concept of competence is being explored by focusing on its dimensions and by identifying differences with related terms. The boundary approach of competence heavily depends on a constructivist point ofview. This holds that the quest for one absolute meaning of competence is being abandoned and that instead competence definitions are being valued against their degree of viability. This article proposes three variables for enhancing viability: people, goal and context.","authors":["Angela Stoof","Rob L Martens","Jeroen J. G. Van Merrienboer","Theo J.
