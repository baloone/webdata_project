{"id":"275588323_Information_Complexity_and_the_Quest_for_Interactive_Compression_A_Survey","abstract":"Information complexity is the interactive analogue of Shannon's classical\ninformation theory. In recent years this field has emerged as a powerful tool\nfor proving strong communication lower bounds, and for addressing some of the\nmajor open problems in communication complexity and circuit complexity. A\nnotable achievement of information complexity is the breakthrough in\nunderstanding of the fundamental direct sum and direct product conjectures,\nwhich aim to quantify the power of parallel computation. This survey provides a\nbrief introduction to information complexity, and overviews some of the recent\nprogress on these conjectures and their tight relationship with the fascinating\nproblem of compressing interactive protocols.","authors":["Omri Weinstein"],"meta":["April 2015ACM SIGACT News 46(2)","DOI:10.1145/2789149.2789161","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262071006_Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_distributed_statistical_estimation_with_communication_constraints","261469585_Towards_a_Reverse_Newman's_Theorem_in_Interactive_Information_Complexity","260345188_From_Information_to_Exact_Communication","258819287_On_the_Communication_Complexity_of_Sparse_Set_Disjointness_and_Exists-Equal_Problems","230779580_A_strong_direct_product_theorem_in_terms_of_the_smooth_rectangle_bound","227309854_Lower_Bounds_on_the_Randomized_Communication_Complexity_of_Read-Once_Functions","222941982_Lower_Bounds_on_Information_Complexity_via_Zero-Communication_Protocols_and_Applications","221590478_Monotone_Circuits_for_Connectivity_Require_Super-Logarithmic_Depth","221580951_A_Direct_Product_Theorem_for_Discrepancy","220780370_On_the_Possibility_of_Faster_SAT_Algorithms","220618283_Computing_with_Noisy_Information","220532929_Monotone_Circuits_for_Connectivity_Require_Super-Logarithmic_Depth","220442328_Limitations_of_VCG-based_mechanisms","220138459_The_Communication_Complexity_of_Correlation","220138239_New_Strong_Direct_Product_Results_in_Communication_Complexity","51963159_A_Discrepancy_Lower_Bound_for_Information_Complexity","45868292_A_Strong_Direct_Product_Theorem_for_Disjointness","288746107_Exponential_Separation_of_Information_and_Communication","288404678_An_Optimal_Lower_Bound_for_Distinct_Elements_in_the_Message_Passing_Model","288162514_Toward_better_formula_lower_bounds_An_information_complexity_approach_to_the_KRW_composition_conjecture","281980233_Communication_complexity_of_approximate_matching_in_distributed_graphs","271554092_A_hard-to-compress_interactive_task","267943573_Beating_the_Direct_Sum_Theorem_in_Communication_Complexity_with_Implications_for_Sketching","262289301_Multiplying_matrices_faster_than_Coppersmith-Winograd","262161078_Parallel_repetition_Simplifications_and_the_no-signaling_case","261268028_A_Direct_Product_Theorem_for_the_Two-Party_Bounded-Round_Public-Coin_Communication_Complexity","261054438_Common_Information_and_Unique_Disjointness","246047425_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_Series_in_Telecommunication","236871631_A_Tight_Bound_for_Set_Disjointness_in_the_Message-Passing_Model","234005710_Superlinear_Lower_Bounds_for_Multipass_Graph_Processing","232633811_Amortized_communication_complexity_PDF","232628585_On_ACC_circuit_complexity_PDF","226831896_Super-logarithmic_depth_lower_bounds_via_the_direct_sum_in_communication_complexity","225338470_A_method_for_the_construction_of_minimum-redundancy_codes","222431754_An_Information_Statistics_Approach_to_Data_Stream_and_Communication_Complexity","221591676_Some_Complexity_Questions_Related_to_Distributive_Computing_Preliminary_Report","221590591_How_to_Compress_Interactive_Communication","221590180_Limitations_of_VCG-based_mechanisms","221498145_Theory_and_Applications_of_Trapdoor_Functions_Extended_Abstract","221034360_Area_Time_Squared_and_Area_Complexity_of_VLSI_Computations_is_Strongly_Unclosed_Under_Union_and_Intersection","220616444_Amortized_Communication_Complexity","220411114_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","220139115_Property_Testing_Lower_Bounds_Via_Communication_Complexity","220138429_Parallel_Repetition_in_Projection_Games_and_a_Concentration_Bound","220138207_Interactive_Information_Complexity","220058934_A_Simple_Proof_of_Bazzi's_Theorem","200034021_Elements_of_Information_Theory","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","51912125_Information_Equals_Amortized_Communication","47820452_Strong_Direct_Product_Theorems_for_Quantum_Communication_and_Query_Complexity","4257934_The_Communication_Complexity_of_Correlation","43334628_On_the_Communication_Complexity_of_Read-Once_AC0_Formulae","4023773_Near-optimal_lower_bounds_on_the_multi-party_communication_complexity_of_set_disjointness","3921142_Informational_Complexity_and_the_Direct_Sum_Problem_for_Simultaneous_Message_Complexity","3510329_On_ACC_circuit_complexity"]}
