{"id":"299657197_Approximation_by_p_q-Lorentz_Polynomials_on_a_Compact_Disk","abstract":"The (p, q)-factors were introduced in order to generalize or unify several forms of q-oscillator algebras well known in the physics literature related to the representation theory of single parameter quantum algebras. This notion has been recently used in approximation by positive linear operators via (p, q)-calculus which has emerged a very active area of research. In this paper, we introduce a new analogue of Lorentz polynomials based on (p, q)-integers. We obtain quantitative estimate in the Voronovskajaâ€™s type theorem and exact orders in simultaneous approximation by the complex (p, q)-Lorentz polynomials of degree (Formula presented.) ((Formula presented.), attached to analytic functions on compact disks of the complex plane. In this way, we put in evidence the overconvergence phenomenon for the (p, q)-Lorentz polynomial, namely the extensions of approximation properties (with quantitative estimates) from real intervals to compact disks in the complex plane.","authors":["Mohammad Mursaleen","Faisal Khan","Asif Khan"],"meta":["December 2016Complex Analysis and Operator Theory 10(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11785-016-0553-4"],"references":["302403395_Some_approximation_results_on_Bleimann-Butzer-Hahn_operators_defined_by_p_q-integers","292963248_On_a_Kantorovich_Variant_of_pq-Szasz-Mirakjan_Operators","290393589_On_Kantorovich_modification_of_pq-Baskakov_operators","288666799_pq-Szasz-Mirakyan-Baskakov_operators","281458804_pq-Generalization_of_Szasz-Mirakyan_Operators","280921340_Some_approximation_results_on_Bernstein-Schurer_operators_defined_by_p_q-integers","288058661_On_p_q-analogue_of_Kantorovich_type_Bernstein-Stancu-Schurer_operators","284124069_On_p_q-generalization_of_Szasz-Mirakyan_Kantorovich_operators","279450369_On_p_q-analogue_of_Bernstein_operators","277075324_Some_approximation_results_by_pq-analogue_of_Bernstein-Stancu_operators"]}
