{"id":"328566643_Review_on_self-embedding_fragile_watermarking_for_image_authentication_and_self-recovery","abstract":"As the major source of information, digital images play an indispensable role in our lives. However, with the development of image processing techniques, people can optionally retouch or even forge an image by using image processing software. Therefore, the authenticity and integrity of digital images are facing severe challenge. To resolve this issue, the fragile watermarking schemes for image authentication have been proposed. According to different purposes, the fragile watermarking can be divided into two categories: fragile watermarking for tamper localization and fragile watermarking with recovery ability. The fragile watermarking for image tamper localization can only identify and locate the tampered regions, but it cannot further restore the modified regions. In some cases, image recovery for tampered regions is very essential. Generally, the fragile watermarking for image authentication and recovery includes three procedures: watermark generation and embedding, tamper localization, and image self-recovery. In this article, we make a review on self-embedding fragile watermarking methods. The basic model and the evaluation indexes of this watermarking scheme are presented in this paper. Some related works proposed in recent years and their advantages and disadvantages are described in detail to help the future research in this field. Based on the analysis, we give the future research prospects and suggestions in the end.","authors":["C. Wang","H. Zhang","X.
