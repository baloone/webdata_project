{"id":"264984988_Piecewise-Planar_3D_Reconstruction_with_Edge_and_Corner_Regularization","abstract":"This paper presents a method for the 3D reconstruction of a piecewise-planar surface from range images, typically laser scans with millions of points. The reconstructed surface is a watertight polygonal mesh that conforms to observations at a given scale in the visible planar parts of the scene, and that is plausible in hidden parts. We formulate surface reconstruction as a discrete optimization problem based on detected and hypothesized planes. One of our major contributions, besides a treatment of data anisotropy and novel surface hypotheses, is a regularization of the reconstructed surface w.r.t. the length of edges and the number of corners. Compared to classical area-based regularization, it better captures surface complexity and is therefore better suited for man-made environments, such as buildings. To handle the underlying higher-order potentials, that are problematic for MRF optimizers, we formulate minimization as a sparse mixed-integer linear programming problem and obtain an approximate solution using a simple relaxation. Experiments show that it is fast and reaches near-optimal solutions.","authors":["Alexandre Boulch","Martin de la gorce","Renaud Marlet"],"meta":["August 2014Computer Graphics Forum 33(5)","DOI:10.1111/cgf.12431"],"references":["278798250_State_of_the_Art_in_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Point_Clouds","264318369_Surface_Reconstruction_through_Point_Set_Structuring","261226306_A_Comparative_Study_of_Modern_Inference_Techniques_for_Discrete_Energy_Minimization_Problems","257406731_Segmentation_of_discrete_point_clouds_using_an_extensible_set_of_templates","235779989_O-Snap_Optimization-Based_Snapping_for_Modeling_Architecture","228939744_Automatic_3d_Modelling_Of_Indoor_Manhattan-world_Scenes_From_Laser_Data","221363468_Manhattan-world_stereo","221110455_Curvature_Regularity_for_Region-based_Image_Segmentation_and_Inpainting_A_Linear_Programming_Relaxation","220839033_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Fitted_Shape_Primitives","220183962_GlobFit_Consistently_Fitting_Primitives_by_Discovering_Global_Relations","51935732_Curvature_Prior_for_MRF-Based_Segmentation_and_Shape_Inpainting","44596505_Markov_random_field_surface_reconstruction_IEEE_Trans_Vis_Comput_Graph","3961980_Improving_environment_modelling_by_edge_occlusion_surface_completion","313513923_Reconstructing_building_interiors_from_images","278747266_Statistical_Criteria_for_Shape_Fusion_and_Selection","263299499_Watertight_Scenes_from_Urban_LiDAR_and_Planar_Surfaces","262334030_Fast_and_Robust_Normal_Estimation_for_Point_Clouds_with_Sharp_Features","236969236_Semantizing_Complex_3D_Scenes_using_Constrained_Attribute_Grammars","232631796_Manhattan-world_stereo","224339625_Fast_Plane_Detection_and_Polygonalization_in_Noisy_3D_Range_Images","224135898_Reconstructing_Building_Interiors_from_Images","221792554_Automatic_Extraction_of_Manhattan-World_Building_Masses_from_3D_Laser_Range_Scans","221364112_Robust_Piecewise-Planar_3D_Reconstruction_and_Completion_from_Large-Scale_Unstructured_Point_Data","220728733_Curvature_Regularization_for_Curves_and_Surfaces_in_a_Global_Optimization_Framework","220660250_Architectural_Modeling_from_Sparsely_Scanned_Range_Data","220506388_Completion_and_Reconstruction_with_Primitive_Shapes","220505939_Efficient_RANSAC_for_point-cloud_shape_detection","8337762_What_Energy_Functions_Can_Be_Minimized_via_Graph_Cuts"]}
