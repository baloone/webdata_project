{"id":"322936983_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_Exponential_Curve","abstract":"Beyond the representation of numerical data on a pair of variables by polynomial curve, whose development has arrived at a significant stage, it can be possible to represent the said numerical data by non-polynomial curve. In this study, attempt has been made on the representation of numerical data on a pair of variables by a non-polynomial curve namely\nexponential curve. This paper describes the method of representing numerical data on a pair of variables by exponential curve with numerical example in order to show the application of the method to numerical data.","authors":["Dhritikesh Chakrabarty","Biswajit Das"],"meta":["June 2017","Project: Ph.D. Research"],"references":["322937034_Testing_of_Proper_Randomness_of_the_Numbers_Generated_by_Kendall_and_Babington_Smith_t-Test","322917090_Examination_of_Proper_Randomness_of_the_Numbers_Generated_by_LHC_Tippett_1927","322917071_Examination_of_Proper_Randomness_of_the_Number_Generated_by_L_H_C_Tippett","322916905_Testing_of_Randomness_of_the_Number_Generated_by_Fisher_and_Yates","322862305_Testing_of_Randomness_of_the_Numbers_Generated_by_Fisher_and_Yates_Run_Test","322862179_Examination_of_Proper_Randomness_of_the_Numbers_Generated_by_Rand_Corporation_1955_Random_Number_Table_t-Test","322820909_Determination_of_Parameter_from_Observation_Containing_itself_and_Chance_Error_Central_Tendency_of_Annual_Extremum_of_Ambient_Air_Temperature_at_Dhubri","330511335_Dependability_of_Fault-Tolerant_Systems-Explicit_Modeling_of_the_Interactions_Between_Hardware_and_Software_Components","324638190_The_Maximum_Order_of_an_Element_of_a_Finite_Symmetric_Group","316937352_Probability_and_Statistics_with_Reliability_Queuing_and_Computer_Science_Applications","271722808_Common_Fixed_Points_of_Locally_Contractive_Mappings_in_Multiplicative_Metric_Spaces_with_Application","271231043_Common_fixed_points_for_weak_commutative_mappings_on_a_multiplicative_metric_space","271201417_Some_Unique_Fixed_Point_Theorems_in_Multiplicative_Metric_Spaces","280939880_Hardware-Related_Software_Errors_Measurement_and_Analysis","275983087_A_Course_in_Tensors_with_Applications_to_Riemannian_Geometry"]}
