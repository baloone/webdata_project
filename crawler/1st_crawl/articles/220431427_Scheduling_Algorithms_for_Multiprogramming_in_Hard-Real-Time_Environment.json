{"id":"220431427_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multiprogramming_in_Hard-Real-Time_Environment","abstract":"The problem of multiprogram scheduling on a single processor is studied from the viewpoint of the characteristics peculiar to the program functions that need guaranteed service. It is shown that an optimum fixed priority scheduler possesses an upper bound to processor utilization which may be as low as 70 percent for large task sets. It is also shown that full processor utilization can be achieved by dynamically assigning priorities on the basis of their current deadlines. A combination of these two scheduling techniques is also discussed.","authors":["C.L. Liu","James W.
