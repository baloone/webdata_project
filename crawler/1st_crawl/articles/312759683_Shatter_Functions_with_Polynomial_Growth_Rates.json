{"id":"312759683_Shatter_Functions_with_Polynomial_Growth_Rates","abstract":"We study how a single value of the shatter function of a set system restricts its asymptotic growth. Along the way, we refute a conjecture of Bondy and Hajnal which generalizes Sauer's Lemma.","authors":["Boris Bukh","Xavier Goaoc"],"meta":["January 2017SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 33(2)","DOI:10.1137/17M1113680"],"references":["305471047_Rational_exponents_for_hypergraph_Turan_problems","316349627_On_the_uniform_convergence_of_relative_frequencies_of_events_to_their_probabilities","312719153_Traces_of_finite_sets_Extremal_problems_and_geometric_applications","279068669_Rational_exponents_in_extremal_graph_theory","266438516_Geometric_Set_Systems","233784971_On_the_Uniform_Convergence_of_Relative_Frequencies_of_Events_to_Their_Probabilities","222784754_On_the_density_of_sets_of_vectors","222618644_On_the_trace_of_finite_sets","220079198_On_the_Density_of_Families_of_Sets","220074547_Defect_Sauer_Results"]}
