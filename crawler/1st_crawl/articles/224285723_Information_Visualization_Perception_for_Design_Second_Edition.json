{"id":"224285723_Information_Visualization_Perception_for_Design_Second_Edition","abstract":"Most designers know that yellow text presented against a blue background reads clearly and easily, but how many can explain why, and what really are the best ways to help others and ourselves clearly see key patterns in a bunch of data? This book explores the art and science of why we see objects the way we do. Based on the science of perception and vision, the author presents the key principles at work for a wide range of applications--resulting in visualization of improved clarity, utility, and persuasiveness. The book offers practical guidelines that can be applied by anyone: interaction designers, graphic designers of all kinds (including web designers), data miners, and financial analysts.","authors":["Colin Ware"],"meta":["April 2004","Publisher: Morgan Kaufmann"],"references":["313554067_The_silk_cursor_Investigating_transparency_for_3D_target_acquisition","296484623_An_Introduction_to_the_Human_Applications_Standard_Computer_Interface_Part_1_Theory_and_Principles","313515392_Pictorial_recognition_in_subjects_from_a_relatively_pictureless_environment","286288689_Exploring_and_Finding_Information","285641197_The_phantom_haptic_interface_A_device_for_probing_virtual_objects_ASME_haptic_interfaces_for_virtual_environments_and_teleoperator_systems","275454966_Dynamic_Viewpoint_Tethering_for_Navigation_in_Large-scale_Virtual_Environments","250729600_Fast_hill_shading_with_cast_shadows","250196206_Visual_Search_Processes_Used_in_Map_Reading","250015876_Predicting_Visual_Clusters_on_Graduated_Circle_Maps","249179152_Signs_of_the_Origin_of_Syntax","245973978_Drawings_on_napkins_video-game_animation_and_other_ways_to_program_computers","242506093_The_Face_as_a_Data_Display","243840735_Prediction_of_simultaneous_contrast_between_map_colors_with_Hunt's_model_of_color_appearance","242710057_Chapter_2_Attention_and_Visual_Perception_Analyzing_Divided_Attention","242530106_An_Empirical_Inquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding_of_Two-Variable_Color_Maps"]}
