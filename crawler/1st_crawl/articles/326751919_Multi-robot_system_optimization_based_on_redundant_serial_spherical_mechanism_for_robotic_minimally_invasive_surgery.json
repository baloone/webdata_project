{"id":"326751919_Multi-robot_system_optimization_based_on_redundant_serial_spherical_mechanism_for_robotic_minimally_invasive_surgery","abstract":"Serial spherical linkages have been used in the design of a number of robots for minimally invasive surgery, in order to mechanically constrain the surgical instrument with respect to the incision. However, the typical serial spherical mechanism suffers from conflicting design objectives, resulting in an unsuitable compromise between avoiding collision with the patient and producing good kinematic and workspace characteristics. In this paper, we propose a multi-robot system composed of two redundant serial spherical linkages to achieve this purpose. A multi-objective optimization for achieving the aforementioned design goals is presented first for a single redundant robot and then for a multi-robot system. The problem of mounting multiple robots on the operating table as well as the way cooperative actions can be performed is addressed. The sensitivity of each optimal solution (single-robot and multi-robot) to uncertainties in the design parameters is investigated.","authors":["C. A. Nelson","med amine Laribi","S.
