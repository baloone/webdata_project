{"id":"341145359_Autonomous_Tuning_and_Charge-State_Detection_of_Gate-Defined_Quantum_Dots","abstract":"Defining quantum dots in semiconductor-based heterostructures is an essential step in initializing solid-state qubits. With growing device complexity and increasing number of functional devices required for measurements, a manual approach to finding suitable gate voltages to confine electrons electrostatically is impractical. Here, we implement a two-stage device characterization and dot-tuning process, which first determines whether devices are functional and then attempts to tune the functional devices to the single or double quantum-dot regime. We show that automating well-established manual-tuning procedures and replacing the experimenter’s decisions by supervised machine learning is sufficient to tune double quantum dots in multiple devices without premeasured input or manual intervention. The quality of measurement results and charge states are assessed by four binary classifiers trained with experimental data, reflecting real device behavior. We compare and optimize eight models and different data preprocessing techniques for each of the classifiers to achieve reliable autonomous tuning, an essential step towards scalable quantum systems in quantum-dot-based qubit architectures.","authors":["J.
