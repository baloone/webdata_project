{"id":"22367690_Diagnosis_of_acute_abdominal_pain_with_computer_analysis","abstract":"The diagnosis of the causes of acute abdominal pain can be improved by means of structured case notes, by education in differential diagnosis, and by feedback of information. Medical audit by computer analysis showed an increase in the percentage of patients discharged from an Accident and Emergency Department, a decrease in the number of unnecessary laparotomies, and an increase in the discriminatory accuracy between diagnostic alternatives. Diagnosis by computer analysis proved to be about 10% more accurate.","authors":["A A Gunn"],"meta":["June 1976Journal of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh 21(3):170-2","SourcePubMed"],"references":[]}
