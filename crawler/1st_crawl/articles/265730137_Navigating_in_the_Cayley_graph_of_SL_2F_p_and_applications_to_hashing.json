{"id":"265730137_Navigating_in_the_Cayley_graph_of_SL_2F_p_and_applications_to_hashing","abstract":"Cayley hash functions are based on a simple idea of using a pair of\n(semi)group elements, $A$ and $B$, to hash the 0 and 1 bit, respectively, and\nthen to hash an arbitrary bit string in the natural way, by using\nmultiplication of elements in the (semi)group. In this paper, we focus on\nhashing with $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $F_p$. Since there are many known pairs\nof $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $Z$ that generate a free monoid, this yields\nnumerous pairs of matrices over $F_p$, for a sufficiently large prime $p$, that\nare candidates for collision-resistant hashing. However, this trick can\n\"backfire\", and lifting matrix entries to $Z$ may facilitate finding a\ncollision. This \"lifting attack\" was successfully used by Tillich and Z\\'emor\nin the special case where two matrices $A$ and $B$ generate (as a monoid) the\nwhole monoid $SL_2(Z_+)$. However, in this paper we show that the situation\nwith other, \"similar\", pairs of matrices from $SL_2(Z)$ is different, and the\n\"lifting attack\" can (in some cases) produce collisions in the group generated\nby $A$ and $B$, but not in the positive monoid. Therefore, we argue that for\nthese pairs of matrices, there are no known attacks at this time that would\naffect security of the corresponding hash functions. We also give explicit\nlower bounds on the length of collisions for hash functions corresponding to\nsome particular pairs of matrices from $SL_2(F_p)$.","authors":["Lisa Bromberg","Vladimir Shpilrain","Alina Vdovina"],"meta":["September 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["279262111_Analysis_of_cryptographic_hash_functions","220334155_Rubik's_for_cryptographers","44795388_VSH_an_Efficient_and_Provable_Collision_Resistant_Hash_Function","285368375_A_property_of_a_representation_of_a_free_group","265542044_Word_Processing_in_Groups","245942755_Discrete_Groups_Expanding_Graphs_and_Invariant_Measures","243116729_Uniform_expansion_bounds_for_Cayley_graphs_of_SL_2_p","242351880_Navigating_the_Cayley_graph_of_SL2Fp","238676901_Explicit_Construction_of_Concentrators","221508323_Group-theoretic_hash_functions"]}
