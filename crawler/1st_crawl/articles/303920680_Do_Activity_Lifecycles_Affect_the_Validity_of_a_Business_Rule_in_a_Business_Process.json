{"id":"303920680_Do_Activity_Lifecycles_Affect_the_Validity_of_a_Business_Rule_in_a_Business_Process","abstract":"Traditional process mining techniques offer limited possibilities to analyze business processes working in low-predictable and dynamic environments. Recently, to close this gap, declarative process models have been introduced to represent process mining results since they allow for describing complex behaviors as a compact set of business rules. However, in this context, activities of a business process are still considered as atomic/instantaneous events. This is a strong limitation for these approaches because often, in realistic environments, process activities are not instantaneous but executed across a time interval and pass through a sequence of states of a lifecycle. This paper investigates how the existing techniques for the discovery of declarative process models can be adapted when the business process under analysis contains non-atomic activities. In particular, we base our proposed approach on the use of discriminative rule mining to determine how the characteristics of the activity lifecycles in a business process influence the validity of a business rule in that process. The approach has been implemented as a plug-in of the process mining tool ProM and validated on synthetic logs and on a real-life log recorded by an incident and problem management system called VINST in use at Volvo IT Belgium","authors":["Mario Luca Bernardi","Marta Cimitile","Chiara Di Francescomarino","Fabrizio Maria Maggi"],"meta":["June 2016Information Systems 62","DOI:10.1016/j.is.2016.06.002"],"references":["316686458_Discovering_Target-Branched_Declare_Constraints","313900571_Log-Based_Understanding_of_Business_Processes_through_Temporal_Logic_Query_Checking","279896778_Rediscovering_Workflow_Models_from_Event-Based_Data_using_Little_Thumb","276164466_On_the_Discovery_of_Declarative_Control_Flows_for_Artful_Processes","269629902_Knowledge-Intensive_Processes_Characteristics_Requirements_and_Analysis_of_Contemporary_Approaches","266597311_Discovering_Target-Branched_Declare_Constraints","266557044_User-Guided_Discovery_of_Declarative_Process_Models","265383413_Discovering_Cross-Organizational_Business_Rules_from_the_Cloud","262515051_Using_Discriminative_Rule_Mining_to_Discover_Declarative_Process_Models_with_Non-Atomic_Activities","257924115_Self-Adaptive_Event_Recognition_for_Intelligent_Transport_Management","254461995_Run-time_composite_event_recognition","236629180_A_Two-Step_Fast_Algorithm_for_the_Automated_Discovery_of_Declarative_Workflows","235736605_Towards_Data-Aware_Constraints_in_Declare","228979454_ProM_The_Process_Mining_Toolkit","228947378_Probabilistic_Logic-based_Process_Mining","228946318_Multi-phase_process_mining_Aggregating_instance_graphs_into_EPCs_and_Petri_nets","228058014_Pattern_Classification","226923150_Process_mining_A_two-step_approach_to_balance_between_underfitting_and_overfitting","226194368_Genetic_process_mining_An_experimental_evaluation","225792142_Declarative_workflows_Balancing_between_flexibility_and_support","225164455_Verification_of_Choreographies_During_Execution_Using_the_Reactive_Event_Calculus","221653698_Classification_of_Software_Behaviors_for_Failure_Detection_A_Discriminative_Pattern_Mining_Approach","221586322_Inducing_Declarative_Logic-Based_Models_from_Labeled_Traces","221143476_Probabilistic_Declarative_Process_Mining","220923561_Verification_of_Choreographies_During_Execution_Using_the_Reactive_Event_Calculus","220783652_EMiT_A_process_mining_tool","293805420_Looking_into_the_Future","280546899_Online_Discovery_of_Declarative_Process_Models_from_Event_Streams","273788691_Conformance_Checking_Based_on_Multi-Perspective_Declarative_Process_Models","266557473_Log-Based_Understanding_of_Business_Processes_through_Temporal_Logic_Query_Checking","266557371_Monitoring_Data-Aware_Business_Constraints_with_Finite_State_Automata","266557294_Discovering_Metric_Temporal_Business_Constraints_from_Event_Logs","266557210_Declarative_Process_Mining_with_the_Declare_Component_of_ProM","262309444_Mining_explicit_rules_for_software_process_evaluation","256406249_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","256405917_Looking_Into_the_Future_Using_Timed_Automata_to_Provide_A_Priori_Advice_about_Timed_Declarative_Process_Models","256405631_Enhancing_Declare_Maps_Based_on_Event_Correlations","256198927_Discovering_Data-Aware_Declarative_Process_Models_from_Event_Logs","254331969_Newton-Raphson_and_Related_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Likelihood_Variance_Component_Estimation","245588501_Jorge_B_Bocca_and_Matthias_Jarke_and_Carlo_Zaniolo","241849731_Process_mining_in_the_largepreprocessing_discovery_and_diagnostics","235949998_XES_Standard_Definition","235736569_Monitoring_Business_Constraints_with_the_Event_Calculus","233073392_Techniques_for_A_Posteriori_Analysis_of_Declarative_Processes","229125331_Efficient_Discovery_of_Understandable_Declarative_Process_Models_from_Event_Logs","229124352_Multi-Phase_Mining_Aggregating_Instances_Graphs_into_EPCs_and_Petri_Nets","221900765_Fast_Algorithms_for_Mining_Association_Rules_in_Large_Databases","221475232_Applying_Inductive_Logic_Programming_to_Process_Mining","221165528_Heuristics_Miner_for_Time_Intervals","221103529_Mining_closed_discriminative_dyadic_sequential_patterns","220613586_Verifiable_agent_interaction_in_abductive_logic_programming_The_SCIFF_framework","220593850_Declarative_specification_and_verification_of_service_choreographies","220451684_Mining_process_models_with_non-free-choice_Constructs","220693003_Process_Mining_Discovery_Conformance_and_Enhancement_of_Business_Processes","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning"]}
