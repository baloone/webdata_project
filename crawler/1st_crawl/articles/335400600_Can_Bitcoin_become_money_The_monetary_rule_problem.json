{"id":"335400600_Can_Bitcoin_become_money_The_monetary_rule_problem","abstract":"The growing literature on Bitcoin can be divided into two groups. One performs an economic analysis of Bitcoin focusing on its monetary characteristics. The other one takes a financial look at the price of Bitcoin. Interestingly, both of these groups have not given much more than passing comments to the problem of whether or not Bitcoin has the right monetary rule in order to become a well‚Äêestablished currency. This paper argues that Bitcoin in particular, and cryptocurrencies in general, do not have a good monetary rule and that this shortcoming seriously limits its prospect of becoming widely used money.","authors":["Nicolas Cachanosky"],"meta":["August 2019Australian Economic Papers 58(2)","DOI:10.1111/1467-8454.12158"],"references":["333278197_What's_Holding_Back_Blockchain_Finance_On_the_Possibility_of_Decentralized_Autonomous_Finance","305396886_Bitcoin_and_entrepreneurship_breaking_the_network_effect","24088321_Post_Keynesian_Approaches_to_Endogenous_Money_A_time_framework_explanation","345643946_Monetary_Equilibrium_and_Nominal_Income_Targeting","344474180_Bank_Deregulation_Monetary_Order","333734016_Is_Bitcoin_Money_And_What_that_Means","333051667_Data_Money_The_Socio-Technical_Infrastructure_of_Cryptocurrency_Blockchains","331314223_The_Socio-Technological_Lives_of_Bitcoin","330961799_Nominal_GDP_Targeting_and_the_Taylor_Rule_on_an_Even_Playing_Field","328473334_The_Case_for_Nominal_GDP_Targeting","328471590_A_Market-Driven_Nominal_GDP_Targeting_Regime","326815368_Getting_off_the_ground_The_case_of_bitcoin","322923160_Price_discovery_of_cryptocurrencies_Bitcoin_and_beyond","322643032_What_was_Bitcoin_what_will_it_be_The_techno-economic_imaginaries_of_a_new_money_technology","319993552_The_inefficiency_of_Bitcoin_revisited_A_dynamic_approach","318896839_Price_clustering_in_Bitcoin","318874909_Is_Bitcoin_Intrinsically_Worthless","318373290_Banning_Bitcoin","317997010_Nominal_GDP_Targeting_and_the_Taylor_Rule_on_an_Even_Playing_Field","317881677_Bitcoin_and_Potosi_Silver_Historical_Perspectives_on_Cryptocurrency","315641944_War_Money_Economy_Economic_Performance_in_the_Fed_and_Pre-Fed_Periods","314481024_Crypto-Currency_and_the_Problem_of_Intermediation","313612322_The_Social_Life_of_Bitcoin","313242640_Can_Bitcoin_Become_a_Major_Currency","313237782_Bitcoin_and_the_Bailout","311922243_Is_bitcoin_a_real_currency_An_economic_appraisal","309521258_On_the_inefficiency_of_Bitcoin","309513828_CRYPTOCURRENCIES_NETWORK_EFFECTS_AND_SWITCHING_COSTS","308571611_The_Inefficiency_of_Bitcoin","307551962_Decentralized_Banking_Monetary_Technocracy_in_the_Digital_Age","291072549_The_Endogenous_Money_Supply","283974377_The_political_economy_of_bitcoin","283431369_Bitcoin_will_bite_the_dust","275675913_The_Theory_of_Money_and_Credit","273834841_The_Productivity_Gap_Monetary_Policy_the_Subprime_Boom_and_the_Post-2001_Productivity_Surge","273734374_Free_Banking_in_Britain_Theory_Experience_and_Debate_1800-1845","268284353_Bitcoins_as_an_investment_or_speculative_vehicle_A_first_look","263198339_When_perhaps_the_real_problem_is_money_itself_The_practical_materiality_of_Bitcoin","256012689_Synthetic_Commodity_Money","254455303_Endogenous_Money_Implications_for_the_Money_Supply_Process_Interest_Rates_and_Macroeconomics","248182788_Two_Theories_of_Money_Supply_Endogeneity_Some_Empirical_Evidence","228640975_Bitcoin_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System","35943259_The_theory_of_free_banking_a_study_of_the_supply_of_money_under_competitive_note_issue","23779995_Ideal_Money","5220372_Milton_Friedman_and_the_Monetarist_Counter-Revolution_A_Re-appraisal","5168850_The_Competitive_Supply_of_Money","4889649_Currency_Competition_Network_Externalities_and_Switching_Costs_Towards_an_Alternative_View_of_Optimum_Currency_Areas"]}
