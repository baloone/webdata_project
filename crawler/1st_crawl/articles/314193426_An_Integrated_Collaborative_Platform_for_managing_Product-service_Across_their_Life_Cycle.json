{"id":"314193426_An_Integrated_Collaborative_Platform_for_managing_Product-service_Across_their_Life_Cycle","abstract":"Product-Service System (PSS) design methodologies have been extensively researched during the past years. Various tools and methods have been established for the incorporation of sustainability and system-oriented lifecycle thinking in the design of PSS. This paper presents an integrated collaborative platform that aspires to conceptualize a new landscape of modular product-services that will be tracked throughout their lifecycle using a network of smart sensors enabling the extraction of useful value. The concept is based on a series of distinct components supported by a common semantic knowledge base, enabling the seamless collaboration of partners of multiple disciplines for the realization of product-services. Moreover, a set of services are used, which are integrated with the sensor network to return information about the performance of the PSS to the customers and the product designer, supporting them in the decision making process. Finally, an application of the proposed methodology in an industrial scenario is presented.","authors":["Markos Matsas","George Pintzos","Anna Kapnia","Dimitris Mourtzis"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia CIRP 59:220-226","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2016.09.009","Project: ICP4Life (Horizon 2020)"],"references":["344726772_Automatic_Multiple_Sensor_Data_Acquisition_System_in_a_Real-time_Production_Environment","310467817_PSS_Design_Evaluation_via_KPIs_and_Lean_Design_Assistance_Supported_by_Context_Sensitivity_Tools","294890363_PSS_Design_Evaluation_via_KPIs_and_Lean_Design_assistance_supported_by_the_Context_Sensitivity_tools","283981496_Sources_and_Characteristics_of_Information_about_Product_Use","281115948_Performance_Indicators_for_the_Evaluation_of_Product-Service_Systems_Design_A_Review","277349232_Who_Realizes_a_PSS_An_Organizational_Framework_for_PSS_Development","276298919_Investigating_Sustainability_Assessment_Methods_of_Product-service_Systems","344064241_Manufacturing_Systems_Theory_and_Practice","280892526_Innovation_in_life_cycle_engineering_and_sustainable_development","276378153_Cloud-Based_Platform_for_Optimal_Machining_Parameter_Selection_Based_on_Function_Blocks_and_Real-Time_Monitoring"]}
