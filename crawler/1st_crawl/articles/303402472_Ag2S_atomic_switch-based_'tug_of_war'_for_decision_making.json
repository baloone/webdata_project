{"id":"303402472_Ag2S_atomic_switch-based_'tug_of_war'_for_decision_making","abstract":"For a computing process such as making a decision, a software controlled chip of several transistors is necessary. Inspired by how a single cell amoeba decides its movements, the theoretical 'tug of war' computing model was proposed but not yet implemented in an analogue device suitable for integrated circuits. Based on this model, we now developed a new electronic element for decision making processes, which will have no need for prior programming. The devices are based on the growth and shrinkage of Ag filaments in α-Ag2+δS gap-type atomic switches. Here we present the adapted device design and the new materials. We demonstrate the basic 'tug of war' operation by IV-measurements and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation. These devices could be the base for a CMOS-free new computer architecture.","authors":["Carolin Lutz","T Hasegawa","Toyohiro Chikyow"],"meta":["May 2016Nanoscale 8(29)","DOI:10.1039/c6nr00690f","Project: Atomic Switch Based Tug of War"],"references":["281036033_Single-photon_decision_maker","280330333_Decision_Maker_based_on_Atomic_Switches","275614425_Sequential_Phase_Transition_during_Fabricating_beta-Ag2S_Film_on_Ag_Electrode_by_Wet_Chemical_Process","269040803_Training_and_Operation_of_an_Integrated_Neuromorphic_Network_Based_on_Metal-Oxide_Memristors","256377499_Volatile_and_nonvolatile_selective_switching_of_a_photo-assisted_initialized_atomic_switch","230864068_A_ferroelectric_memristor","225167231_Memristive_operations_demonstrated_by_gap-type_atomic_switches","51427850_Memristive_Switching_Mechanism_for_MetalOxideMetal_Nanodevices","51250586_Short_term_plasticity_and_long_term_potentiation_mimicked_in_single_inorganic_synapses","291517677_High-temperature_X-ray_diffraction_and_thermal_expansion_of_nanocrystalline_and_coarse-crystalline_acanthite_a-Ag2S_and_argentite_b-Ag2S","284199927_Moore's_Law_at_Fifty","282156505_Low-current_operations_in_4F2-compatible_Ta2O5-based_complementary_resistive_switches","264269191_A_Polymer-Electrolyte-Based_Atomic_Switch","258133760_Beyond_von-Neumann_Computing_with_Nanoscale_Phase-Change_Memory_Devices","247860618_The_Ag_2_S_and_Ag_2_Se_transitions_as_geologic_thermometers","236234970_Tug-of-war_model_for_the_two-bandit_problem_Nonlocally-correlated_parallel_exploration_via_resource_conservation","234958505_Formation_and_disappearance_of_a_nanoscale_silver_cluster_realized_by_solid_electrochemical_reaction","230823032_P-Conjugated_Polymers_for_Organic_Electronics_and_Photovoltaic_Cell_Applications","221727628_The_Memristive_Magnetic_Tunnel_Junction_as_a_Nanoscopic_Synapse-Neuron_System","216804213_Synaptic_behaviors_and_modeling_of_a_metal_oxide_memristive_device","215446280_Can_Programming_Be_Liberated_from_the_von_Neumann_Style_A_Functional_Style_and_Its_Algebra_of_Programs","51853226_A_Functional_Hybrid_Memristor_Crossbar-ArrayCMOS_System_for_Data_Storage_and_Neuromorphic_Applications","51709337_Atomic_Switch_AtomIon_Movement_Controlled_Devices_for_Beyond_Von-Neumann_Computers","51590162_Short-Term_Memory_to_Long-Term_Memory_Transition_in_a_Nanoscale_Memristor","45186290_Photoassisted_Formation_of_an_Atomic_Switch","41654373_Nanoscale_Memristor_Device_as_Synapse_in_Neuromorphic_Systems","8096649_Quantized_conductance_atomic_switch","5400588_The_Missing_Memristor_Found"]}
