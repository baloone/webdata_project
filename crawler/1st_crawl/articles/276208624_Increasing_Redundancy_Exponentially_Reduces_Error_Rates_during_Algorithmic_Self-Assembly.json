{"id":"276208624_Increasing_Redundancy_Exponentially_Reduces_Error_Rates_during_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly","abstract":"While biology demonstrates that molecules can reliably transfer information and compute, design principles for implementing complex molecular computations in vitro are still being developed. In electronic computers, large-scale computation is made possible by redundancy, which allows errors to be detected and corrected. Increasing the amount of redundancy can exponentially reduce errors. Here, we use algorithmic self-assembly, a generalization of crystal growth in which the self-assembly process executes a program for growing an object, to examine experimentally whether redundancy can analogously reduce the rate at which errors occur during molecular self-assembly. We designed DNA double-crossover molecules to algorithmically self-assemble ribbon crystals that repeatedly copy a short bitstring, and we measured the error rate when each bit is encoded by 1 molecule, or redundantly encoded by 2, 3, or 4 molecules. Under our experimental conditions, each additional level of redundancy decreases the bitwise error rate by a factor of roughly 3, with the 4-redundant encoding yielding an error rate less than 0.1%. While theory and simulation predict that larger improvements in error rates are possible, our results already suggest that by using sufficient redundancy it may be possible to algorithmically self-assemble micrometer-sized objects with programmable, nanometer-scale features.","authors":["Rebecca Schulman","Christina Wright","Erik Winfree"],"meta":["May 2015ACS Nano 9(6)","DOI:10.1021/nn507493s","SourcePubMed"],"references":["291801654_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns","262798280_DNA_Probes_Applications_of_the_Principles_of_Nucleic_Acid_Hybridization","246863810_Mann_S_Molecular_recognition_in_biomineralization_Nature_332_119-124","221590344_The_program-size_complexity_of_self-assembled_squares_extended_abstract","220132745_The_effect_of_malformed_tiles_on_tile_assemblies_within_the_kinetic_tile_assembly_model","24234274_An_Information-Bearing_Seed_for_Nucleating_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly","23983670_Geiger_B_Spatz_JP_Bershadsky_ADEnvironmental_sensing_through_focal_adhesions_Nat_Rev_Mol_Cell_Biol_10_21-33","21624287_Metabolic_Control_Analysis-a_Survey_of_its_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Development","14560069_Improved_Nearest-Neighbor_Parameters_for_Predicting_DNA_Duplex_Stability","13765910_A_Unified_View_of_Polymer_Dumbbell_and_Oligonucleotide_DNA_Nearest-Neighbor_Thermodynamics","12295372_Logical_computation_using_algorithmic_self-assembly_of_DNA_triple-crossover_molecules","9077170_DNA-templated_self-assembly_of_protein_arrays_and_highly_conductive_NWs","8143645_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Sierpinski_Triangles","8126365_Building_Programmable_Jigsaw_Puzzles_with_RNA","8034733_Joining_and_Scission_in_the_Self-Assembly_of_Nanotubes_from_DNA_Tiles","7237731_Rothemund_PWK_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns_Nature_440_297-302","344676726_Probabilistic_Logics_and_the_Synthesis_of_Reliable_Organisms_From_Unreliable_Components","316520333_Universal_computation_via_self-assembly_of_DNA_Some_theory_and_experiments","316520069_On_the_computational_power_of_DNA_annealing_and_ligation","291939338_Synthesis_of_crystals_with_a_programmable_kinetic_barrier_to_nucleation","275508766_Actin_and_Actin-Binding_Proteins_A_Critical_Evaluation_of_Mechanisms_and_Functions","272522285_Thermodynamics_and_kinetics_of_DNA_nanotube_polymerization_from_single-filament_measurements","262054245_Kinetics_of_DNA_Tile_Dimerization","260934229_Complexity_of_Self-Assembled_Shapes","255688157_Directed_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Nanotubes_Using_Programmable_Seeds","243772945_Theory_and_Experiments_in_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly","231531497_Designed_Two-Dimensional_DNA_Holliday_Junction_Arrays_Visualized_by_Atomic_Force_Microscopy","225306065_Direct_Atomic_Force_Microscopy_Observation_of_DNA_Tile_Crystal_Growth_at_the_Single-Molecule_Level","225104422_Error_suppression_mechanisms_for_DNA_tile_self-assembly_and_their_simulation","225094908_Complex_shapes_self-assembled_from_single-stranded_DNA_tiles","224371154_Precise_Simulation_Model_for_DNA_Tile_Self-Assembly","223974599_Robust_self-replication_of_combinatorial_information_via_crystal_growth_and_scission","222438045_A_General_Method_of_Numerically_Simulating_the_Stochastic_Time_Evolution_of_Coupled_Chemical_Reactions","220846230_Proofreading_Tile_Sets_Error_Correction_for_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly","220846026_Complexity_of_Compact_Proofreading_for_Self-assembled_Patterns","50343800_Construction_Analysis_Ligation_and_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Triple_Crossover_Complexes","23240925_Toward_Reliable_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Tiles_A_Fixed-Width_Cellular_Automaton_Pattern","21054552_Seeman_N_C_De_novo_design_of_sequences_for_nucleic_acid_structure_engineering_J_Biomol_Struct_Dyn_8_573-581","20483249_Icosahedral_RNA_virus_structure_Annu_Rev_Biochem","19634976_Actin_and_Actin-Binding_Proteins_A_Critical_Evaluation_of_Mechanisms_and_Functions","14738600_DNA_Double-Crossover_Molecules","13578425_Design_and_Self-Assembly_of_Two-Dimensional_DNA_Crystals","12356548_Structural_Insights_into_Microtubule_Function","11899089_Structural_Insights_into_Microtubule_Function","10581936_Ribosome_assembly_in_eukaryotes","8225226_Triggered_Amplification_by_Hybridization_Chain_Reaction","7750699_Signaling_to_Cytoskeletal_Dynamics_during_Chemotaxis","7630143_Self-Assembly_of_Hexagonal_DNA_Two-Dimensional_2D_Arrays","7419198_Two_Computational_Primitives_for_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly_Copying_and_Counting","6246026_Paradigms_for_computational_nucleic_acid_design","5648242_Programming_biomolecular_self-assembly_pathways","2911898_Error_Free_Self-Assembly_using_Error_Prone_Tiles","2878028_Compact_Error-Resilient_Computational_DNA_Tiling_Assemblies","6120706_Reducing_Facet_Nucleation_During_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly","5960751_Schulman_R_Winfree_E_Synthesis_of_crystals_with_a_programmable_kinetic_barrier_to_nucleation_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA_104_15236-15241"]}
