{"id":"281895976_Factorization_threshold_models_for_scale-free_networks_generation","abstract":"Background\nSeveral models for producing scale-free networks have been suggested; most of them are based on the preferential attachment approach. In this article, we suggest a new approach for generating scale-free networks with an alternative source of the power-law degree distribution. Methods\nThe model derives from matrix factorization methods and geographical threshold models that were recently proven to show good results in generating scale-free networks. We associate each node with a vector having latent features distributed over a unit sphere and with a weight variable sampled from a Pareto distribution. We join two nodes by an edge if they are spatially close and/or have large weights. Results and conclusionThe network produced by this approach is scale free and has a power-law degree distribution with an exponent of 2. In addition, we propose an extension of the model that allows us to generate directed networks with tunable power-law exponents.","authors":["Akmal Artikov","Aleksandr Dorodnykh","Yana Kashinskaya","Egor Samosvat"],"meta":["August 2016Computational Social Networks 3(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40649-016-0029-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["224951757_Clustering_of_random_scale-free_networks","12779869_Albert_R_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks_Science_286_509-512","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","224574578_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems_IEEE_Computer_Journal_428_30-37","222411422_The_Structure_and_Function_of_Complex_Networks","220698959_Link_Prediction_via_Matrix_Factorization","220345674_The_degree_sequence_of_a_scale-free_random_graph_process","51528896_Scale-free_networks_embedded_in_fractal_space"]}
