{"id":"274644887_AiiDA_Automated_Interactive_Infrastructure_and_Database_for_Computational_Science","abstract":"Computational science has seen in the last decades a spectacular rise in the\nscope, breadth, and depth of its efforts. Notwithstanding this prevalence and\nimpact, it is often still performed using the renaissance model of individual\nartisans gathered in a workshop, under the guidance of an established\npractitioner. Great benefits could follow instead from adopting concepts and\ntools coming from computer science to manage, preserve, and share these\ncomputational efforts. We illustrate here our paradigm sustaining such vision,\nbased around the four pillars of Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing,\nand discuss its implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform\n(http://www.aiida.net). The platform is tuned first to the demands of\ncomputational materials science: coupling remote management with automatic data\ngeneration; ensuring provenance, preservation, and searchability of\nheterogeneous data through a design based on directed acyclic graphs; encoding\ncomplex sequences of low-level codes into scientific workflows and turnkey\nsolutions to boost productivity and ensure reproducibility; and developing an\necosystem that encourages the sharing and dissemination of codes, data, and\nscientific workflows.","authors":["Giovanni Pizzi","Andrea Cepellotti","Riccardo Sabatini","Nicola Marzari"],"meta":["April 2015Computational Materials Science 111","DOI:10.1016/j.commatsci.2015.09.013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["271856863_Computing_stoichiometric_molecular_composition_from_crystal_structures","267728073_The_top_100_papers","262452236_Koopmans-compliant_functionals_and_their_performance_against_reference_molecular_data","236614387_The_Taverna_Workflow_Suite_Designing_and_Executing_Workflows_of_Web_Services_on_the_Desktop_Web_or_in_the_Cloud","235669169_The_high-throughput_highway_to_computational_materials_design","233870697_AFLOWLIBORG_A_distributed_materials_properties_repository_from_high-throughput_ab_initio_calculations","232762342_The_inverse_band-structure_problem_of_finding_an_atomic_configurationwith_given_electronic_properties","230973440_QUANTUM_ESPRESSO_a_modular_and_open-source_software_project_for_quantum_simulations_of_materials","230930686_ESTEST_A_framework_for_the_validation_and_verification_of_electronic_structure_codes","224223550_The_NumPy_Array_A_Structure_for_Efficient_Numerical_Computation","51787824_Crystallography_Open_Database_COD_An_open-access_collection_of_crystal_structures_and_platform_for_world-wide_collaboration","51722171_The_Quixote_project_Collaborative_and_Open_Quantum_Chemistry_data_management_in_the_Internet_age","44610760_Gaussian_Approximation_Potentials_The_Accuracy_of_Quantum_Mechanics_without_the_Electrons","9067352_Predicting_Crystal_Structures_with_Data_Mining_of_Quantum_Calculations","2245599_Maintaining_Transitive_Closure_of_Graphs_in_SQL","260586017_The_Computational_Materials_Repository","258167395_Materials_Design_and_Discovery_with_High-Throughput_Density_Functional_Theory_The_Open_Quantum_Materials_Database_OQMD","257357626_The_Pauling_File_Binaries_Edition","251619035_A_high-throughput_infrastructure_for_density_functional_theory_calculations","236935906_Pseudopotentials_for_high-throughput_DFT_calculations","236162546_Python_Materials_Genomics_pymatgen_A_robust_open-source_python_library_for_materials_analysis","222569659_USPEX-Evolutionary_crystal_structure_prediction","222521896_The_Open_Provenance_Model_core_specification_v11","220657712_Structural_database_for_reducing_cost_in_materials_design_and_complexity_of_multiscale_computations","220257830_Metadata_management_for_distributed_first_principles_calculations_in_VLab-A_collaborative_cyberinfrastructure_for_materials_computation","50398948_Ab_initio_Random_Structure_Searching","45912494_Setyawan_W_Curtarolo_S_High-throughput_electronic_band_structure_calculations_Challenges_and_tools_Comput_Mater_Sci_49_299","11279118_Combined_Electronic_Structure_and_Evolutionary_Search_Approach_to_Materials_Design","10743313_Chemical_markup_XML_and_the_world_wide_web_4_CML_schema","3422938_IPython_A_System_for_Interactive_Scientific_Computing","3422504_An_object-oriented_scripting_interface_to_a_legacy_electronicstructure_code","1950462_Thermal_Contraction_and_Disordering_of_the_Al110_Surface","1875698_A_real-space_grid_implementation_of_the_Projector_Augmented_Wave_method"]}
