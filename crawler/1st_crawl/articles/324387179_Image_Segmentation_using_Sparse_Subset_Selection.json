{"id":"324387179_Image_Segmentation_using_Sparse_Subset_Selection","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new image segmentation method based on the concept of sparse subset selection. Starting with an over-segmentation, we adopt local spectral histogram features to encode the visual information of the small segments into high-dimensional vectors, called superpixel features. Then, the superpixel features are fed into a novel convex model which efficiently leverages the features to group the superpixels into a proper number of coherent regions. Our model automatically determines the optimal number of coherent regions and superpixels assignment to shape final segments. To solve our model, we propose a numerical algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), whose iterations consist of two highly parallelizable sub-problems. We show each sub-problem enjoys closed-form solution which makes the ADMM iterations computationally very efficient. Extensive experiments on benchmark image segmentation datasets demonstrate that our proposed method in combination with an over-segmentation can provide high quality and competitive results compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Fariba Zohrizadeh","Mohsen Kheirandishfard","Farhad Kamangar"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["311610825_Scale-Aware_Alignment_of_Hierarchical_Image_Segmentation","300412747_Robust_Image_Segmentation_Using_Contour-Guided_Color_Palettes","285926394_Piecewise_Flat_Embedding_for_Image_Segmentation","280018811_SDPT3_-_a_MATLAB_software_package_for_semidefinite_programming_version_13","277335232_Image_Segmentation_Using_Hierarchical_Merge_Tree","264971227_Reverse_Image_Segmentation_A_High-Level_Solution_to_a_Low-Level_Task","261857477_Discrete-Continuous_Gradient_Orientation_Estimation_for_Faster_Image_Segmentation","261263532_Image_Segmentation_by_Cascaded_Region_Agglomeration","261116252_Segmentation_Using_Superpixels_A_Bipartite_Graph_Partitioning_Approach","241638970_A_Convex_Model_for_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_and_Dimensionality_Reduction_on_Physical_Space","220660505_TextonBoost_for_Image_Understanding_Multi-Class_Object_Recognition_and_Segmentation_by_Jointly_Modeling_Texture_Layout_and_Context","220416607_Distributed_Optimization_and_Statistical_Learning_via_the_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers","45821321_Contour_Detection_and_Hierarchical_Image_Segmentation","11435997_A_Stability_Based_Method_for_Discovering_Structure_in_Clustered_Data","8204631_How_Many_Clusters_An_Information-Theoretic_Perspective","318439989_Pushing_the_Boundaries_of_Boundary_Detection_using_Deep_Learning","313542424_An_automatic_system_for_cell_nuclei_pleomorphism_segmentation_in_histopathological_images_of_breast_cancer","313157156_Fast_alternating_direction_optimization_methods","312550454_FusionSeg_Learning_to_combine_motion_and_appearance_for_fully_automatic_segmention_of_generic_objects_in_videos","311610925_Active_Image_Segmentation_Propagation","311531874_Reliability-Based_Local_Features_Aggregation_for_Image_Segmentation","308277743_Laplacian_Pyramid_Reconstruction_and_Refinement_for_Semantic_Segmentation","305200362_Classifier_based_graph_construction_for_video_segmentation","303564120_Lifting_GIS_maps_into_strong_geometric_context_for_scene_understanding","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","296694149_Learning_Must-Link_Constraints_for_Video_Segmentation_Based_on_Spectral_Clustering","286594360_Multiscale_Combinatorial_Grouping","285807129_Mean_shift_A_robust_approach_toward_feature_space_analysis","278789807_Factorization-Based_Texture_Segmentation","276923091_Learning_Deconvolution_Network_for_Semantic_Segmentation","264276639_Dissimilarity-Based_Sparse_Subset_Selection","256459981_Projection_onto_the_probability_simplex_An_efficient_algorithm_with_a_simple_proof_and_an_application","245795097_Convex_Optimization_Cambridge_Univ","236916468_Learning_Full_Pairwise_Affinities_for_Spectral_Segmentation","233786506_See_All_by_Looking_at_A_Few_Sparse_Modeling_for_Finding_Representative_Objects","232503131_Efficient_Inference_in_Fully_Connected_CRFs_with_Gaussian_EdgePotentials","229058225_CVX_MATLAB_software_for_disciplined_convex_programming","227150482_Gaussian_elimination_is_not_optimal","222625249_A_dual_algorithm_for_the_solution_of_nonlinear_variational_problems_via_finite_element_approximation","221996717_Objective_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_Clustering_Methods","221364208_Spectral_Segmentation_with_Multiscale_Graph_Decomposition","221364022_Boundary_Preserving_Dense_Local_Regions","221259634_Improving_Spatial_Support_for_Objects_via_Multiple_Segmentations","220049031_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","215721562_Efficient_Graph-Based_Image_Segmentation","6773304_Image_and_Texture_Segmentation_Using_Local_Spectral_Histograms","4772044_Estimating_the_Number_of_Clusters_in_a_Data_Set_Via_the_Gap_Statistic","3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics","2259572_Using_SeDuMi_102_a_MATLAB_toolbox_for_optimization_over_symmetric_cones"]}
