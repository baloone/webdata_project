{"id":"281119805_Freeness_versus_maximal_global_Tjurina_number_for_plane_curves","abstract":"We give a characterization of nearly free plane curves in terms of their\nglobal Tjurina numbers, similar to the characterization of free curves as\ncurves with a maximal Tjurina number, due to A. A. du Plessis and C.T.C. Wall.\nIt is also shown that an irreducible plane curve having a 1-dimensional\nsymmetry is nearly free. A new simple characterization of nearly free curves in\nterms of their syzygies concludes this note.","authors":["Alexandru Dimca"],"meta":["August 2016Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society 163(1)","DOI:10.1017/S0305004116000803","Project: Free and nearly free projective hypersurfaces"],"references":["280061797_Free_and_nearly_free_surfaces_in_P3","278674221_Free_and_nearly_free_divisors_vsrational_cuspidal_plane_curves","274644782_Free_divisors_and_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves","259915235_Syzygies_and_logarithmic_vector_fields_along_plane_curves","232028372_Syzygies_of_Jacobian_ideals_and_defects_of_linear_systems","232025280_Application_of_the_theory_of_the_discriminant_to_highly_singular_plane_curves","230568203_Homology_of_Homogeneous_Divisors","225145247_Elementary_modifications_and_line_configurations_in_P2","29772186_Theory_of_logarithmic_differential_forms_and_logarithmic_vector_fields","321507344_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","307896009_Elementary_modifications_and_line_configurations_in_P","285458942_On_the_exponents_of_free_and_nearly_free_projective_plane_curves","281608018_Freeness_versus_maximal_degree_of_the_singular_subscheme_for_surfaces_in_P3","261065856_Hilbert_Series_and_Lefschetz_Properties_of_Dimension_One_Almost_Complete_Intersections","251701954_Lectures_on_the_Geometry_of_Syzygies","243065859_Koszul_Complexes_and_Hypersurface_Singularities","238950869_The_local_cohomology_of_the_jacobian_ring","233917732_Freeness_of_hyperplane_arrangements_and_related_topics","46958151_Arrangements_of_Hyperplanes","27587329_Curves_in_P2C_with_1-dimensional_symmetry","2574787_The_Geometry_of_Syzygies_-_A_second_course_in_Commutative_Algebra_and_Algebraic_Geometry"]}
