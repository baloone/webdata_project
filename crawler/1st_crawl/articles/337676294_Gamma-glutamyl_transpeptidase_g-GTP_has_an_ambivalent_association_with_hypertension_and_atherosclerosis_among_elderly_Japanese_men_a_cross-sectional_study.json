To clarify the association of endothelial repair with hypertension, a cross-sectional study was conducted.\n\nMethods: \nWe conducted a cross-sectional study of 562 elderly Japanese men aged 60-69. As gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) could act as a marker of oxidative stress that injures endothelial cell and higher levels of CD34-positive cell indicate a higher activity of endothelial repair, we therefore performed a CD34-positive level specific analysis of γ-GTP on atherosclerosis and hypertension.\n\nResults: \nIn the present study population, hypertension was independently and positively associated with atherosclerosis (multivariable odds ratio (OR) = 2.09 (1.30, 3.35)). Among participants with high CD34-positive cells, γ-GTP showed significant and positive association with atherosclerosis (OR of the log-transformed value of γ-GTP (OR) = 2.26 (1.32, 3.86)) but not with hypertension (OR = 0.77 (0.51, 1.17)). Among participants with low CD34-positive cells, even γ-GTP showed no significant association with atherosclerosis (OR = 0.92 (0.51, 1.68)), but was significantly and positively associated with hypertension (OR = 1.99 (1.27, 3.12)).\n\nConclusions: \nγ-GTP revealed to have ambivalent association with hypertension and atherosclerosis. Active endothelial repair that is associated with atherosclerosis might have beneficial association with hypertension.","authors":["Yuji Shimizu","Shin-Ya Kawashiri","Kairi Kiyoura","Kenichi Nobusue"],"meta":["December 2019Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine 24(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12199-019-0828-2"],"references":["330719105_Association_between_height_and_circulating_CD34-positive_cells_taken_into_account_for_the_influence_of_enhanced_production_among_elderly_Japanese_men_A_cross-sectional_study","324928632_Hepatocyte_growth_factor_and_carotid_intima-media_thickness_in_relation_to_circulating_CD34-positive_cell_levels","321196194_Triglycerides_and_blood_pressure_in_relation_to_circulating_CD34-positive_cell_levels_among_community-dwelling_elderly_Japanese_men_A_cross-sectional_study","319880628_Oxidative_Stress_in_Atherosclerosis","317821124_Association_between_high-density_lipoprotein-cholesterol_and_hypertension_in_relation_to_circulating_CD34-positive_cell_levels","336515417_Evidence_for_Circulating_Bone_Marrow-Derived_Endothelial_Cells","336505572_Evidence_for_Circulating_Bone_Marrow-Derived_Endothelial_Cells","332063356_Cardio-ankle_vascular_index_and_circulating_CD34-positive_cell_levels_as_indicators_of_endothelial_repair_activity_in_older_Japanese_men","331026495_Association_between_chronic_kidney_disease_and_carotid_intima-media_thickness_in_relation_to_circulating_CD34-positive_cell_count_among_community-dwelling_elderly_Japanese_men","322332653_Essential_Hypertension_and_Functional_Microvascular_Ageing"]}
