{"id":"327783797_An_Improved_Method_for_Restoring_the_Shape_of_3D_Point_Cloud_Surfaces","abstract":"Building 3D objects or reconstructing their surfaces from 3D point cloud data are researched activities in the field of geometric modeling and computer graphics. In the recent years, they are also studied and used in some fields such as: graph models and simulation; image processing or restoration of digital heritages. This article presents an improved method for restoring the shape of 3D point cloud surfaces. The method is a combination of creating a Bezier surface patch and computing tangent plane of 3D points to fill holes on a surface of 3D point clouds. This method is described as follows: at first, a boundary for each hole on the surface is identified. The holes are then filled by computing Bezier curves of surface patches to find missing points. After that, the holes are refined based on two steps (rough and elaborate) to adjust the inserted points and preserve the local curvature of the holes. The contribution of the proposed method has been shown in processing time and the novelty of combined computation in this method has preserved the initial shape of the surface","authors":["Sinh Van Nguyen","Ha Manh Tran","Tráº§n Khai Minh"],"meta":["July 2018International Journal of Synthetic Emotions 9(2):37-53","DOI:10.4018/IJSE.2018070103"],"references":["312565329_A_comparison_of_hole-filling_methods_in_3D","305490183_Procedural_Editing_of_3D_Building_Point_Clouds","288182201_Procedural_Editing_of_3D_Building_Point_Clouds","276440851_Filling_holes_in_digitized_point_cloud_using_a_morphing-based_approach_to_preserve_volume_characteristics","262401134_Boundary_extraction_and_simplification_of_a_surface_defined_by_a_sparse_3D_volume","262323821_A_new_model_for_performance_evaluation_of_denoising_algorithms_based_on_image_quality_assessment","249960722_Efficient_computation_of_Bezier_curves_from_their_Bernstein-Fourier_representation","221561660_A_Hole-filling_Algorithm_Using_Non-uniform_Rational_B-splines","221403700_Filling_Holes_in_Point_Clouds","47364935_Interpretation_geologique_de_donnees_sismiques_par_une_methode_supervisee_basee_sur_la_vision_cognitive","323506260_Filling_Hole_on_the_Surface_of_3D_Point_Clouds_Based_on_Reverse_Computation_of_Bezier_Curves","321216947_Filling_Missing_Parts_of_a_3D_Mesh_by_Fusion_of_Incomplete_3D_Data","315998482_3D_geological_modelling_based_on_2D_geological_map","315367339_A_fast_and_automatic_hole-filling_method_based_on_feature_line_recovery","314482063_3D_building_roof_reconstruction_from_airborne_LiDAR_point_clouds_a_framework_based_on_a_spatial_database","311622716_Filling_holes_on_the_surface_of_3D_point_clouds_based_on_tangent_plane_of_hole_boundary_points","309594412_Automatic_tree_data_removal_method_for_topography_measurement_result_using_terrestrial_laser_scanner","304555995_A_Complete_Method_for_Reconstructing_an_Elevation_Surface_of_3D_Point_Clouds","300410241_Hole_Boundary_Detection_of_a_Surface_of_3D_Point_Clouds","296486161_A_Computationally_Efficient_Denoising_and_Hole-Filling_Method_for_Depth_Image_Enhancement","276240731_A_Sampling_Method_Based_on_Curvature_Analysis_of_Cubic_Bezier_Curve","261693066_An_Automatic_Hole-Filling_Algorithm_for_Polygon_Meshes","261421143_Filling_large_holes_in_LiDAR_data_by_inpainting_depth_gradients","257406832_An_efficient_and_collision-free_hole-filling_algorithm_for_orthodontics","228821737_3D_Shape_Reconstruction_from_2D_Images","228417765_Filling_Holes_with_B-spline_Surfaces","220721235_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Unorganized_Points","220583416_Adaptive_patch-based_mesh_fitting_for_reverse_engineering","220221430_Geometric_interpolation_by_planar_cubic_polynomial_curves","220220903_Filling_polygonal_holes_with_bicubic_patches"]}
