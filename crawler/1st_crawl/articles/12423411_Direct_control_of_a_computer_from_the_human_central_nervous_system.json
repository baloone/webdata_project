{"id":"12423411_Direct_control_of_a_computer_from_the_human_central_nervous_system","abstract":"We describe an invasive alternative to externally applied brain-computer interface (BCI) devices. This system requires implantation of a special electrode into the outer layers of the human neocortex. The recorded signals are transmitted to a nearby receiver and processed to drive a cursor on a computer monitor in front of the patient. Our present patient has learned to control the cursor for the production of synthetic speech and typing.","authors":["P. R. Kennedy","R.A.E. Bakay","Melody Moore Jackson","K.
