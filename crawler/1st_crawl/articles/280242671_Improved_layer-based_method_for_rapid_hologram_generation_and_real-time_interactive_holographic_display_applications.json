{"id":"280242671_Improved_layer-based_method_for_rapid_hologram_generation_and_real-time_interactive_holographic_display_applications","abstract":"Layer-based method has been proposed as an efficient approach to calculate holograms for holographic image display. This paper further improves its calculation speed and depth cues quality by introducing three different techniques, an improved coding scheme, a multilayer depth- fused 3D method and a fraction method. As a result the total computation time is reduced more than 4 times, and holographic images with accommodation cue are calculated in real time to interactions with the displayed image in a proof-of-concept setting of head-mounted holographic displays.","authors":["J.-S.
