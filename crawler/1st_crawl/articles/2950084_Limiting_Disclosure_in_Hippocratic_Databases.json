{"id":"2950084_Limiting_Disclosure_in_Hippocratic_Databases","abstract":"This chapter presents a practical and efficient approach for incorporating privacy policy enforcement into an existing application and database environment. It explores several semantic tradeoffs introduced by enforcing these privacy policy rules at cell-level granularity. A comprehensive set of performance experiments are used to show that the cost of privacy enforcement is small, and scalable to large databases. There are several important extensions to this approach that are areas of ongoing and future work. One such extension would allow one to assign versions to privacy policies. In this case, personal data would be permanently associated with the policy in place at the time of collection. The database would then be responsible for enforcing these multiple policies as queries are issued. Another such extension would provide a granular privacy enforcement for data modification commands.","authors":["Kristen Lefevre","Rakesh Agrawal","Vuk Ercegovac","Raghu Ramakrishnan"],"meta":["October 2004","DOI:10.1016/B978-012088469-8.50013-9"],"references":["267953866_Enterprise_Privacy_Authorization_Language_EPAL","220071090_The_SeaView_Security_Model","3187249_The_SeaView_security_model","2615894_Tuple-Level_Vs_Element-Level_Classification","2550359_Enter_Once_Share_Everywhere_User_Profile_Management_in_Converged_Networks","314918384_An_authorization_mechanism_for_a_relational_data_base_system","313193607_Role_based_access_control_models","261324639_Elements_of_Statistical_Disclosure_Control_Lecture_Notes_in_Statistics","255664143_The_Wisconsin_Benchmark_Past_Present_and_Future","252064494_The_Platform_for_Privacy_Preferences_10_P3P10_Specification","247079070_Oracle_Privacy_Security_Auditing","242699772_The_platform_for_privacy_preferences_1","238685964_Security-control_methods_for_statistical_databases","238672205_Secure_Computer_Systems_Unified_Exposition_and_Multics_Interpretation","234780920_Access_control_in_a_relational_data_base_management_system_by_query_modification","220688824_A_Complete_Guide_to_DB2_Universal_Database","220688492_Database_Security","220225444_An_Authorization_Mechanism_for_a_Relational_Database_System","27377008_Database_Management_Systems","14259078_A_security_mediator_for_health_care_information","4053436_The_quiq_engine_A_hybrid_ir-db_system","3508427_A_novel_decomposition_of_multilevel_relations_into_single-levelrelations","3504771_Polyinstantiation_Integrity_In_Multilevel_Relations","2954526_Role_based_access_control_models_ieee_computer","2538919_Chapter_14_Hippocratic_Databases"]}
