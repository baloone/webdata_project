{"id":"344236189_FUZZY_COMBINATORIAL_DUAL_GRAPH","abstract":"Fuzzy graph is now a very important research area due to its wide application.\nFuzzy planar graph is an important subclass of fuzzy graph theory. In this paper, we define\nthe fuzzy combinatorial dual graph which is very close association with the fuzzy dual graph.\nThe fuzzy combinatorial dual graph is defined and derived some of the results.","authors":["Shriram Kalathian","Sujatha Ramalingam","S.
