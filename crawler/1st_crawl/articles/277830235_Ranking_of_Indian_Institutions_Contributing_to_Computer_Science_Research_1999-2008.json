{"id":"277830235_Ranking_of_Indian_Institutions_Contributing_to_Computer_Science_Research_1999-2008","abstract":"The present study undertakes the ranking of the most productive Indian institutions, viz., institutes of national importance, universities/ deemed universities, industrial enterprises, research institutes, Indian Institute(s) of Information Technology (IIIT(s)), select top engineering colleges, and regional engineering colleges (RECs)/National Institutes of Technology (NITs) in computer science research for their research output published during 1999-2008. The publications output of these productive institutions is judged on the basis of various quantitative indicators, such as the total number of raw papers and international collaborative papers and qualitative indicators, such as the average number of citations per paper and h-index value, and also in terms of a new composite indicator, which combines quantitative and qualitative aspects.http://dx.doi.org/10.14429/djlit.31.6.1320","authors":["Brij Mohan Gupta","Adarsh Bala","Nandini Sharma"],"meta":["November 2011DESIDOC Journal of Library & Information Technology 31(6)","DOI:10.14429/djlit.31.6.1320"],"references":["2954776_Computer_science_research_in_India","226582785_The_100_most_prolific_economists_using_the","225624332_Going_much_beyond_the_Durfee_square_Enhancing_the_hT_index"]}
