{"id":"332028435_Generation_of_Heterogeneous_Virtual_Crowds_based_on_Patterns_of_Grouping_of_Human_Behavior","abstract":"Computer science with other areas of knowledge is involved in the study of the individual's behavior of the crowd, trying to predict and anticipate situations that may arise. In crowd simulations, we can see differents experimentations that provide the different behavior on specific conditions or eventualities not controlled. In this paper, we present one technique based on Voronoi diagrams to defined the local concentration of people (LCP) that permitted create the heterogeneous crowd. LCP identified the principal place of environment where to exist the possibility of a crowd. The Voronoi diagrams help to agents to find the particular location to access a resource to complete the main goal. The first results showed the way of how the agents can crowd like the circles, delta, and oval groupping.","authors":["Fernando Rebollar Castelan","Marco Antonio Ramos Corchado","Vianney Muñoz-Jiménez","Félix Ramos"],"meta":["November 2016","Project: Sistemas Multi-Agentes"],"references":["316123012_Large_crowds_of_autonomous_animated_characters_using_fragment_shaders_and_level_of_detail","257213887_Motion_Planning_in_Dynamic_Environments_Using_Velocity_Obstacles","252028225_A_simulation_model_of_pedestrian_flow_based_on_geographical_cellular_automata","239791848_Comportamientos_en_simulacion_de_multitudes_revision_del_estado_del_arte","339204338_Procesos_de_decision_de_Markov_y_microescenarios_para_navegacion_y_evasion_de_colisiones_para_multitudes","312944477_Challenges_in_Crowd_Simulation","312464893_Controlling_individual_agents_in_high-density_crowd_simulation","252018468_Simulation_of_crowd_behaviors_based_on_event_reaction","239744426_A_Behavioral_Model_for_Real_Time_Simulation_of_Virtual_Human_Crowds","235709967_Flocks_Herds_and_Schools_A_Distributed_Behavioral_Model","228807823_A_Behavior_Authoring_Framework_for_Multi-Actor_Simulations","225369513_Reciprocal_n-Body_Collision_Avoidance","234806146_Collision_detection_and_proximity_queries","226439861_A_Sweepline_Algorithm_for_Voronoi_Diagrams","224890260_Real-time_navigating_crowds_Scalable_simulation_and_rendering"]}
