{"id":"314229874_A_New_6-DOF_Quadrotor_Manipulation_System_Design_Kinematics_Dynamics_and_Control","abstract":"The research on aerial manipulation has been increased rapidly in recent years. In the previous work, a manipulator or a gripper is attached to the bottom of a quadrotor to facilitate the interaction with the environment. However, the previously introduced systems suffer from either limited end-effector Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) or small payload capacity. In this article, a quadrotor with a 2-DOF manipulator that has a unique topology to enable the end-effector to track a desired 6-DOF trajectory with minimum possible actuators, is investigated. The proposed system is designed and modeled. However, such a system produces complexity to its inverse kinematics and control. A novel solution to the inverse kinematics problem is presented which requires a solution of complicated algebraic/differential equations. Its accuracy is verified via numerical results. In order to solve the control problem, the system nonholonomic constraints are utilized with a model free and low computation cost robust control technique. Moreover, the system stability proof under the proposed controller is carried out. The feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed system are verified via a quite realistic simulation setup.","authors":["Mohamed Fanni","Ahmed Khalifa"],"meta":["April 2017IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TMECH.2017.2681179","Project: Aerial Manipulation"],"references":["311662203_Image-Based_Visual_Servoing_of_a_Quadrotor_Using_Virtual_Camera_Approach","271218964_Dynamics_and_Control_of_Quadrotor_UAVs_Transporting_a_Rigid_Body_Connected_via_Flexible_Cables","269326693_Adaptive_Intelligent_Controller_Design_for_a_New_Quadrotor_Manipulation_System","345255552_Disturbance_Observer-Based_Control_Methods_and_Applications","321515652_Vehicle-Manipulator_Systems","283813362_A_nonlinear_stability_analysis_for_the_robust_position_control_problem_of_robot_manipulators_via_disturbance_observer","283592644_A_simplified_model_based_disturbance_rejection_control_for_highly_accurate_positioning_of_an_underwater_robot","276923497_Nonlinear_Control_of_Quadrotor_for_Point_Tracking_Actual_Implementation_and_Experimental_Tests","271996235_Disturbance_observer_based_path_tracking_of_robot_manipulator_considering_torque_saturation","269944065_Aerial_Robotic_Construction_Towards_a_New_Field_of_Architectural_Research"]}
