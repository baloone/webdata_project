{"id":"319857115_Representing_Argumentation_Frameworks_in_Answer_Set_Programming","abstract":"This paper studies representation of argumentation frameworks (AFs) in answer set programming (ASP).Four different transformations from AFs to logic programs are provided under the complete semantics, stable semantics, grounded semantics and preferred semantics.The proposed transformations encode labelling-based argumentation semantics in a simple manner, and different semantics of AFs are uniformly characterized by stable models of transformed programs.We apply transformed programs to solving AF problems such as query-Answering, enforcement of arguments, agreement or equivalence of different AFs.Logic programming encodings of AFs are also used for representing assumption-based argumentation (ABA) in ASP.The results of this paper exploit new connections between argumentation theory and logic programming, and enable one to perform various argumentation tasks using existing answer set solvers.","authors":["Chiaki Sakama","Tjitze Rienstra"],"meta":["September 2017Fundamenta Informaticae 155(3):261-292","DOI:10.3233/FI-2017-1585"],"references":["326206693_On_the_Equivalence_between_Assumption-Based_Argumentation_and_Logic_Programming_Extended_Abstract","323704721_Expanding_Argumentation_Frameworks_Enforcing_and_Monotonicity_Results","289747808_Dishonest_arguments_in_debate_games","275831223_Extension_Enforcement_in_Abstract_Argumentation_as_an_Optimization_Problem","228727233_A_formal_analysis_of_the_role_of_argumentation_in_negotiation_dialogues","226067612_Assumption-Based_Argumentation","220547514_Characterizing_strong_equivalence_for_argumentation_frameworks","220546551_An_Abstract_Argumentation-Theoretic_Approach_to_Default_Reasoning","220543090_On_the_Intertranslatability_of_Argumentation_Semantics","220421804_Answer_Set_Programming_at_a_Glance","220254331_An_introduction_to_argumentation_semantics","51932977_Making_Use_of_Advances_in_Answer-Set_Programming_for_AbstractArgumentation_Systems","28319407_Inferring_Preferred_Extensions_by_Pstable_Semantics","2742259_The_Well-Founded_Semantics_for_General_Logic_Programs","2408055_The_Stable_Model_Semantics_For_Logic_Programming","321002184_Complexity_Results_and_Algorithms_for_Extension_Enforcement_in_Abstract_Argumentation","288628428_Complete_Assumption_Labellings","285432624_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_and_logic_programming","285312481_On_the_difference_between_assumption-based_argumentation_and_abstract_argumentation","280498429_Improved_Answer-Set_Programming_Encodings_for_Abstract_Argumentation","268978965_Classical_Negation_in_Logic_Programs_and_Deductive_Databases","255303000_Complete_Extensions_in_Argumentation_Coincide_with_3Valued_Stable_Models_in_Logic_Programming","250398124_Combining_sceptical_epistemic_reasoning_with_credulous_practical_reasoning_corrected_version1","228653271_Answer-set_programming_encodings_for_argumentation_frameworks","226808352_Complexity_of_Abstract_Argumentation","226525581_Proof_Theories_and_Algorithms_for_Abstract_Argumentation_Frameworks","223206895_Computing_ideal_sceptical_argumentation","222120146_A_three-valued_semantics_for_deductive_databases_and_logic_programs","221306722_Verifying_the_Equivalence_of_Logic_Programs_in_the_Disjunctive_Case","220642762_Complexity_and_Undecidability_Results_for_Logic_Programming","220297914_A_Logical_Account_of_Formal_Argumentation","2814066_Propositional_Semantics_for_Disjunctive_Logic_Programs","2653816_Well-Founded_Semantics_Coincides_with_Three-Valued_Stable_Semantics"]}
