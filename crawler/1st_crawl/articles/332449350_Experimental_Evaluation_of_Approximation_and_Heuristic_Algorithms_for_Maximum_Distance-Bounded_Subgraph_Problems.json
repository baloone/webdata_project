{"id":"332449350_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Approximation_and_Heuristic_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Distance-Bounded_Subgraph_Problems","abstract":"In this paper, we consider two distance-based relaxed variants of the maximum clique problem (Max Clique), named Maxd-Clique and Maxd-Club for positive integers d. Max 1-Clique and Max 1-Club cannot be efficiently approximated within a factor of n1-ε for any real ε>0 unless P=NP, since they are identical to Max Clique (Håstad in Acta Math 182(1):105–142, 1999; Zuckerman in Theory Comput 3:103–128, 2007). In addition, it is NP-hard to approximate Maxd-Clique and Maxd-Club to within a factor of n1/2-ε for any fixed integer d≥2 and any real ε>0 (Asahiro et al. in Approximating maximum diameter-bounded subgraphs. In: Proc of LATIN 2010, Springer, pp 615–626, 2010; Asahiro et al. in Optimal approximation algorithms for maximum distance-bounded subgraph problems. In: Proc of COCOA, Springer, pp 586–600, 2015). As for approximability of Maxd-Clique and Maxd-Club, a polynomial-time algorithm, called ReFindStard, that achieves an optimal approximation ratio of O(n1/2) for Maxd-Clique and Maxd-Club was designed for any integer d≥2 in Asahiro et al. (2015, Algorithmica 80(6):1834–1856, 2018). Moreover, a simpler algorithm, called ByFindStard, was proposed and it was shown in Asahiro et al. (2010, 2018) that although the approximation ratio of ByFindStard is much worse for any oddd≥3, its time complexity is better than ReFindStard. In this paper, we implement those approximation algorithms and evaluate their quality empirically for random graphs. The experimental results show that (1) ReFindStard can find larger d-clubs (d-cliques) than ByFindStard for odd d, (2) the size of d-clubs (d-cliques) output by ByFindStard is the same as ones by ReFindStard for even d, and (3) ByFindStard can find the same size of d-clubs (d-cliques) much faster than ReFindStard. Furthermore, we propose and implement two new heuristics, Hclubd for Maxd-Club and Hcliqued for Maxd-Clique. Then, we present the experimental evaluation of the solution size of ReFindStard, Hclubd, Hcliqued and previously known heuristic algorithms for random graphs and Erdős collaboration graphs.","authors":["Yuichi Asahiro","Tomohiro Kubo","Eiji Miyano"],"meta":["April 2019The Review of Socionetwork Strategies 13(1)","DOI:10.1007/s12626-019-00036-2"],"references":["268988477_New_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem_on_Large_Sparse_Graphs_with_Applications_to_Overlapping_Community_Detection","265617090_The_Nature_of_Computation","257658028_On_inclusionwise_maximal_and_maximum_cardinality_-clubs_in_graphs","257588965_Speeding_up_branch_and_bound_algorithms_for_solving_the_maximum_clique_problem","244957010_A_graph-theoretic_definition_of_a_sociometric_clique","233251812_A_graph-theoretic_generalization_of_the_clique_concept","222151359_Network_Structure_And_Minimum_DegreeSoc_Netw_5269-287","220980362_Massive_Quasi-Clique_Detection","220909316_An_Efficient_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Clique","2568360_Massive_Quasi-Clique_Detection","318604892_Optimal_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Distance-Bounded_Subgraph_Problems","312268718_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Distance-Bounded_Subgraph_Problems","301233247_Network_structure_and_minimum_degree","300132945_Optimal_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Distance-Bounded_Subgraph_Problems","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","259983448_Powers_of_Tensors_and_Fast_Matrix_Multiplication","257585885_Algorithms_for_the_maximum_k-club_problem_in_graphs","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","243135260_Heuristics_for_finding_k-clubs_in_an_undirected_graph","235737428_Random_Graph","228057712_On_random_graphs_I","227134964_Combining_Swaps_and_Node_Weights_in_an_Adaptive_Greedy_Approach_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","226335854_Cliques_clubs_and_clans","225116484_Connectivity_and_Generalized_Cliques_in_Sciometric_Group_Structure","222819543_An_effective_local_search_for_the_maximum_clique_problem","222444611_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","221013447_A_Simple_and_Faster_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Clique","220980315_Approximating_Maximum_Diameter-Bounded_Subgraphs","220574717_On_the_All-Pairs-Shortest-Path_Problem_in_Unweighted_Undirected_Graphs","220574521_All_Pairs_Shortest_Paths_for_Graphs_with_Small_Integer_Length_Edges","220469699_Heuristics_for_finding","220248337_All_Pairs_Shortest_Distances_for_Graphs_with_Small_Integer_Length_Edges","220188440_On_approximating_the_maximum_diameter_ratio_of_graphs","220138821_Linear_Degree_Extractors_and_the_Inapproximability_of_Max_Clique_and_Chromatic_Number","220081003_A_New_Algorithm_For_The_Maximum-Weight_Clique_Problem","216877588_A_new_algorithm_for_the_maximum_weight_clique_problem","24061162_Connectivity_and_generalized_cliques_in_sociometric_group_structure","5696089_A_Method_of_Matrix_Analysis_of_Group_Structure"]}
