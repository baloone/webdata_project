{"id":"267039524_Decision_making_based_on_optical_excitation_transfer_via_near-field_interactions_between_quantum_dots","abstract":"Optical near-field interactions between nanostructured matters, such as quantum dots, result in unidirectional optical excitation transfer when energy dissipation is induced. This results in versatile spatiotemporal dynamics of the optical excitation, which can be controlled by engineering the dissipation processes and exploited to realize intelligent capabilities such as solution searching and decision making. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the ability to solve a decision making problem on the basis of optical excitation transfer via near-field interactions by using colloidal quantum dots of different sizes, formed on a geometry-controlled substrate. We characterize the energy transfer behavior due to multiple control light patterns and experimentally demonstrate the ability to solve the multi-armed bandit problem. Our work makes a decisive step towards the practical design of nanophotonic systems capable of efficient decision making, one of the most important intellectual attributes of the human brain.","authors":["Makoto Naruse","Wataru Nomura","Masashi Aono","Motoichi Ohtsu"],"meta":["October 2014Journal of Applied Physics 116(15):154303","DOI:10.1063/1.4898570"],"references":["270946349_An_optical_fiber_network_oracle_for_NP-complete_problems","270443256_Amoeba-inspired_algorithm_for_cognitive_medium_access","257951010_Energy_dissipation_in_energy_transfer_mediated_by_optical_near-field_interactions_and_their_interfaces_with_optical_far-fields","255715069_ERRATUM_Decision_Maker_based_on_Nanoscale_Photo-excitation_Transfer","236234119_Spatiotemporal_dynamics_in_optical_energy_transfer_on_the_nanoscale_and_its_application_to_constraint_satisfaction_problems","236191507_Information_physics_fundamentals_of_nanophotonics","235658499_Molecular_neuroimaging_of_emotional_decision-making","236234970_Tug-of-war_model_for_the_two-bandit_problem_Nonlocally-correlated_parallel_exploration_via_resource_conservation","236137195_Amoeba-Inspired_Nanoarchitectonic_Computing_Solving_Intractable_Computational_Problems_Using_Nanoscale_Photoexcitation_Transfer_Dynamics","235771771_Multipolar_interband_absorption_in_a_semiconductor_quantum_dot_I_Electric_quadrupole_enhancement"]}
