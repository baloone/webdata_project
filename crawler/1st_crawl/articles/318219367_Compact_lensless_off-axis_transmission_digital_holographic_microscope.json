{"id":"318219367_Compact_lensless_off-axis_transmission_digital_holographic_microscope","abstract":"Current compact lensless holographic microscopes are based on either multiple angle in-line holograms, multiple wavelength illumination or a combination thereof. Complex computational algorithms are necessary to retrieve the phase image which slows down the visualization of the image. Here we propose a simple compact lensless transmission holographic microscope with an off-axis configuration which simplifies considerably the computational processing to visualize the phase images and opens the possibility of real time phase imaging using off the shelf smart phone processors and less than $3 worth of optics and detectors, suitable for broad educational dissemination. This is achieved using a side illumination and analog hologram gratings to shape the reference and signal illumination beams from one light source. We demonstrate experimentally imaging of cells with a field of view (FOV) of ~12mm2, and a resolution of ~3.9Î¼m.","authors":["Manon Rostykus","Christophe Moser"],"meta":["July 2017Optics Express 25(14):16652","DOI:10.1364/OE.25.016652"],"references":["315663386_Optically_driven_full-angle_sample_rotation_for_tomographic_imaging_in_digital_holographic_microscopy","313814150_Compact_lensless_phase_imager","274407198_Synthetic_aperture-based_on-chip_microscopy","233964220_Quantitative_phase-contrast_imaging_with_compact_digital_holographic_microscope_employing_Lloyd's_mirror","225097791_Quantitative_phase_microscopy_of_biological_samples_using_a_portable_interferometer","224240195_Imaging_Embryonic_Stem_Cell_Dynamics_Using_Quantitative_3-D_Digital_Holographic_Microscopy","26781315_Physical_phase_compensation_in_digital_holographic_microscopy","10641136_Digital_holographic_microscope_with_automatic_focus_tracking_by_detection_sample_displacement_in_real_time","7332688_Cell_refractive_index_tomography_by_digital_holographic_microscopy","314175441_Compact_and_field-portable_3D_printed_shearing_digital_holographic_microscope_for_automated_cell_identification","311237705_Optimized_setup_for_integral_refractive_index_direct_determination_applying_digital_holographic_microscopy_by_reflection_and_transmission","301795114_Compact_lensless_digital_holographic_microscopy_using_a_curved_mirror_for_an_enlarged_working_distance","280242717_Robust_compact_implementation_of_an_off-axis_digital_holographic_microscope","24173054_Automated_three-dimensional_tracking_of_living_cells_by_digital_holographic_microscopy"]}
