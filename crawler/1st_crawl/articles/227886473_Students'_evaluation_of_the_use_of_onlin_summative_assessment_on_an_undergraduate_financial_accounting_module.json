{"id":"227886473_Students'_evaluation_of_the_use_of_onlin_summative_assessment_on_an_undergraduate_financial_accounting_module","abstract":"According to the Quality Assurance Agency, ‘Assessment describes any processes that appraise an individual's knowledge, understanding, abilities or skills’, and is inextricably linked to a course or programme's intended learning outcomes. It also has a fundamental effect on students' learning where it serves a variety of purposes including evaluation, feedback and motivation. Assessment also provides a performance indicator for both students and staff. E-assessment offers opportunities for creating innovative assessment practices that help engage students and increase their motivation for learning. The paper reports the findings of a qualitative study undertaken in the academic years 2006–07 and 2007–08 where a series of online summative assessments were introduced into a 1st-year financial accounting course. Feedback from students obtained from an evaluative survey and focus group interviews indicates that assessment played a significant role in the teaching/learning process. That is, students perceived a beneficial impact on learning, motivation and engagement.","authors":["Pru Marriott"],"meta":["March 2009British Journal of Educational Technology 40(2):237 - 254","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00924.x"],"references":["252716670_Developing_a_variety_of_assessment_methods","239280482_KEYNOTE_PAPER_Principles_of_good_assessment_and_feedback_Theory_and_practice","238335480_Using_Experiential_Learning_Theory_and_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_in_Teaching_Business_Communication","235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","228621906_Formative_Assessment_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_A_Model_and_Seven_Principles_of_Good_Feedback_Practice","228351240_Increasing_success_in_first_year_courses_Assessment_re-design_self-regulation_and_learning_technologies","228348602_Measurement_and_analysis_of_student_engagement_in_university_classes_where_varying_levels_of_PBL_methods_of_instruction_are_in_use","24067484_Using_internet-based_on-line_assessment_A_case_study","6303234_Providing_Formative_Feedback_From_a_Summative_Computer-aided_Assessment","254297776_Student_Behaviour_and_Performance_in_Using_a_Web-Based_Assessment_System","251777530_Rethinking_Formative_Assessment_in_HE_a_theoretical_model_and_seven_principles_of_good_feedback_practice","249000395_The_religiosity-psychoticism_relationship_and_the_two_factors_of_social_desirability_A_response_to_Michael_W_Eysenck_1999","248426438_What_we''re_learning_about_student_engagement_from_NSSE","243783099_Assessing_Student_Learning_in_Higher_Education","243774862_A_Blueprint_for_Computer-Assisted_Assessment","242113498_Diversity_and_Innovation_in_Assessment_Practices_in_Higher_Education_Institutions_and_by_Employers_and_Training_Providers","238725517_Pedagogic_Challenges_Facing_Business_and_Management_Educators_Assessing_the_evidence","238401289_What_We're_Learning_About_Student_Engagement_From_NSSE_Benchmarks_for_Effective_Educational_Practices","235292344_Never_Mind_the_Teaching_-_Feel_the_Learning","233067274_Assessment_and_Classroom_Learning","228596180_How_to_assess_for_improvement_of_learning","29469094_Formative_Assessment_and_the_Design_of_Instructional_Systems"]}
