{"id":"330744406_Radiation_pattern_and_scattering_parameter_for_multilayer_cylindrical_loop_antenna_using_the_iterative_method_WCIP","abstract":"In this paper, we will present an integral method based on wave formulation to resolve the electromagnetic radiation problem of circular loop antenna in the presence of multilayer cylindrical body of revolution. The characteristics of this antenna structure is determined, especially the Scattering parameter and the radiation pattern evaluated in different plans (theta and phi plans). In order to obtain an ideal model as close as possible to the real antenna, a sensitivity study that depends on many parameters (The number of rings, the number of excitation sources, and the location of the sources) has been presented.","authors":["Ines Jarboua","Noemen Ammar","Taoufik Aguili","Henri Baudrand"],"meta":["March 2019AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications 101","DOI:10.1016/j.aeue.2019.01.024","Project: Regular paper Radiation pattern and scattering parameter for multilayer cylindrical loop antenna using the iterative method WCIP"],"references":["308278777_Formulation_and_Validation_of_the_WCIP_Applied_to_the_Analysis_of_Multilayer_Planar_Circuits_Theory_and_Applications","282619411_Wave_Concept_Iterative_Process_Method_for_Electromagnetic_or_Photonic_Jets_Numerical_and_Experimental_Results","260708132_Analysis_of_arbitrary_multiple-loop_antennas_around_a_conducting_cone_with_rotational_symmetry","260525284_Analysis_of_Multilayer_Amplifier_Structure_by_an_Efficient_Iterative_Technique","224157212_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Planar_Circuits_Design","3356236_Wave_concept_iterative_procedure_applied_to_cylinders","260722777_Characteristics_of_a_Circular_Loop_Antenna_in_the_Presence_of_a_Coaxial_Conducting_BOR_Attached_to_a_Planar_Reflector","260515484_Omnidirectional_Circularly_Polarized_Dielectric_Resonator_Antenna_With_Top-Loaded_Alford_Loop_for_Pattern_Diversity_Design","260515448_Radiation_from_a_Circular_Loop_Antenna_Placed_Coaxially_Relative_to_a_Conducting_Body_of_Revolution","245323265_An_Iterative_Process_Based_on_the_Concept_of_Waves_for_Electromagnetic_Scattering_Problems"]}
