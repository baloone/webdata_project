{"id":"329668058_Practitioner's_Note","abstract":"Deliberative forums, such as citizens’ assemblies or reference panels, are one institutionalization of deliberative democracy that has become increasingly commonplace in recent years. MASS LBP is a pioneer in designing and facilitating such long-form deliberative processes in Canada. This article provides an overview of the company’s civic lottery and reference panel process, notes several distinctive features of MASS LBP that are relevant to addressing challenges to democratic deliberation, and outlines possible areas for future research in deliberative democracy applied in both private and public settings.","authors":["Spencer McKay","Peter MacLeod"],"meta":["December 2018Democratic Theory 5(2):108-113","DOI:10.3167/dt.2018.050209"],"references":[]}
