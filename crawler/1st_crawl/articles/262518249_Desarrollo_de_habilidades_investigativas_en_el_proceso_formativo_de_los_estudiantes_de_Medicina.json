In view of the insufficiencies of medical students on the research component during the training process, which bears on the ways the graduates perform, a descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted. The objective was to determine the behavior of research skills in the training process of medical students during January-June 2009. The universe was comprised of all the students enroll at Medical College in Pinar del Rio. The sample was chosen at random, stratified and representative, that included the medical students enroll in all the academic years of medical studies, teaching staff and directors. A literature review and a documentary analysis of the syllabuses were carried out using empirical methods: survey, interview and the opinion of the experts. The instruments applied included a survey to the medical students and semi-structured interviews to professors. Concluding that the majority of the students consider the topics about methodology of research insufficient to develop skills, these topics respond to personal interest advised by the tutor. Student scientific activity represents the main identified way to develop research skills. Students consider the discipline of Methodology of Research very necessary in the syllabus.","authors":["Guillermo Luís Herrera Miranda","Francisco López Góvea","Dania María Horta Muñoz"],"meta":["March 2010"],"references":[]}
