{"id":"261020282_3-Way_Software_Testing_with_Budget_Constraints","abstract":"This article deals with constructions of covering arrays which are extremely useful in software testing in order to guarantee 3-way coverage of parameter values, while trying to minimize the number of test cases. A practical limitation in the realm of testing is budget. In most software development environments, time, computing and human resources needed to perform the testing of a component is strictly limited. In order to deal with such situations, we consider the problem of creating the best possible test suite (covering the maximum number of 3-tuples) within a fixed number of test cases. This paper proposes a method of constructing strength three covering arrays with budget constraints.","authors":["Soumen Maity"],"meta":["September 2012IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems E95.D(9):258-262","DOI:10.1109/ITNG.2012.44","Conference: Information Technology: New Generations (ITNG), 2012 Ninth International Conference on","Project: Covering arrays and software testing"],"references":["255670789_A_Test_Generation_Algorithm_for_3Way_Software_Testing","255663058_Refining_the_In-Parameter-Order_Strategy_for_Constructing_Covering_Arrays","243782759_Factor-Covering_Designs_for_Testing_Software","227007076_Software_and_Hardware_Testing_Using_Combinatorial_Covering_Suites","312919796_Software_and_hardware_testing_using_combinatorial_covering_suitesGraph_Theory_Comb","275347337_A_Course_in_the_Theory_of_Groups","244448143_A_Course_in_the_Theory_of_Groups","232641099_In-Parameter-Order_A_Test_Generation_Strategy_for_Pairwise_Testing","227725288_On_the_state_of_strength-three_covering_arrays","227548537_Group_construction_of_covering_arrays","222666937_Problems_and_algorithms_for_covering_arrays","220638924_Covering_Arrays_of_Strength_Three","44250805_Combinatorial_aspects_of_covering_arrays","4195962_Improved_test_generation_algorithms_for_pair-wise_testing","220420559_Orthogonal_Latin_squares_an_application_of_experiment_design_to_compiler_testing"]}
