{"id":"311499912_Tsallis_Entropy_Properties_of_Order_Statistics_and_Some_Stochastic_Comparisons","abstract":"Tsallis entropy and order statistics are important in engineering reliability, image and signal processing. In this paper, we try to extend the concept of Tsallis entropy using order statistics. For this purpose, we propose the Tsallis entropy of order statistics and for it we obtain upper and lower bounds and some results on stochastic comparisons.","authors":["Simindokht Baratpour","Amirhamzeh Khammar"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Statistical Research of Iran 13(1):25-41","DOI:10.18869/acadpub.jsri.13.1.2","Project: Tsallis Entropy Properties of Order Statistics and Some Stochastic Comparisons"],"references":["274783492_Stochastic_Comparisons_of_Residual_Entropy_of_Order_Statistics_and_Some_Characterization_Results","265544494_Some_ordering_results_on_order_statistics_and_record_values","254206743_Convex-ordering_among_functions_with_applications_to_reliability_and_mathematical_statistics","324384619_A_First_Course_in_Order_Statistics","286334737_Stochastic_Comparisons_of_Cumulative_Entropies","284328541_Descriptive_statistics_for_nonparametric_models_II_Location","282695898_Fisher_information_in_order_statistics","257497147_On_location_scale_skewness_and_kurtosis_of_univariate_distributions","257338388_Generalized_cumulative_residual_entropy_and_record_values","254363691_Renyi_Entropy_Properties_of_Order_Statistics"]}
