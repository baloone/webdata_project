{"id":"223392969_Strategies_for_Interconnection_Networks_Some_Methods_from_Graph_Theory","abstract":"Interconnection networks require dense graphs in the sense that many nodes with relatively few links may be connected with relatively short paths. Some recent constructions of such dense graphs with a given maximal degree Δ and diameter D (known as (Δ, D) graphs) are reviewed here. The paper also contains an updated table of the best known (Δ, D) graphs.","authors":["Jean-Claude Bermond","Charles Delorme","Jean-Jacques Quisquater"],"meta":["December 1986Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing 3(4):433-449","DOI:10.1016/0743-7315(86)90008-0","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["266375464_Dense_compound_graphs","265997859_Grands_Graphes_De_Degre_Et_Diametre_Fixes","285240200_Bounds_on_directed_dk_graphs","273738590_Grands_Graphes_de_Degre_et_Diametre_Donnes","269020939_De_Bruijn_Sequences-A_Model_Example_of_the_Interaction_of_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Computer_Science","268833320_Interconnection_network_with_each_node_on_two_buses","268531261_Graphs_and_interconnection_networks_Diameter_and_vulnerability","266375304_Graphs_on_alphabets_as_models_for_large_computer_networks","265939026_On_the_construction_of_dk_graphs","250039044_Graphs_with_small_diameter_after"]}
