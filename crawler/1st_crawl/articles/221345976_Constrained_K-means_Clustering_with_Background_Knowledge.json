{"id":"221345976_Constrained_K-means_Clustering_with_Background_Knowledge","abstract":"Clustering is traditionally viewed as an unsupervised method for data analysis. However, in some cases information about the problem domain is available in addition to the data instances themselves. In this paper, we demonstrate how the popular k-means clustering algorithm can be pro tably modi- ed to make use of this information. In experiments with arti cial constraints on six data sets, we observe improvements in clustering accuracy. We also apply this method to the real-world problem of automatically detecting road lanes from GPS data and observe dramatic increases in performance. 1.","authors":["Kiri Wagstaff","Claire Cardie","Seth Rogers","Stefan Schr√∂dl"],"meta":["January 2001","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2001), Williams College, Williamstown, MA, USA, June 28 - July 1, 2001"],"references":["2458036_Constrained_K-Means_Clustering","271688629_359_Note_Classification_in_the_Presence_of_Constraints"]}
