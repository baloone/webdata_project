{"id":"272423134_Width_hierarchy_for_k-OBDD_of_small_width","abstract":"In this paper was explored well known model k-OBDD. There are proven width\nbased hierarchy of classes of boolean functions which computed by k-OBDD. The\nproof of hierarchy is based on sufficient condition of Boolean function's non\nrepresentation as k-OBDD and complexity properties of Boolean function SAF.\nThis function is modification of known Pointer Jumping (PJ) and Indirect\nStorage Access (ISA) functions.","authors":["Kamil Khadiev"],"meta":["February 2015Lobachevskii Journal of Mathematics 36(2)","DOI:10.1134/S1995080215020092","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262767609_Very_narrow_quantum_OBDDs_and_width_hierarchies_for_classical_OBDDs","249423703_On_the_Power_of_Randomized_Ordered_Branching_Programs","226130270_On_lower_bounds_for_read-k-times_branching_programs","225103104_Randomization_and_nondeterminism_are_comparable_for_ordered_read-once_branching_programs","257914138_Extension_of_the_hierarchy_for_k-OBDDs_of_small_width","238198448_Branching_Programs_and_Binary_Decision_Diagrams-Theory_and_Applications","225799968_On_the_power_of_randomized_branching_programs","225702900_An_Improved_Hierarchy_Result_for_Partitioned_BDDs","222485510_Hierarchy_theorems_for_kOBDDs_and_kIBDDs","222415055_On_the_computational_power_of_probabilistic_and_quantum_branching_program"]}
