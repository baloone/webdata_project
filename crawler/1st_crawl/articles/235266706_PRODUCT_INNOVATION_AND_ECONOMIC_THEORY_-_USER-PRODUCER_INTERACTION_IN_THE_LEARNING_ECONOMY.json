{"id":"235266706_PRODUCT_INNOVATION_AND_ECONOMIC_THEORY_-_USER-PRODUCER_INTERACTION_IN_THE_LEARNING_ECONOMY","abstract":"In this chapter it is shown that, in spite of the fundamental importance for economic growth of product innovation, standard economic theory – neo-classical as well as transaction cost approaches to industrial organization – tends to neglect it. It is also shown that moving the focus to product innovation leads to very different conclusions on how alternative institutional set-ups affect economic performance. Institutional set ups assumed to optimise allocation and minimise transaction costs do not support innovation and growth. That is why producer goods where innovation is a regular phenomenon are transacted neither in pure markets nor in hierarchies. The omnipresence of “organized markets” reflects the need for users as well as producers to engage in on-going information exchange and interactive learning in connection with product innovation.","authors":["Bengt-Åke Lundvall","Anker Lund Vinding"],"meta":["December 2004Research on Technological Innovation 8:101-128","DOI:10.1016/S0737-1071(04)08005-9"],"references":["247837052_An_Examination_of_Organizational_Factors_Influencing_New_Product_Success_in_Internal_and_Alliance-Based_Processes","235250431_Flying_Prototypes_Production_Departments'_DirectInteraction_with_External_Customers","222521761_Profiting_from_voluntary_information_SPILLOVERS_How_users_benefit_by_freely_revealing_their_innovations"]}
