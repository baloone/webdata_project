{"id":"323672016_Piecewise_asymptotically_almost_automorphic_solutions_for_impulsive_non-autonomous_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","abstract":"This paper is concerned with an impulsive non-autonomous high-order Hopfield neural network with mixed delays. Under proper conditions, we studied the existence, the uniqueness and the global exponential stability of asymptotic almost automorphic solutions for the suggested system. Our method was mainly based on the Banach’s fixed-point theorem and the generalized Gronwall–Bellman inequality. Moreover, four examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed findings.","authors":["Chaouki Aouiti","Farah Dridi"],"meta":["September 2019Neural Computing and Applications 31(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-018-3378-4","Project: Artificial neural networks"],"references":["316873499_Finite_time_boundedness_of_neutral_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_time_delay_in_the_leakage_term_and_mixed_time_delays","313679970_New_Results_for_Impulsive_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Coefficients_and_Mixed_Delays","311248710_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_for_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Leakage_Delays","308208061_Asymptotically_almost_automorphic_solution_of_high_order_recurrent_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","307613765_Neutral_impulsive_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_coefficients_and_leakage_delays","307598314_Oscillation_of_impulsive_neutral_delay_generalized_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks","306324493_Piecewise_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solution_for_Impulsive_Generalised_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_Leakage_Delays","321291345_Impulsive_generalised_high-order_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_mixed_delays_Stability_and_periodicity","308314849_Weighted_pseudo_almost-periodic_solutions_of_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","308208005_Pseudo_almost_periodic_solutions_of_impulsive_recurrent_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","299359873_Pseudo_Almost_Automorphic_Solutions_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Coefficients_and_Mixed_Delays","303398165_Global_Mittag-Leffler_stability_of_complex_valued_fractional-order_neural_network_with_discrete_and_distributed_delays","295559223_Almost_Automorphic_Solutions_of_Impulsive_Cellular_Neural_Networks_with_Piecewise_Constant_Argument","288221137_Exponential_stability_analysis_for_switched_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays_and_impulsive_effects","288220973_Exponential_stability_analysis_for_switched_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays_and_impulsive_effects"]}
