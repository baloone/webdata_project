{"id":"351522422_Fractional_metric_dimension_of_metal-organic_frameworks","abstract":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOF(n)) are organic-inorganic hybrid crystalline porous materials that consist of a regular array of positively charged metal ions surrounded by organic ‘linker’ molecules. The metal ions form nodes that bind the arms of the linkers together to form a repeating, cage-like structure. Moreover, in a chemical structure or molecular graph, edges and vertices are known as bonds and atoms, respectively. Metric dimension being a subsets of atoms with minimum cardinality is used in the substrcturing of the chemical compounds in the molecular structures. Fractional metric dimension is weighted version of metric dimension that associate a numeric value to the identified subset of atoms. In this paper, we have computed the fractional metric dimension of metal organic framework (MOF(n)) for n ≡ 0( mod )2.","authors":["Mohsin Raza","Muhammad Javaid","Naeem Saleem"],"meta":["May 2021Main Group Metal Chemistry 44(1):92-102","DOI:10.1515/mgmc-2021-0012"],"references":["346894724_Sharp_Bounds_of_Local_Fractional_Metric_Dimensions_of_Connected_Networks","330490436_Fractional_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Jahangir_Graph","312284531_Application_of_Metal-organic_Frameworks","265889329_The_metric_dimension_and_metric_independence_of_a_graph","346975875_On_sharp_bounds_of_the_Partition_Dimension_of_Convex_Polytoes","341093777_Local_Fractional_Metric_Dimensions_of_Rotationally_Symmetric_and_Planar_Networks","329051966_Metal-organic_frameworks_Structures_and_functional_applications","272372827_The_fractional_metric_dimension_of_permutation_graphs","266148704_Removal_of_hazardous_organics_from_water_using_metal-organic_frameworks_MOFs_Plausible_mechanisms_for_selective_adsorptions","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph"]}
