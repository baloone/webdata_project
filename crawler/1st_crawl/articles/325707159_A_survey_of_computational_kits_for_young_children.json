{"id":"325707159_A_survey_of_computational_kits_for_young_children","abstract":"This paper presents a survey of computational kits that enable young children (ages 7 years old and under) to explore computing ideas and practices. We examined physical, virtual, and hybrid kits across three different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, and how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities. Based on our analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in how children can engage in computing, what kinds of projects children can make, and what kinds of computational ideas children can explore.","authors":["Junnan Yu","Ricarose Roque"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1145/3202185.3202738","Conference: the 17th ACM Conference"],"references":["325088260_Promoting_Computational_Thinking_in_children_Using_Apps","303943002_A_Framework_for_Computational_Thinking_Based_on_a_Systematic_Research_Review","274309848_Computational_Thinking","267805436_Robo-Blocks_A_Tangible_Programming_System_with_Debugging_for_Children","265797241_New_frameworks_for_studying_and_assessing_the_development_of_computational_thinking","247589124_Some_reflections_on_designing_construction_kits_for_kids","239761488_Robo-Blocks_designing_debugging_abilities_in_a_tangible_programming_system_for_early_primary_school_children","232539181_Effects_of_Computer_Programming_on_Young_Children's_Cognition","229049520_Curlybot_designing_a_new_class_of_computational_toys","225776146_Tangible_interaction_and_learning_The_case_for_a_hybrid_approach","221519244_A_physical_interface_for_system_dynamics_simulation","221518653_Topobo_a_constructive_assembly_system_with_kinetic_memory","221513788_Comparing_the_use_of_tangible_and_graphical_programming_languages_for_informal_science_education","221238490_Tangible_programming_and_informal_science_learning_making_TUIs_work_for_museums","221238448_Children's_programming_reconsidered_Settings_stuff_and_surfaces","220420371_Computational_thinking","43462811_Electronic_blocks_Tangible_programming_elements_for_preschoolers","345062231_Participatory_Design_with_Children_in_the_Autism_Spectrum","326840767_Coding_as_a_Playground_Programming_and_Computational_Thinking_in_the_Early_Childhood_Classroom","321100067_Impacts_of_Early_Childhood_Education_on_Medium-_and_Long-Term_Educational_Outcomes","317927896_Interactive_fiction_Weaving_together_literacies_of_text_and_code","317422613_Enabling_Collaboration_in_Learning_Computer_Programing_Inclusive_of_Children_with_Vision_Impairments","314721698_A_physical_interface_for_system_dynamics_simulation","313572690_Comparing_the_use_of_tangible_and_graphical_programming_languages_for_informal_science_education","303658153_Remixing_as_a_Pathway_to_Computational_Thinking","300490038_KIBO_robot_demo","300490037_Strawbies","283802468_Augmented_reality-based_video-modeling_storybook_of_nonverbal_facial_cues_for_children_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_to_improve_their_perceptions_and_judgments_of_facial_expressions_and_emotions","279816728_Exploring_real-time_video_interactivity_with_Scratch","274523862_Adding_reinforced_corners","262401412_Dr_Wagon_A_'stretchable'_toolkit_for_tangible_computer_programming","262253499_Designing_ScratchJr_support_for_early_childhood_learning_through_computer_programming","262238105_The_Digital_Dream_Lab_Tabletop_puzzle_blocks_for_exploring_programmatic_concepts","262164892_Dancing_Alice_Exploring_embodied_pedagogical_strategies_for_learning_computational_thinking","261862159_Translating_Roberto_to_Omar_computational_literacy_stickerbooks_and_cultural_forms","242593698_Tangible_Programming_Bricks_An_approach_to_making_programming_accessible_to_everyone","221052392_RoBlocks_A_robotic_construction_kit_for_mathematics_and_science_education","220141368_From_turtles_to_Tangible_Programming_Bricks_Explorations_in_physical_language_design","33764310_Topobo_a_3-D_constructive_assembly_system_with_kinetic_memory"]}
