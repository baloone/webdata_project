{"id":"292664141_Disassembly_Scheduling_with_Parts_Commonality_Using_Petri_Nets_with_Timestamps","abstract":"This paper considers the application of Petri nets with timestamps to the problem of disassembly scheduling with parts commonality, which is the problem of determining time and quantity of ordering the used product to fulfill the demands of individual disassembled parts. Unlike the simple case, parts commonality creates dependencies of components and makes them difficult to solve. A comparison of methods using an example problem from a previous research shows that the method suggested in this paper is much simpler and more extendable than the previous one. Also, we show that the solutions obtained from the previous algorithm are not optimal in general.","authors":["Klaus-Peter Neuendorf","D.-H.
