{"id":"330076768_Cryptography_using_Random_Rc4_Stream_Cipher_on_SMS_for_Android-Based_Smartphones","abstract":"Messages sent using the default Short Message Service (SMS) application have to pass the SMS Center (SMSC) to record the communication between the sender and recipient. Therefore, the message security is not guaranteed because it may read by irresponsible people. This research proposes the RC4 stream cipher method for security in sending SMS. However, RC4 has any limitation in the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and Pseudo Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA) phases. Therefore, this research developed RC4 with a random initial state to increase the randomness level of the keystream. This SMS cryptography method applied the processes of encryption against the sent SMS followed by decryption against the received SMS. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated based on the time of encryption and decryption as well as the average correlation value. Based on the time, it shows that the length of the SMS characters sent affects the time of encryption and decryption. Meanwhile, the best correlation value achieved 0.00482.
