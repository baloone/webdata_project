{"id":"339183010_A_Robust_Levitation_Control_of_Maglev_Vehicles_Subject_to_Time_Delay_and_Disturbances_Design_and_Hardware_Experimentation","abstract":"Maglev vehicles have become a new type of transportation system with higher speed, lower noise, and commercial appeal. Magnetic-suspension systems, which have high nonlinearity and open-loop instability, are the core components of maglev vehicles. The high-performance control of maglev vehicles has been the focus of numerous studies. Encountering challenges in the levitation control of maglev vehicles in the form of uncertain time delays and disturbances is unavoidable. To cope with these problems, this study presents the design of an adaptive robust controller based on the Riccati method and sliding-mode technology, simultaneously taking into account the influence of time delays and disturbances. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with the proposed control law is proved by the Lyapunov method. Control performances of the proposed controller are shown in the simulation results. Together with the consistently stabilizing outputs, the presented control approach can handle time delays and disturbances well. Finally, experiments were also implemented to examine its practical control performance of the robust levitation-control law.","authors":["You-gang Sun","Si Xie","Jun-qi Xu","Guo-bin Lin"],"meta":["February 2020Applied Sciences 10(3):1179","DOI:10.3390/app10031179"],"references":["338676392_Adaptive_integral_sliding_mode_control_with_payload_sway_reduction_for_4-DOF_tower_crane_systems","337616497_Modeling_and_energy-based_sway_reduction_control_for_tower_crane_systems_with_double-pendulum_and_spherical-pendulum_effects","336970547_A_new_overhead_crane_emergency_braking_method_with_theoretical_analysis_and_experimental_verification","338589645_Nonlinear_Motion_Control_of_Complicated_Dual_Rotary_Crane_Systems_Without_Velocity_Feedback_Design_Analysis_and_Hardware_Experiments","336571272_Nonlinear_Control_of_Underactuated_Systems_Subject_to_Both_Actuated_and_Unactuated_State_Constraints_With_Experimental_Verification","336310446_Model-based_model_predictive_control_for_a_direct-driven_permanent_magnet_synchronous_generator_with_internal_and_external_disturbances","333884127_Adaptive_Control_for_Pneumatic_Artificial_Muscle_Systems_With_Parametric_Uncertainties_and_Unidirectional_Input_Constraints","332923546_Neural_Network-Based_Adaptive_Antiswing_Control_of_an_Underactuated_Ship-Mounted_Crane_With_Roll_Motions_and_Input_Dead_Zones","330371881_Adaptive_Neural-Fuzzy_Robust_Position_Control_Scheme_for_Maglev_Train_Systems_With_Experimental_Verification","324255165_Adaptive_robust_constrained_state_control_for_nonlinear_maglev_vehicle_with_guaranteed_bounded_airgap"]}
