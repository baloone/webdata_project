{"id":"289734479_Transforming_UML_class_diagrams_into_HBase_based_on_meta-model","abstract":"In order to reduce the influence of requirement change for software development and improve the efficiency and portability of software development efficiently, this paper, based on the ideas of Model Driven Architecture (MDA), proposes a method that transforms UML class diagrams into HBase based on Meta-model. The method achieves the transformation from Platform Independent Model (PIM) to Platform Specific Model (PSM) on the meta-model level and is comprised of three phases. In the first phase, the meta-models of UML class diagram and HBase database are built. In the second phase, the mapping rules between the two meta-models are proposed. In the last phase, the UML class diagram is built and the HBase database model is generated by transformation. At last, the paper uses Atlas language to achieve a breakfast serving system to prove the feasibility of the MDA in the software development.","authors":["Yan Li","Ping Gu","Chao Zhang"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1109/InfoSEEE.2014.6947760"],"references":["2956474_Model-Driven_Development_Using_UML_20_Promises_and_Pitfalls","261454553_Research_of_relational_model_transformation_based_on_ATL","251947268_Transforming_relational_database_into_HBase_A_case_study","242396009_Model_Driven_Architecture_Applying_MDA_to_Enterprise_Computing","234827556_MDA_Explained_The_Model_Driven_Architecture_Practice_and_Promise"]}
