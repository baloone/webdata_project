{"id":"232593787_Course_work_characteristics_and_students'_satisfaction_with_instruction","abstract":"Examined the degree to which instructional satisfaction (IS) is affected by course work variables, including task clarity, challenge, identity, task feedback, professors' feedback, and autonomy. 140 health professionals participating in 2 academic programs at a small university were sampled; Ss' satisfaction was measured by an instrument derived from T. J. Keaveny and A. F. McGann (1978). The 7 core dimensions of course work characteristics accounted for 35% of the explained variation in IS. Three dominant predictors of IS were found: clarity of instruction, professors' feedback, and identity of instructional tasks. A preliminary causal model of IS determinants was constructed, and the major determinant of IS suggested by this model was professors' feedback.
