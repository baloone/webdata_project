Nevertheless, curry out of Star/Delta Starter control circuit on synchronous and induction usually want additional exertion and efforts and it was not relaxed to execute in universal profitable workstations or distant arenas. On the opposing, execution of Star/Delta Starter control circuit in the Programable Logic Control (PLC) is proposed a method to be executed and recognized its mechanisms of this work that consider as peripherals to the PLC. The using type of PLC (Pico) would be selected for this goal. Facilitating of software design circuit inscribed codes produced by ladder linguistic and applied by software name's Picosoft version 6 for this project case. Many developing nations started consuming PLC in its manufacturing arena recently. In this paper, there is a providing for simulation, circuit diagram and communication for Star/Delta Starter control circuit by PLC and its result on board separately.","authors":["Ali Thaeer Hammid","Omar A.
