{"id":"340832905_The_extended_and_folded_conformers_of_the_AlaAla_dipeptide_isolated_in_the_gas_phase","abstract":"Herein we present the first rotational study of the isolated AlaAla dipeptide, placed in the gas phase by laser ablation. Two different structures have been unveiled in the isolated environment of a supersonic expansion by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. These structures have been identified through their rotational and 14N quadrupole coupling constants. The flexibility of the -NH2 and -COOH ends allow the formation of strong intramolecular interactions closing five- and seven-membered ring configurations.","authors":["Iker león","Elena Rita Alonso","Santiago Mata","José L Alonso"],"meta":["April 2020Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics 22(25)","DOI:10.1039/D0CP01043J"],"references":["319196658_The_role_of_amino_acid_side_chains_in_stabilizing_dipeptides_The_laser_ablation_Fourier_transform_microwave_spectrum_of_Ac-Val-NH2","279634038_Fourier_Transform_Microwave_Spectroscopy_of_Ac-Ser-NH2_The_Role_of_the_Side_Chain_Interactions_in_Peptide_Folding","264567556_The_alanine_model_dipeptide_Ac-Ala-NH2_exists_as_a_mixture_of_Ceq7_and_C5_conformers","257822936_The_conformational_behaviour_of_free_D-glucose_-at_last","43347348_A_Consistent_and_Accurate_Ab_Initio_Parametrization_of_Density_Functional_Dispersion_Correction_DFT-D_for_the_94_Elements_H-Pu","335405225_Unveiling_the_Neutral_Forms_of_Glutamine","331599729_The_Rotational_Spectrum_of_Saccharin_Structure_and_Sweetness","331555413_Competition_between_folded_and_extended_structures_of_alanylalanine_Ala-Ala_in_a_molecular_beam","328907202_The_shape_of_the_simplest_non-proteinogenic_amino_acid_a-aminoisobutyric_Aib","316565550_The_Structure_of_the_Elusive_Simplest_Dipeptide_Gly-Gly","313442561_Microwave_Molecular_Spectra","295077529_A_Structural_Expression_of_Exo-Anomeric_Effect","272196817_The_Nucleoside_Uridine_Isolated_in_the_Gas_Phase","264983896_Tautomerism_in_Neutral_Histidine","252763589_Relaxation_of_conformers_and_isomers_in_seeded_supersonic_jets_of_inert_gases","250827306_A_new_micelle-forming_peptide","244508751_Conformers_of_the_peptides_glycine-tryptophan_tryptophan-glycine_and_tryptophan-glycine-glycine_as_revealed_by_double_resonance_laser_spectroscopy","239737821_The_structure_of_the_gas-phase_tyrosine-glycine_dipeptide","234912067_Self-consistent_molecular_orbital_methods_25_Supplementary_functions_for_Gaussian_basis_sets","231662875_Laser_Ablation_of_Trp-Gly","230630029_A_New_Mixing_of_Hartree-Fock_and_Local_Density_Functional_Theories","228844607_NCIPLOT_A_program_for_plotting_noncovalent_interaction_regions","228650188_Density_Functionals_for_Noncovalent_Interaction_Energies_of_Biological_Importance","223657485_REMPI_and_UV-UV_double_resonance_spectroscopy_of_tryptophan_ethylester_and_the_dipeptides_tryptophan-serine_glycine-tryptophan_and_proline-tryptophan","223328977_The_missing_conformers_of_glycine_and_alanine_Relaxation_in_seeded_supersonic_jets","223301786_The_fitting_and_prediction_of_vibration-rotation_spectra_with_spin_interactions","43158977_Revealing_Non-Covalent_Interactions","30760708_Note_on_an_Approximation_Treatment_for_Many-Electron_Systems","13387860_Density-Functional_Exchange-Energy_Approximation_With_Correct_Asymptotic_Behavior","10992187_The_Structure_of_Neutral_Proline","8046858_Spectroscopic_Evidence_for_Gas-Phase_Formation_of_Successive_b-Turns_in_a_Three-Residue_Peptide_Chain","8043192_Folding_Structures_of_Isolated_Peptides_as_Revealed_by_Gas-Phase_Mid-Infrared_Spectroscopy","6566090_On_the_derivation_of_propensity_scales_for_predicting_exposed_transmembrane_residues_of_helical_membrane_proteins","6415231_Mid-_and_Near-Infrared_Spectra_of_Conformers_of_H-Pro-Trp-OH","5386644_IRUV_spectra_and_quantum_chemical_calculations_of_Trp-Ser_Stacking_interactions_between_backbone_and_indole_side-chain"]}
