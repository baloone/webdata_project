{"id":"324329156_The_chromatic_number_of_the_plane_is_at_least_5","abstract":"We present a family of finite unit-distance graphs in the plane that are not 4-colourable, thereby improving the lower bound of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem. The smallest such graph that we have so far discovered has 1567 vertices.","authors":["Aubrey de Grey"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["284903059_Solution_to_problem_10","274636135_The_Mathematical_Coloring_Book"]}
