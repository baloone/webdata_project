Based on a reconnaissance soil survey, 52 soil series were selected and different physical and chemical properties were determined. Five soil parameters including clay, cation exchange capacity, calcium carbonate equivalent, electrical conductivity, and organic carbon were chosen for analysis. Mapping was developed with the kriging method for each parameter. Different fuzzy membership functions were employed and weights for all parameters were calculated according to AHP. Finally, KSP classes were provided for each land unit. Results indicated that about 60% of the studied area is classified as having moderate to high KSP content (>3%) and 40% of had low or very low KSP content (<3%). Then 15 sample points were used for determination of the accuracy of the fuzzy method. Results showed that the fuzzy and AHP methods have a high accuracy for KSP estimation in the studied soils. Further development of the fuzzy and AHP methods would be worthwhile for improving the accuracy of KSP analysis.","authors":["Marzieh Mokarram","Mahdi Najafi Ghiri"],"meta":["December 2016Agriculture 6(4):59","DOI:10.3390/agriculture6040059"],"references":["276885270_Prioritization_of_Sub_Watershed_Based_on_Morphometric_Characteristics_Using_Fuzzy_Analytical_Hierarchy_Process_and_Geographical_Information_System_-_A_Study_of_Kallar_Watershed_Tamil_Nadu","254218067_Factors_affecting_potassium_release_in_calcareous_soils_of_southern_Iran","249060653_Application_of_analytical_hierarchy_process_and_geographic_information_systems_in_land-use_suitability_evaluation_A_case_study_of_Dumrek_village_Canakkale_Turkey","242137089_Potassium_status_in_some_Lebanese_soils","322137662_Combination_of_Fuzzy_and_AHP_methods_to_assess_land_suitability_for_barley_Case_Study_of_semi_arid_lands_in_the_southwest_of_Iran","306202221_Total_carbon_organic_carbon_and_organic_matter","287248567_The_use_of_fuzzy-_AHP_methods_to_assess_fertility_classes_for_wheat_and_its_relationship_with_soil_salinity_East_of_Shiraz_Iran_A_case_study","280960483_Soil_Fertility_and_Fertilizers","259204955_Application_of_analytical_hierarchy_process_for_effective_selection_of_agricultural_best_management_practices","250789628_Cation_Exchange_Capacity_of_Activated_Sludge"]}
