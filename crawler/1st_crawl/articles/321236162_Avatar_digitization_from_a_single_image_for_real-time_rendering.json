{"id":"321236162_Avatar_digitization_from_a_single_image_for_real-time_rendering","abstract":"We present a fully automatic framework that digitizes a complete 3D head with hair from a single unconstrained image. Our system offers a practical and consumer-friendly end-to-end solution for avatar personalization in gaming and social VR applications. The reconstructed models include secondary components (eyes, teeth, tongue, and gums) and provide animation-friendly blendshapes and joint-based rigs. While the generated face is a high-quality textured mesh, we propose a versatile and efficient polygonal strips (polystrips) representation for the hair. Polystrips are suitable for an extremely wide range of hairstyles and textures and are compatible with existing game engines for real-time rendering. In addition to integrating state-of-the-art advances in facial shape modeling and appearance inference, we propose a novel single-view hair generation pipeline, based on 3D-model and texture retrieval, shape refinement, and polystrip patching optimization. The performance of our hairstyle retrieval is enhanced using a deep convolutional neural network for semantic hair attribute classification. Our generated models are visually comparable to state-of-the-art game characters designed by professional artists. For real-time settings, we demonstrate the flexibility of polystrips in handling hairstyle variations, as opposed to conventional strand-based representations. We further show the effectiveness of our approach on a large number of images taken in the wild, and how compelling avatars can be easily created by anyone.","authors":["Liwen Hu","Hao Li","Shunsuke Saito","Lingyu Wei"],"meta":["November 2017ACM Transactions on Graphics 36(6):1-14","DOI:10.1145/3130800.31310887"],"references":["322649235_MoFA_Model-Based_Deep_Convolutional_Face_Autoencoder_for_Unsupervised_Monocular_Reconstruction","322057505_MoFA_Model-Based_Deep_Convolutional_Face_Autoencoder_for_Unsupervised_Monocular_Reconstruction","315712128_MoFA_Model-based_Deep_Convolutional_Face_Autoencoder_for_Unsupervised_Monocular_Reconstruction","311411333_Photorealistic_Facial_Texture_Inference_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks","310441215_Learning_Detailed_Face_Reconstruction_from_a_Single_Image","308277656_Real-Time_Facial_Segmentation_and_Performance_Capture_from_RGB_Input","301876346_Real-Time_Facial_Segmentation_and_Performance_Capture_from_RGB_Input","281101815_Facial-Performance-Sensing_Head-Mounted_Display","274056275_Capturing_and_Stylizing_Hair_for_3D_Fabrication","270967182_The_Chicago_face_database_A_free_stimulus_set_of_faces_and_norming_data","268988287_Deep_Learning_Face_Attributes_in_the_Wild","328841009_Computer_facial_animation_second_edition","320971644_Neural_Face_Editing_with_Intrinsic_Image_Disentangling","320971509_Learning_Detailed_Face_Reconstruction_from_a_Single_Image","320968231_Photorealistic_Facial_Texture_Inference_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","318780009_Hair_Meshes","318740272_Pinscreen_creating_performance-driven_avatars_in_seconds","314784965_Example-based_facial_rigging","314765793_Coupled_3D_reconstruction_of_sparse_facial_hair_and_skin","311610841_Image_Style_Transfer_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","311610666_A_3D_Morphable_Model_Learnt_from_10000_Faces","311610313_Face2Face_Real-Time_Face_Capture_and_Reenactment_of_RGB_Videos","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","309961624_Corrective_3D_reconstruction_of_lips_from_monocular_video","309957345_Model-based_teeth_reconstruction","309957254_High-fidelity_facial_and_speech_animation_for_VR_HMDs","309008762_FaceVR_Real-Time_Facial_Reenactment_and_Eye_Gaze_Control_in_Virtual_Reality","308862879_Unconstrained_realtime_facial_performance_capture","308278054_Head_Reconstruction_from_Internet_Photos","305455475_Demo_of_Face2Face_real-time_face_capture_and_reenactment_of_RGB_videos","305218338_Real-time_Facial_Animation_with_Image-based_Dynamic_Avatars","305218295_Lightweight_eye_capture_using_a_parametric_model","305218174_AutoHair_Fully_Automatic_Hair_Modeling_from_A_Single_Image","303357253_Reconstruction_of_Personalized_3D_Face_Rigs_from_Monocular_Video","301426255_Skinning","292002681_Rendering_fur_with_three_dimensional_textures_In_Proceedings_of_the_16th_Annual_Conference_on_Computer_Graphics_and_interactive_Techniques_SIGGRAPH_'89_ACM_Press","287049687_A_mass_spring_model_for_hair_simulation","286245704_Automatic_Acquisition_of_High-fidelity_Facial_Performances_Using_Monocular_Videos","285818413_Sedimentary_characteristics_of_Core_YE-2_from_the_central_mud_area_in_the_South_Yellow_Sea_during_last_8400_years_and_its_interspace_coarse_layers","283450602_High-Quality_Hair_Modeling_from_A_Single_Portrait_Photo","283402610_Capturing_Braided_Hairstyles","283159135_Face_Alignment_at_3000_FPS_via_Regressing_Local_Binary_Features","282434021_Single-View_Hair_Modeling_Using_A_Hairstyle_Database","282414621_Dynamic_3D_Avatar_Creation_from_Hand-held_Video_Input","277679310_Displaced_Dynamic_Expression_Regression_for_Real-time_Facial_Tracking_and_Animation","277679213_Robust_Hair_Capture_Using_Simulated_Examples","277402606_Reconstructing_Detailed_Dynamic_Face_Geometry_from_Monocular_Video","275482934_A_Reduced_Model_for_Interactive_Hairs","266659591_Skinning_real-time_shape_deformation_full_text_not_available","264419855_One_Millisecond_Face_Alignment_with_an_Ensemble_of_Regression_Trees","262412552_Internet_Based_Morphable_Model","266659490_Digital_ira_and_beyond_creating_real-time_photoreal_digital_actors","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","263339091_Hair_Interpolation_for_Portrait_Morphing"]}
