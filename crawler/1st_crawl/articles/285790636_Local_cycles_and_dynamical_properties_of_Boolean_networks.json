{"id":"285790636_Local_cycles_and_dynamical_properties_of_Boolean_networks","abstract":"We investigate the relationships between the dynamical properties of Boolean networks and properties of their Jacobian matrices, in particular the existence of local cycles in the associated interaction graphs. We define the notion of hereditarily bijective maps, and we use it to strengthen the property of unicity of a fixed point and to provide simplified proofs and generalizations of theorems relating attractors to the existence of local cycles, in particular local positive cycles. We then argue that this notion may not suffice to prove, under a suitable hypothesis such as the existence of a cyclic attractor or a stronger hypothesis, the existence of local negative cycles. We then consider a class of Boolean networks called and-or-nets, and for this class, we prove that the hypothesis of an antipodal attractive cycle implies the existence of a local negative cycle.","authors":["PAUL RUET"],"meta":["November 2014Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 26(4):1-17","DOI:10.1017/S096012951400036X"],"references":["222829692_Negative_circuits_and_sustained_oscillations_in_asynchronous_automata_networks","38390367_The_Jacobian_Conjecture_Reduction_of_degree_and_formal_expansion_of_the_inverse","10732808_Multistationarity_the_basis_of_cell_differentiation_and_memory_I_Structural_conditions_of_multistationarity_and_other_nontrivial_behavior","302381450_On_Differentiation_and_Homeostatic_Behaviours_of_Boolean_Dynamical_Systems","257180623_The_discrete_Markus-Yamabe_problem1","257000789_From_kernels_in_directed_graphs_to_fixed_points_and_negative_cycles_in_Boolean_networks","241024051_Derivation_of_Vector-Valued_Boolean_Functions","223067330_A_combinatorial_analogue_of_the_Jacobian_problem_in_automata_networks","222578735_Graphic_requirements_for_multistability_and_attractive_cycles_in_a_Boolean_dynamical_framework","18578234_Boolean_formalization_of_genetic_control_circuits","17383444_Metabolic_Stability_and_Epigenisis_in_Randomly_Connected_Genetic_Nets"]}
