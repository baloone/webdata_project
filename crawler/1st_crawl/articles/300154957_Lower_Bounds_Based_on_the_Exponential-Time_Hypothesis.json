{"id":"300154957_Lower_Bounds_Based_on_the_Exponential-Time_Hypothesis","abstract":"The Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) is a conjecture stating that, roughly speaking, n-variable 3-SAT cannot be solved in time 2o(n). In this chapter, we prove lower bounds based on ETH for the time needed to solve various problems. In many cases, these lower bounds match (up to small factors) the running time of the best known algorithms for the problem.","authors":["Marek Cygan","Fedor V.
