{"id":"313825431_Can_dissonance_engineering_improve_risk_analysis_of_human-machine_systems","abstract":"The paper discusses dissonance engineering and its application to risk analysis of human–machine systems. Dissonance engineering relates to sciences and technologies relevant to dissonances, defined as conflicts between knowledge. The richness of the concept of dissonance is illustrated by a taxonomy that covers a variety of cognitive and organisational dissonances based on different conflict modes and baselines of their analysis. Knowledge control is discussed and related to strategies for accepting or rejecting dissonances. This acceptability process can be justified by a risk analysis of dissonances which takes into account their positive and negative impacts and several assessment criteria. A risk analysis method is presented and discussed along with practical examples of application. The paper then provides key points to motivate the development of risk analysis methods dedicated to dissonances in order to identify the balance between the positive and negative impacts and to improve the design and use of future human–machine system by reinforcing knowledge.","authors":["Vanderhaegen Frédéric","Oliver Carsten"],"meta":["February 2017Cognition Technology and Work 19(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10111-017-0405-7","Project: Dissonance engineering and risk analysis"],"references":["308018019_A_rule-based_support_system_for_dissonance_discovery_and_control_applied_to_car_driving","298886946_Cooperative_system_organisation_and_task_allocation_Illustration_of_task_allocation_in_air_traffic_control","292251059_Social_representation_theory","280929716_Dissonance_Engineering_A_New_Challenge_to_Analyse_Risky_Knowledge_When_using_a_System","324352933_The_Ecological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","287025926_Towards_Zero_Ambitious_Road_Safety_Targets_and_the_Safe_System_Approach","286961455_Being_transparent_about_transparency_A_model_for_human-robot_interaction","284761345_A_typology_of_resilience_situations","279235738_Why_anamorphoses_look_as_they_do---An_experimental-study","273630665_Examination_of_relationships_among_serendipity_the_environment_and_individual_differences"]}
