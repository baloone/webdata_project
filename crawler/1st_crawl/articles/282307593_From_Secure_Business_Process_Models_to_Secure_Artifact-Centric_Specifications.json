{"id":"282307593_From_Secure_Business_Process_Models_to_Secure_Artifact-Centric_Specifications","abstract":"Making todayâ€™s systems secure is an extremely difficult and challenging problem. Socio and technical issues interplay and contribute in creating vulnerabilities that cannot be easily prevented without a comprehensive engineering method. This paper presents a novel approach to support process-aware secure systems modeling and automated generation of secure artifact-centric implementations. It combines social and technical perspectives in developing secure systems. This work is the result of an academic and industrial collaboration, where SecBPMN2, a research prototype, has been integrated with SAP River, an industrial artifact-centric language.","authors":["Mattia Salnitri","Achim D.
