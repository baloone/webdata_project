{"id":"332332854_Performance_Evaluation_of_Supervised_Learning_for_Iris_Flower_Species","abstract":"Machine Learning is a field of computer science provides the ability to learn without programming and the program explicitly. Supervised Machine Learning (SML) is the search for algorithms that reason from externally supplied instances to produce general hypotheses, which then make predictions about future instances. Classification and Regression is a supervised learning in which the response is categorical that is its values are in finite Discrete and continuous set. To simply the problem of classification, scikit learn tools has been used. This paper focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. In this paper we will train the machine learning model with the given Iris Dataset and Analysis the performance and accuracy of Iris with Supervised Learning Algorithms","authors":["Shivam Vatshayan"],"meta":["April 2019"],"references":["319313534_Comparative_Study_of_Four_Supervised_Machine_Learning_Techniques_for_Classification","270895040_International_Journal_of_Advanced_Networking_Applications_IJANA_Performance_Analysis_of_Supervised_Techniques_for_Review_Spam_Detection","221613897_Inductive_Learning_Algorithms_and_Representations_for_Text_Categorization","221604720_Feature_Selection_in_SVM_Text_Categorization","344070957_Research_Challenge_on_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","285278428_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features","271425666_An_efficient_Neuro-Fuzzy_Approach_for_classification_of_Iris_Dataset","267161621_Principles_of_Data_Mining","254034062_A_method_for_sorting_out_the_spam_from_Chinese_product_reviews","220688795_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques"]}
