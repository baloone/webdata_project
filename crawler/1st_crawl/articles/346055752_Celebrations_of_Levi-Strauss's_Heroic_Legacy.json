{"id":"346055752_Celebrations_of_Levi-Strauss's_Heroic_Legacy","abstract":"Among the numerous stellar thinkers, whose contributions over the past century had revolutionary impacts upon the theoretical foundations of anthropology, there is almost none comparable with Claude Lévi-Strauss.\nIn this review article, a critical argument is presented against some recent grandiloquent and single-minded narratives of his work and life, while especially in light of his later writings, Lévi-Strauss's scientific legacy is supported as eminently relevant to the contemporary world plagued by fundamentalist threats of cultural, racial, political, ecological, and now even viral crises.","authors":["Albert Doja"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 26(4):864-871","DOI:10.1111/1467-9655.13366"],"references":["322753211_Social_Morphodynamics_Mapping_Identity_Transformations_Cultural_Encounters_and_the_Evolution_of_Core_Values","345264958_Par-dela_le_structuralisme_Maurice_Godelier_lecteur_materialiste_de_Claude_Levi-Strauss","334725850_Levi-Strauss_Two_lives","331300566_The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World_On_the_Possibility_of_Life_in_Capitalist_Ruins","327418751_Levi-Strauss_Biographie_definitive","325148364_We_Are_All_Cannibals_and_Other_Essays_by_Claude_Levi-Strauss","320182343_Face_a_Gaia_huit_conferences_sur_le_nouveau_regime_climatique","316937701_Une_merveille_definitive_de_l'art_biographique_Une_statue_ou_une_statuette","297476050_The_Cambridge_Companion_to_Levi-Strauss","276193693_Adieu_a_la_structure"]}
