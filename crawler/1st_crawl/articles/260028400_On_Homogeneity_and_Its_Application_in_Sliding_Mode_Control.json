{"id":"260028400_On_Homogeneity_and_Its_Application_in_Sliding_Mode_Control","abstract":"The paper is reviewing the tools to handle high-order sliding mode design and robustness. The main ingredient is homogeneity which can be checked using an algebraic test and which helps us in obtaining one of the most desired property in sliding mode control that is finite-time stability. This paper stresses some recently obtained results about homogeneity for differential inclusions and robustness with respect to perturbations in the context of input-to-state stability. Lastly within this framework, most of the popular high-order sliding mode control schemas are analyzed.","authors":["Emmanuel Bernuau","Denis Efimov","Wilfrid Perruquetti","Andrey Polyakov"],"meta":["April 2014Journal of the Franklin Institute 351(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.jfranklin.2014.01.007"],"references":["292137519_Uniform_Robust_Exact_Differentiator","279257573_Robustness_of_finite-time_stability_property_for_sliding_modes","262202328_Stabilization_via_homogeneous_feedback_controls","261484098_On_an_extension_of_homogeneity_notion_for_differential_inclusions","261483512_On_ISS_and_iISS_properties_of_homogeneous_systems","261051784_Finite-time_output_stabilization_of_the_double_integrator","260708574_Nonlinear_Feedback_Design_for_Fixed-Time_Stabilization_of_Linear_Control_Systems","254057753_Strict_Lyapunov_Functions_for_the_Super-Twisting_Algorithm","254054712_Oscillating_system_design_applying_universal_formula_for_control","253785103_Higher-order_sliding_modes_differentiation_and_output-feedback_control","251806428_Quasicontinuous_high-order_sliding-mode_controllers","251303665_Finite-Time_Stability_and_Stabilization_State_of_the_Art","245320898_Sliding_regimes_in_general_non-linear_systems_a_relative_degree_approach","243093489_Stabilizability_Does_Not_Imply_Homogeneous_Stabilizability_for_Controllable_Homogeneous_Systems","239064283_Sliding_Order_and_Sliding_Accuracy_in_Sliding_Mode_Control","287571528_Right_hand_side_discontinuous_differential_equations","285028938_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_homogenous_right-hand_sides","284772473_On_pecularities_of_variables_structure_control_systems_with_discontinuous_switching_functions","284491471_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_uniform_homogeneous_right-hand_sides","284389057_The_problem_of_stability_in_a_finite_interval_of_time","284331382_On_stability_of_motion_over_a_finite_interval_of_time","279375353_Sliding_Modes_in_Control_Optimization","279357913_Sliding_Modes_in_Control_and_Optimization","269266684_Semi-Global_Finite-Time_Observers_for_a_Class_of_Non-Lipschitz_Systems","269259102_Robustness_of_Finite-Time_Stability_Property_for_Sliding_Modes","266239430_Unified_Lyapunov_function_for_a_finite-time_stability_analysis_of_relay_second-order_sliding_mode_control_systems","264235292_Lyapunov_Functions_and_Stability_in_Control_Theory","262352430_The_invariance_conditions_in_variable_structure_systems","259118583_Verification_of_ISS_iISS_and_IOSS_properties_applying_weighted_homogeneity","256661035_Robust_Exact_Differentiation_via_Sliding_Mode_Technique","255823960_Sliding_Mode_Control_In_Engineering","255571806_A_view_on_differential_inclusions","253879839_Analysis_of_finite-time_convergence_by_the_method_of_Lyapunov_functions_in_systems_with_second-order_sliding_modes","251919825_Nonsingular_terminal_sliding_mode_control_of_uncertain_two-link_flexible_manipulators","250677663_On_Stability_in_Control_Systems","247920154_The_invariance_conditions_in_variable_structure_systems","246104580_Etude_de_quelques_problemes_de_stabilisation","245218058_Finite-Time_Stabilization_and_Stabilizability_of_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Systems","245217922_Homogeneous_feedback_controls_for_homogeneous_systems","243781702_Homogeneous_coordinates_and_continuous_asymptotically_stabilizing_feedback_controls","243774453_Nilpotent_Approximations_of_Control_Systems_and_Distributions","243766325_Nilpotent_and_High-Order_Approximations_of_Vector_Field_Systems","243111271_Nilpotent_Lie_algebras_of_vectorfields","243093026_Finite_Time_Controllers","241637546_On_settling_time_function_and_stability_of_vector_relay_systems","241173116_Integral_Input-to-output_Stability_for_One_Class_of_Discontinuous_Dynamical_Systems","239331668_Semi-global_finite-time_observers_for_multi-output_nonlinear_systems","229380879_Global_stabilization_of_planar_homogeneous_polynomial_systems","229044095_Nonsingular_terminal_sliding_mode_control_of_a_class_of_nonlinear_dynamical_systems","228572604_Input-to-state_stability_and_interconnections_of_discontinuous_dynamical_systems","226578410_Sliding_Mode_Enforcement_after_1990_Main_Results_and_Some_Open_Problems","226551139_Input_to_State_Stability_and_Allied_System_Properties","226884352_An_Overview_of_Finite-Time_Stability","224801442_Sliding_mode_control_for_gradient_tracking_and_robot_navigation_using_artificial_potential_fields","224627488_Finite_Time_Stability_and_Quasihomogeneous_Control_Synthesis_of_Uncertain_Switched_Systems_with_Application_to_Underactuated_Manipulators"]}
