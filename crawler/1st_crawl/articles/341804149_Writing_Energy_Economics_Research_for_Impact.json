{"id":"341804149_Writing_Energy_Economics_Research_for_Impact","abstract":"We explore the drivers of impact for energy economics research based on an analysis of citations generated by The Energy Journal articles. The focus is on non-topic generators of impact. Our regression analysis shows that these non-topic measures can explain a substantial proportion (about 20%) of variation in future citations. We apply these findings, integrated with prior research on effective economics writing style, to recommend how energy economics articles should be written to increase their impact. These recommendations center particularly around the importance of initial article information provided to the reader and article structure.","authors":["Michael Dowling","Helmi Hammami","Dima Tawil","Ousayna Zreik"],"meta":["June 2020The Energy Journal 42(3):29-43","DOI:10.5547/01956574.42.3.mdow"],"references":["335011086_General-to-specific_Modeling_An_Overview_and_Selected_Bibliography","319626601_The_extent_to_which_the_passive_voice_is_used_in_the_scientific_journal_article_1985-2015","309037605_Generating_Clustered_Journal_Maps_An_Automated_System_for_Hierarchical_Classification","305743915_An_analysis_of_the_titles_of_papers_submitted_to_the_UK_REF_in_2014_authors_disciplines_and_stylistic_details","295569620_General-to-Specific_Modeling_in_Stata","277020509_Readability_Text_and_Context","273504930_What_can_university_administrators_do_to_increase_the_publication_and_citation_scores_of_their_faculty_members","260386219_Pitfalls_of_Using_Citation_Indices_for_Making_Academic_Accounting_Promotion_Tenure_Teaching_Load_and_Merit_Pay_Decisions","259132428_Assessment_evaluations_and_definitions_of_research_impact_A_review","257873796_What_a_difference_a_colon_makes_How_superficial_factors_influence_subsequent_citation","238121809_Citation_Analysis_and_Discourse_Analysis","235605271_The_Impact_of_Article_Length_on_the_Number_of_Future_Citations_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_General_Medicine_Journals","220364700_Article_title_type_and_its_relation_with_the_number_of_downloads_and_citations","328046521_Easy_to_read_easy_to_cite","326906747_Are_killer_bees_good_for_coffee_The_contribution_of_a_paper's_title_and_other_factors_to_its_future_citations","303901877_PDFFigures_20_Mining_Figures_from_Research_Papers","294577114_Factors_affecting_number_of_citations_a_comprehensive_review_of_the_literature","285294518_Improving_a_manuscript's_readability_and_likelihood_of_publication","284579068_National_disciplinary_and_temporal_variations_in_the_extent_to_which_articles_with_more_authors_have_more_impact_Evidence_from_a_geometric_field_normalised_citation_indicator","276054426_Trends_in_Theory_Building_and_Theory_Testing_A_Five-Decade_Study_of_the_Academy_of_Management_Journal","262151624_Deconstructing_the_collaborative_impact_Article_and_author_characteristics_that_influence_citation_count","259095731_Co-authorship_networks_and_research_impact_A_social_capital_perspective","257692380_The_influences_of_counting_methods_on_university_rankings_based_on_paper_count_and_citation_count","240115253_Methodology_Alchemy_or_Science","231998984_The_Perils_of_Paradigm_Mentalities_Revisiting_Kuhn_Lakatos_and_Popper","228840164_A_guide_to_writing_articles_in_energy_science","220066064_Assessing_impact_and_quality_from_local_dynamics_of_citation_networks","7080864_What_determines_the_citation_frequency_of_ecological_papers_Trends_Ecol_Evol"]}
