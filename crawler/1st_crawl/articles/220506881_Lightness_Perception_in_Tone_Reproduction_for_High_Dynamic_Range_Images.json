{"id":"220506881_Lightness_Perception_in_Tone_Reproduction_for_High_Dynamic_Range_Images","abstract":"Abstract An anchoring theory of lightness perception comprehensively explains many characteristics of human visual system such as lightness constancy and its spectacular failures which are important in the perception of images. We present a novel approach to tone mapping of high dynamic range (HDR) images which is inspired by the anchoring theory. The key concept of this method is the decomposition of an HDR image into areas (frameworks) of consistent luminance and the local calculation of the lightness values. The net lightness of an image is calculated via the merging of the frameworks proportionally to their strength. We stress out the importance of relating the luminance to a known brightness value (anchoring) and investigate the advantages of anchoring to the luminance value perceived as white. We validate the accuracy of the lightness reproduction in the presented algorithm by simulating a well known perception experiment. Our approach does not affect the local contrast and preserves the natural colors of an HDR image due to the linear handling of luminance.
