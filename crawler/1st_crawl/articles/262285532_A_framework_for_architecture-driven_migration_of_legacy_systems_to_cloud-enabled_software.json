{"id":"262285532_A_framework_for_architecture-driven_migration_of_legacy_systems_to_cloud-enabled_software","abstract":"With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, an increasing number of organizations view it as an important business strategy to evolve their legacy applications to cloud-enabled infrastructures. We present a framework, named Legacy-to-Cloud Migration Horseshoe, for supporting the migration of legacy systems to cloud computing. The framework leverages the software reengineering concepts that aim to recover the architecture from legacy source code. Then the framework exploits the software evolution concepts to support architecture-driven migration of legacy systems to cloud-based architectures. The Legacy-to-Cloud Migration Horseshoe comprises of four processes: (i) architecture migration planning, (ii) architecture recovery and consistency, (iii) architecture transformation and (iv) architecture-based development of cloud-enabled software. We aim to discover, document and apply the migration process patterns that enhance the reusability of migration processes. We also discuss the required tool support that we intend to provide through our ongoing work in this area.","authors":["Aakash Ahmad","Muhammad Ali Babar"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.1145/2578128.2578232","Conference: Proceedings of the WICSA 2014 Companion Volume"],"references":["301924344_Elasticity_in_cloud_computing_What_it_is_and_what_it_is_not","271589396_Migrating_Service-Oriented_System_to_Cloud_Computing_An_Experience_Report","268292728_Graph-Based_Pattern_Identification_from_Architecture_Change_Logs","261039448_Cloud_modernization_assessment_framework_Analyzing_the_impact_of_a_potential_migration_to_Cloud","260420072_Cloud_Migration_Research_A_Systematic_Review","255569055_Characterizing_Architecturally_Significant_Requirements","252067586_The_CloudMIG_Approach_Model-Based_Migration_of_Software_Systems_to_Cloud-Optimized_Applications","264942137_Elasticity_in_Cloud_Computing_What_it_is_and_What_it_is_Not","263805253_A_REVIEW_OF_DESIGN_PATTERN_MINING_TECHNIQUES","258969590_A_Classification_and_Comparison_Framework_for_Software_Architecture_Description_Languages","234780970_A_tale_of_migration_to_cloud_computing_for_sharing_experiences_and_observations","227260648_Automatic_Generation_of_Executable_Code_from_Software_Architecture_Models","225099943_Style-based_modeling_and_refinement_of_service-oriented_architectures_A_graph_transformation-base_approach","224577627_Static_Architecture-Conformance_Checking_An_Illustrative_Overview","225106306_Laws_of_software_evolution_revisited"]}
