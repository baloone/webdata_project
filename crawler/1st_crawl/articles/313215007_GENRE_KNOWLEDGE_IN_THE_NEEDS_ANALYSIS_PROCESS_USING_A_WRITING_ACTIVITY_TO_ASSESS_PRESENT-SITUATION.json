Our proposal includes a language and a register analysis, in addition to the move analysis proposed by Swales´s theory, in order to suggest a pedagogical methodology to help teachers and course developers develop an English for Academic Purposes course (EAP). Twenty-three abstracts produced by Brazilian Computer Science graduate students are analyzed. The genre knowledge proved to be an appropriate methodological tool for assessing present situation, regarding the current knowledge of the students on the productions of abstracts in English, which revealed a need for a course focused on the social aspect of academic genres.","authors":["Bruna Gabriela Augusto Marçal Vieira"],"meta":["February 2017"],"references":["313214997_O_primeiro_passo_na_trajetoria_da_elaboracao_de_um_curso_de_EAP_para_pos-graduandos_em_Ciencia_da_Computacao_analise_de_necessidades","264493798_Needs_Analysis_and_Curriculum_Development_in_EAP_An_Example_of_a_Critical_Approach","275779388_English_for_Specific_Purposes_A_Learning-Centred_Approach","238750475_Analysing_genre_Language_use_in_professional_settings","235342143_Genre_analysis_English_in_academic_and_research_Settings","222795814_Academic_discourse_and_intellectual_style","222411414_Specificity_Revisited_How_Far_Should_we_Go_Now"]}
