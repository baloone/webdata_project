{"id":"311165534_The_true_effect_of_students'_employment_on_the_duration_of_studies","abstract":"We examine the effect of the first-degree students’ employment on the prolongation of their studies. When employing a popular instrumental variable, the regional unemployment rate, we find a negative impact of students’ employment on duration of studies. Then, adding a predetermined IV – the individual’s employment prior to the beginning of academic studies – turns the estimate positive. Furthermore, we find that the relationship between the extent of students’ employment and duration of their studies depends on their age: among the younger students (aged 22–26), the extent of employment has no effect on the duration of studies, while among the older students, the effect is positive and statistically significant.","authors":["Aviad Tur-Sinai","Dmitri Romanov","Noam Zussman"],"meta":["April 2017Applied Economics 49(33):1-13","DOI:10.1080/00036846.2016.1259749","Project: Tur-Sinai, A., Romanov, D., and Zussman, N.
