{"id":"337195182_Well-posedness_and_nonsmooth_Lyapunov_pairs_for_state-dependent_maximal_monotone_differential_inclusions","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a class of state-dependent maximal\nmonotone differential inclusions. The existence and uniqueness\nof solutions are obtained by using an implicit discretization\nscheme and a kind of hypo-monotonicity assumption.\nIn addition, a characterization for nonsmooth Lyapunov pairs\nassociated with such systems is provided. Our result can be\napplied to study state-dependent sweeping processes and\nLurâ€™e dynamical systems. It is new even the involved maximal\nmonotone operators depend only on the time.","authors":["Ba Khiet Le"],"meta":["November 2019Optimization 69(3)","DOI:10.1080/02331934.2019.1686504"],"references":["338583925_On_a_Class_of_Lur'e_Dynamical_Systems_with_State-Dependent_Set-Valued_Feedback","322562309_Lyapunov_pairs_for_perturbed_sweeping_processes","318623176_Perturbed_Evolution_Problems_with_Continuous_Bounded_Variation_in_Time_and_Applications","307636094_Well-Posedness_and_Output_Regulation_for_Implicit_Time-Varying_Evolution_Variational_Inequalities","329293696_Stochastic_differential_equations_with_reflecting_boundary_condition_in_convex_regions","321506816_Variational_Analysis_and_Generalized_Differentiation_II","317564701_Non-convex_sweeping_processes_involving_maximal_monotone_operators","314001678_Nonlinear_Evolution_Operators_and_Semigroups","313876742_Proximiteet_dualite_dans_un_espace_hilbertien","304121413_Absolute_stability_and_the_Lagrange-Dirichlet_theorem_with_monotone_multivalued_mappings"]}
