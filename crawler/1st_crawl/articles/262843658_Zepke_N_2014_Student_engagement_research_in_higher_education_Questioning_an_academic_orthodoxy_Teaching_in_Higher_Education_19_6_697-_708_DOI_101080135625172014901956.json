It attempts to change this. After briefly outlining a conceptual framework for student engagement, it explores three critical questions about it. First, it asks whether in trying to be all things in teaching and learning, student engagement focuses too much on an engaged generic learner that neglects the impact of specific contexts. Second, it asks whether engagement research, with its focus on identifying engaging classroom practices, has come to emphasise pedagogy at the expense of curriculum, which is a more philosophical and political understanding of purposes, knowledge and values in higher education. It asks, third, whether student engagement has gained its high profile because it aligns with and supports a neoliberal ideology that has an instrumental view of knowledge and emphasises performativity and accountability.","authors":["Nick Zepke"],"meta":["August 2014Teaching in Higher Education Volume 19(5):697-708","DOI:10.1080/13562517.2014.901956"],"references":["263555790_Alienation_agency_and_authenticity_A_synthesis_of_the_literature_on_student_engagement","258124494_Threshold_concepts_and_student_engagement_Revisiting_pedagogical_content_knowledge","254335233_From_curriculum_to_pedagogy_and_back_again_Knowledge_the_person_and_the_changing_world","254228026_Accountability_in_American_education_as_a_rhetoric_and_a_technology_of_governmentality","278664941_Understanding_Student_Engagement_with_a_Contextual_Model","275515315_The_ABCs_of_student_engagement","254335135_Towards_a_complicated_conversation_Teacher_education_and_the_curriculum_turn","254334606_Understanding_teaching_motivation_and_external_influences_in_student_engagement_How_can_complexity_thinking_help","254267763_Addressing_the_wicked_problem_of_quality_in_higher_education_Theoretical_approaches_and_implications","249797781_School_Engagement_Potential_of_the_Concept_State_of_the_Evidence","248991998_Student_Engagement_and_the_Social_Relations_of_Pedagogy","245760089_Concepts_and_Conceptual_Frameworks_Underpinning_the_ETL_Project","241643507_Improving_student_engagement_Ten_proposals_for_action","248912283_The_role_of_engagement_in_inspiring_teaching_and_learning","241801624_Attracting_Engaging_and_Retaining_New_Conversations_about_Learning"]}
