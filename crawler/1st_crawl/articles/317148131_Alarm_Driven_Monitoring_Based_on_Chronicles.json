{"id":"317148131_Alarm_Driven_Monitoring_Based_on_Chronicles","abstract":"Chronicle recognition approaches are challenging techniques for alarm correlation and diagnostic when on-line efficiency is required. They rely on a set of patterns which represents the possible evolutions of the system and constitutes the chronicle base. The main positive point with these approaches is their high efficiency due to the symptom-to-fault knowledge they rely on. The counterpart is the difficulty of acquiring and updating this expertise-based knowledge.","authors":["Marie-odile Cordier","Christophe Dousson"],"meta":["June 2000IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC Papers-OnLine) 33(11):291-296","DOI:10.1016/S1474-6670(17)37375-5"],"references":["312994459_Situation_recognition_Representation_and_algorithms","225405454_Alarm_driven_supervision_for_telecommunication_network_I_-_Off-line_scenarios_generation","221442555_A_Model-Based_Approach_for_Learning_to_Identify_Cardiac_Arrhythmias","285331544_Diagnosis_of_extended_finite_automata_as_a_dynamic_constraint_satisfaction_problem","243775206_Image_understanding_for_visual_surveillance_applications","243575488_Discovering_frequent_episodes_in_event_sequences","234792551_Advances_in_Inductive_Logic_Programming","221048855_A_Constraint-Based_Approach_to_Simulate_Faults_in_Telecommunication_Networks","220837307_Inductive_Learning_of_Chronicles","220812138_Discovering_Chronicles_with_Numerical_Time_Constraints_from_Alarm_Logs_for_Monitoring_Dynamic_Systems","220430671_On_Communicating_Finite-State_Machines","5596175_An_approach_by_graphs_for_the_recognition_of_temporal_scenarios","3406517_TIGER_Real-time_situation_assessment_of_dynamic_systems"]}
