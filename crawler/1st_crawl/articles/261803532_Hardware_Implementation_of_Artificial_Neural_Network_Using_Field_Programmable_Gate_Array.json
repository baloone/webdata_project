{"id":"261803532_Hardware_Implementation_of_Artificial_Neural_Network_Using_Field_Programmable_Gate_Array","abstract":"In this paper a hardware implementation of an artificial neural network on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) is presented. A digital system architecture is designed to realize a feed forward multilayer neural network. The designed architecture is described using Very High Speed Integrated Circuits Hardware Description Language (VHDL). The parallel structure of a neural network makes it potentially fast for the computation of certain tasks. The same feature makes a neural network well suited for implementation in VLSI technology. Hardware realization of a Neural Network (NN), to a large extent depends on the efficient implementation of a single neuron. FPGA-based reconfigurable computing architectures are suitable for hardware implementation of neural networks. FPGA realization of ANNs with a large number of neurons is still a challenging task.","authors":["Esraa Zeki Mohammed"],"meta":["January 2013International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering 5(5)","DOI:10.7763/IJCTE.2013.V5.795"],"references":["316805765_Rapid_Prototyping_of_Digital_Systems","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","285332282_VGA_Video_Display_Generation_using_FPGAs","242759526_HARDWARE_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_A_FEEDFORWARD_NEURAL_NETWORK_USING_FPGAs","242600969_Neural_Network_Implementation_Using_FPGA_Issues_and_Application","221218355_Design_of_Neural_Network_on_FPGA","220422075_Neural_Networks_Applications_in_Industry_Business_and_Science","3351622_Efficient_digital_implementation_of_the_sigmoid_function_for_reprogrammable_logic"]}
