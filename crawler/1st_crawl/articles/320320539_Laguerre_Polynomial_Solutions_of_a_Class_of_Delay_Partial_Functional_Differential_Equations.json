{"id":"320320539_Laguerre_Polynomial_Solutions_of_a_Class_of_Delay_Partial_Functional_Differential_Equations","abstract":"In this study, we develop a novel matrix collocation method based on the Laguerre polynomials to find the approximate solutions of some parabolic delay differential equations with integral terms subject to appropriate initial and boundary conditions. The method reduces the solution of the mentioned equations to the solution of a matrix equation which corresponds to system of algebraic equations with unknown Laguerre coefficients. Besides, the error analysis together with numerical results are performed to illustrate the efficiency of our method computationally.\n\nDOI: 10.12693/APhysPolA.132.558\n\nPACS/topics: Laguerre polynomials and series, delay partial differential equations with integral terms, matrix and collocation methods, error estimations","authors":["B.
