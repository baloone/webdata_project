{"id":"281671006_A_unified_heuristic_and_an_annotated_bibliography_for_a_large_class_of_earliness-tardiness_scheduling_problems","abstract":"This work proposes a unified heuristic algorithm for a large class of\nearliness-tardiness (E-T) scheduling problems. We consider single/parallel\nmachine E-T problems that may or may not consider some additional features such\nas idle time, setup times and release dates. In addition, we also consider\nthose problems whose objective is to minimize either the total (average)\nweighted completion time or the total (average) weighted flow time, which arise\nas particular cases when the due dates of all jobs are either set to zero or to\ntheir associated release dates, respectively. The developed local search based\nmetaheuristic framework is quite simple, but at the same time relies on\nsophisticated procedures for efficiently performing local search according to\nthe characteristics of the problem. We present efficient move evaluation\napproaches for some parallel machine problems that generalize the existing ones\nfor single machine problems. The algorithm was tested in hundreds of instances\nof several E-T problems and particular cases. The results obtained show that\nour unified heuristic is capable of producing high quality solutions when\ncompared to the best ones available in the literature that were obtained by\nspecific methods. Moreover, we provide an extensive annotated bibliography on\nthe problems related to those considered in this work, where we not only\nindicate the approach(es) used in each publication, but we also point out the\ncharacteristics of the problem(s) considered. Beyond that, we classify the\nexisting methods in different categories so as to have a better idea of the\npopularity of each type of solution procedure.","authors":["Arthur Kramer","Anand Subramanian"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Scheduling 22(1):21-57","DOI:10.1007/s10951-017-0549-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304344789_An_exact_extended_formulation_for_the_unrelated_parallel_machine_total_weighted_completion_time_problem","287219443_Solution_heuristic_approaches_for_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_VRP","280715660_Hybrid_GRASP_Heuristics_to_Solve_an_Unrelated_Parallel_Machine_Scheduling_Problem_with_Earliness_and_Tardiness_Penalties","278717601_Scheduling_Unrelated_Parallel_Machines_with_Sequence_Dependent_Setup_Times_and_Weighted_Earliness-Tardiness_Minimization","311894498_Variable_Neighborhood_Search","309573949_Lower_bounds_for_parallel_machine_scheduling_problems","285310735_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Single-Machine_Earliness-Tardiness_Scheduling_Problem","281128473_Exponential_neighborhood_search_for_a_parallel_machine_scheduling_problem","281060530_Metaheuristic_Approaches_for_Vehicle_Routing_Problems","277690847_Mathematical_Programming_and_Heuristics_for_Scheduling_Problems_with_Early_and_Tardy_Penalties"]}
