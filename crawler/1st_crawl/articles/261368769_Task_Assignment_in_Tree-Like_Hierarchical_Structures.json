{"id":"261368769_Task_Assignment_in_Tree-Like_Hierarchical_Structures","abstract":"Most large organizations, such as corporations, are hierarchical\norganizations. In hierarchical organizations each entity in the organization,\nexcept the root entity, is a sub-part of another entity. In this paper we study\nthe task assignment problem to the entities of tree-like hierarchical\norganizations. The inherent tree structure introduces an interesting and\nchallenging constraint to the standard assignment problem. When a task is\nassigned to an entity in a hierarchical organization, the whole entity,\nincluding its sub-entities, is responsible from the execution of that\nparticular task. In other words, if an entity has been assigned to a task,\nneither its descendants nor its ancestors can be assigned to a task.\nSub-entities cannot be assigned as they have an ancestor already occupied.\nAncestor entities cannot be assigned since one of their sub-entities has\nalready been employed in an assignment. In the paper, we formally introduce\nthis new version of the assignment problem called Maximum Weight Tree Matching\n($MWTM$), and show its NP-hardness. We also propose an effective heuristic\nsolution based on an iterative LP-relaxation to it.","authors":["Cem Evrendilek","Ismail Toroslu","Sasan Hashemi"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 34(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-016-0097-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228057795_A_New_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_Linear_Programming-II","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","276526934_A_New_Semidefinite_Programming_Relaxation_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem_and_Its_Computational_Perspectives","274294869_A_Logarithmic_Method_for_Reducing_Binary_Variables_and_Inequality_Constraints_in_Solving_Task_Assignment_Problems","270504740_Resource-Constrained_Assignment_Problems_with_Shared_Resource_Consumption_and_Flexible_Demand","259602606_Integer_programming_models_for_the_multidimensional_assignment_problem_with_star_costs","257153743_Group-to-group_reviewer_assignment_problem","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","222408361_Multiple_task_assignments_for_cooperating_uninhabited_aerial_vehicles_using_genetic_algorithms","220669075_Branch_and_Price_for_Large-Scale_Capacitated_Hub_Location_Problems_with_Single_Assignment","220779129_Tight_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_General_Assignment_Problems","220693673_Assignment_Problems","220313381_A_dynamic_programming_algorithm_for_tree-like_weighted_set_packing_problem","220199844_A_genetic_algorithm_for_maximum-weighted_tree_matching_problem"]}
