{"id":"338174486_The_use_of_eye_tracking_technology_to_explore_learning_and_performance_within_virtual_reality_and_mixed_reality_settings_a_scoping_review","abstract":"This scoping review examines studies using eye tracking technology to monitor learning and performance in virtual or mixed reality settings. The aim of this review is to describe the various ways in which eye tracking devices have been deployed in relation to key aspects of virtual reality and mixed reality environments, list the eye tracking measures most salient to such environments and identify emergent patterns in the findings that the eye tracking data in the studies reviewed have brought to light. Drawing on these findings, an analytical framework for attending to and analysing eye tracking data is proposed and recommendations for future research using eye tracking to optimise learning and performance within virtual reality and mixed reality environments are discussed.","authors":["Natasha Anne Rappa","Susan Ledger","Timothy Teo","Kok Wai Wong"],"meta":["December 2019Interactive Learning Environments","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2019.1702560"],"references":["286244335_Evaluating_the_usefulness_of_Eye_Tracking_in_Game-based_Learning","332200751_Using_the_Experience_of_Evoked_Emotion_in_Virtual_Reality_to_Manage_Workplace_Stress_Affective_Control_Theory_ACT","323689946_Multi-player_online_simulated_driving_game_to_improve_hazard_perception","323249284_Effects_of_Mixed-Reality_on_Players'_Behaviour_and_Immersion_in_a_Cultural_Tourism_Game_A_Cognitive_Processing_Perspective","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","307813733_Cognitive_Issues_in_Virtual_Reality","304259712_Virtual_reality_What_is_the_state_of_play_in_education","302025670_Visual_Attention","290483874_Eye_tracking_eye-based_human-computer_interaction","275999586_3D_Virtual_Worlds"]}
