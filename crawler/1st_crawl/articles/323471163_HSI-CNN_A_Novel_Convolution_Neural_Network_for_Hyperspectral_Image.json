{"id":"323471163_HSI-CNN_A_Novel_Convolution_Neural_Network_for_Hyperspectral_Image","abstract":"With the development of deep learning, the performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has been greatly improved in recent years. The shortage of training samples has become a bottleneck for further improvement of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network framework for the characteristics of hyperspectral image data, called HSI-CNN. Firstly, the spectral-spatial feature is extracted from a target pixel and its neighbors. Then, a number of one-dimensional feature maps, obtained by convolution operation on spectral-spatial features, are stacked into a two-dimensional matrix. Finally, the two-dimensional matrix considered as an image is fed into standard CNN. This is why we call it HSI-CNN. In addition, we also implements two depth network classification models, called HSI-CNN+XGBoost and HSI-CapsNet, in order to compare the performance of our framework. Experiments show that the performance of hyperspectral image classification is improved efficiently with HSI-CNN framework. We evaluate the model's performance using four popular HSI datasets, which are the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University scene (PU) and Salinas scene (SA). As far as we concerned, HSI-CNN has got the state-of-art accuracy among all methods we have known on these datasets of 99.28%, 99.09%, 99.42%, 98.95% separately.","authors":["Yanan Luo","Jie Zou","Chengfei Yao","Tao Li"],"meta":["February 2018"],"references":["282478197_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","264564342_Deep_Learning-Based_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Data","260623238_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_via_Kernel_Sparse_Representation","224236796_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_Using_Dictionary-Based_Sparse_Representation","224113805_Semisupervised_Neural_Networks_for_Efficient_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","43288590_Ash_decline_assessment_in_emerald_ash_borer-infested_regions_A_test_of_tree-level_hyperspectral_technologies","41908051_Spatial_mapping_of_leaf_area_index_using_hyperspectral_remote_sensing_for_hydrological_applications_with_a_particular_focus_on_canopy_interception","3203723_Investigation_of_the_random_forest_framework_for_classification_of_hyperspectral_data","3203556_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Images_with_Support_Vector_Machines","3203189_Hyperion_a_Space-Based_Imaging_Spectrometer","321745331_Capsule_Network_Performance_on_Complex_Data","320627198_Dynamic_Routing_Between_Capsules","315505906_Robust_patch-based_sparse_representation_for_hyperspectral_image_classification","312527255_Spectral-spatial_classification_of_hyperspectral_imagery_using_a_dual-channel_convolutional_neural_network","312485644_Cube-CNN-SVM_A_Novel_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_Method","312355586_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Imagery_with_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Network","308293598_Convolutional_neural_networks_for_hyperspectral_image_classification","301839264_XGBoost_A_Scalable_Tree_Boosting_System","274801291_Image_Analysis_Using_Mathematical_Morphology","271828281_Image_Analysis_and_Mathematical_Morphology_Vol_1","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","254059719_Spatial-Spectral_Preprocessing_Prior_to_Endmember_Identification_and_Unmixing_of_Remotely_Sensed_Hyperspectral_Data","241378949_Review_Article_Hyperspectral_geological_remote_sensing_evaluation_of_analytical_techniques","237546983_Using_vegetation_reflectance_variability_for_species_level_classification_of_hyperspectral_data","224169358_Local_Manifold_Learning-Based_-Nearest-Neighbor_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","223458752_Automated_registration_of_hyperspectral_images_for_precision_agriculture","220601731_A_novel_hybrid_CNN-SVM_classifier_for_recognizing_handwritten_digits","3321401_Hyperspectral_image_data_analysis"]}
