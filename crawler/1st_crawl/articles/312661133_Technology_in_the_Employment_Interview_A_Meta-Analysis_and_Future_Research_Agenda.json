{"id":"312661133_Technology_in_the_Employment_Interview_A_Meta-Analysis_and_Future_Research_Agenda","abstract":"The use of technology such as telephone and video has become common when conducting employment interviews. However, little is known about how technology affects applicant reactions and interviewer ratings. We conducted meta-analyses of 12 studies that resulted in K = 13 unique samples and N = 1,557. Mean effect sizes for interview medium on ratings (d = -.41) and reactions (d = -.36) were moderate and negative, suggesting that interviewer ratings and applicant reactions are lower in technology-mediated interviews. Generalizing research findings from face-to-face interviews to technology mediated interviews is inappropriate. Organizations should be especially wary of varying interview mode across applicants, as inconsistency in administration could lead to fairness issues. At the same time, given the limited research that exists, we call for renewed attention and further studies on potential moderators of this effect.","authors":["Nikki Blacksmith","Jon Willford","Tara S Behrend"],"meta":["January 2016Personnel Assessment and Decisions 2(1):12-20","DOI:10.25035/pad.2016.002","Project: Technology and Job Interviews"],"references":["280949864_Observable_attributes_as_manifestations_and_cues_of_personality_and_intelligence","275581711_Behavioral_Expression_of_Job_Interview_Anxiety","298100679_The_use_of_impression_management_tactics_in_structured_interviews_A_function_of_question_type","297087477_MIXED-MODE_DATA-COLLECTION_-_TELEPHONE_AND_PERSONAL_INTERVIEWING","288166299_Selecting_and_developing_members_for_the_organization","285900762_Applicant_Reactions_to_Technology-Based_Selection_What_We_Know_So_Far","281673781_Combining_I-O_psychology_and_technology_for_an_environmentally_sustainable_world","280654502_Impression_Management_A_Literature_Review_and_Two-Component_Model","280022721_Making_the_Right_Impression_A_Field_Study_of_Applicant_Impression_Management_During_Job_Interviews","279326500_Understanding_Social_Systems"]}
