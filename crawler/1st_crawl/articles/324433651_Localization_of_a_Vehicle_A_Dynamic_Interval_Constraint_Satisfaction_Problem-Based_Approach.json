{"id":"324433651_Localization_of_a_Vehicle_A_Dynamic_Interval_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problem-Based_Approach","abstract":"This paper introduces a new interval constraint propagation (ICP) approach dealing with the real-time vehicle localization problem. Bayesian methods like extended Kalman filter (EKF) are classically used to achieve vehicle localization. ICP is an alternative which provides guaranteed localization results rather than probabilities. Our approach assumes that all models and measurement errors are bounded within known limits without any other hypotheses on the probability distribution. The proposed algorithm uses a low-level consistency algorithm and has been validated with an outdoor vehicle equipped with a GPS receiver, a gyro, and odometers. Results have been compared to EKF and other ICP methods such as hull consistency (HC4) and 3-bound (3B) algorithms. Both consistencies of EKF and our algorithm have been experimentally studied.","authors":["Kangni Kueviakoe","Zhan Wang","Alain Lambert","Emmanuelle Frenoux"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Sensors 2018(1):1-12","DOI:10.1155/2018/3769058","Project: Guaranteed Localization and Mapping for Autonomous Vehicles"],"references":["276044103_Comparison_of_Interval_Constraint_Propagation_Algorithms_for_Vehicle_Localization","264812687_Experimental_comparison_of_Bayesian_positioning_methods_based_on_multi-sensor_data_fusion","317967474_A_multihypothesis_set_approach_for_mobile_robot_localization_using_heterogeneous_measurements_provided_by_the_Internet_of_Things","309282397_Cooperative_Localization_with_Reliable_Confidence_Domains_Between_Vehicles_Sharing_GNSS_Pseudoranges_Errors_with_No_Base_Station","305848318_A_minimal_contractor_for_the_polar_equation_Application_to_robot_localization","282372632_LOGICAL_ARITHMETIC","277672023_Algorithm_852","269332187_A_real-time_interval_constraint_propagation_method_for_vehicle_localization","269191210_Inner_and_Outer_Approximations_of_Probabilistic_Sets","265580293_IBEX_-an_Interval-Based_EXplorer"]}
