{"id":"226532243_A_Fuzzy_Vault_scheme","abstract":"We describe a simple and novel cryptographic construction that we refer to as a fuzzy vault. A player Alice may place a secret value κ in a fuzzy vault and “lock” it using a set A of elements from some public universe U. If Bob tries to “unlock” the vault using a set B of similar length, he obtains κ only if B is close to A, i.e., only if A and B overlap substantially. In constrast to previous constructions of this flavor, ours possesses the useful feature of order invariance, meaning that the ordering of A and B is immaterial to the functioning of the vault. As we show, our scheme enjoys provable security against a computationally\nunbounded attacker. Fuzzy vaults have potential application to the problem of protecting data in a number of real-world, error-prone\nenvironments. These include systems in which personal information serves to authenticate users for, e.g., the purposes of\npassword recovery, and also to biometric authentication systems, in which readings are inherently noisy as a result of the\nrefractory nature of image capture and processing.","authors":["Ari Juels","Madhu Sudan"],"meta":["February 2006Designs Codes and Cryptography 38(2):237-257","DOI:10.1007/s10623-005-6343-z","SourceDBLP"],"references":["304134579_Hardness_of_approximating_the_minimum_distance_of_a_linear_code","285347664_Efficient_cryptographic_protocols_based_on_noisy_channels","243764349_Practical_quantum_oblivious_transfer_protocols","224066998_Hardness_of_approximating_the_minimum_distance_of_a_linear_code","221609838_Error-tolerant_password_recovery","221354844_Proving_Without_Knowing_On_Oblivious_Agnostic_and_Blindolded_Provers","221354779_Practical_Quantum_Oblivious_Transfer","221348115_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","3785000_Improved_decoding_of_Reed-Solomon_and_algebraic-geometric_codes","3498806_Achieving_oblivious_transfer_using_weakened_security_assumptions","3084600_Hardness_of_Approximating_the_Minimum_Distance_of_a_Linear_Code","2635390_Provably_Secure_Password-Authenticated_Key_Exchange_Using_Diffie-Hellman","2577452_A_Fuzzy_Commitment_Scheme","2335908_Cryptanalysis_of_Block_Ciphers_with_Probabilistic_Non-Linear_Relations_of_Low_Degree","2269101_Proving_Without_Knowing_On_Oblivious_Agnostic_and_Blindfolded_Provers","271645055_Evaluating_Biometric_Encryption_Key_Generation","265352688_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","247464653_Secure_private_key_generation_using_a_fingerprint","238360372_Topics_in_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","230344314_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","228830228_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Graphical_Passwords","226577502_Non-Interactive_and_Information-Theoretic_Secure_Verifiable_Secret_Sharing","223831757_Protecting_secret_keys_with_personal_entropy","221355569_Cryptanalysis_of_Block_Ciphers_with_Probabilistic_Non-linear_Relations_of_Low_Degree","221348411_How_to_Share_a_Secret","221348035_Noisy_Polynomial_Interpolation_and_Noisy_Chinese_Remaindering","221326742_A_Digital_Signature_Scheme_Based_on_Linear_Error-correcting_Block_Codes","220713537_On_Enabling_Secure_Applications_Through_Off-Line_Biometric_Identification","220425267_How_to_Share_a_Secret","220066923_Password_hardening_based_on_keystroke_dynamics","23608386_A_Public-Key_Cryptosystem_Based_on_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","3489163_Encoding_and_Error-Correction_Procedures_for_the_Bose-Chaudhuri_Codes","3081461_Shift-Register_Synthesis_and_BCH_Decoding","2878986_A_Fair_and_Efficient_Solution_to_the_Socialist_Millionaires'_Problem","2630685_Experimental_Quantum_Cryptography","2552511_A_New_Identification_Scheme_Based_on_Syndrome_Decoding","2457081_On_the_Relation_of_Error_Correction_and_Cryptography_to_an_Off_Line_Biometric_Based_Identification_Scheme"]}
