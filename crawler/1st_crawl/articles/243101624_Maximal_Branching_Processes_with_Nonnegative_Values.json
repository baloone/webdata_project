{"id":"243101624_Maximal_Branching_Processes_with_Nonnegative_Values","abstract":"A generalization of the maximal branching processes introduced by Lamperti from the domain Z+ to R+ is proved. Some properties of these processes are investigated, an ergodic theorem is proved, and examples are given. Applications of the maximal branching processes to the queueing theory are given.","authors":["Alexey V.
