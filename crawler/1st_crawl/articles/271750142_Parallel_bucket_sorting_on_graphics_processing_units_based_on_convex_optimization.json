{"id":"271750142_Parallel_bucket_sorting_on_graphics_processing_units_based_on_convex_optimization","abstract":"We found an interesting relation between convex optimization and sorting problem. We present a parallel algorithm to compute multiple order statistics of the data by minimizing a number of related convex functions. The computed order statistics serve as splitters that group the data into buckets suitable for parallel bitonic sorting. This led us to a parallel bucket sort algorithm, which we implemented for many-core architecture of graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed sorting method is competitive to the state-of-the-art GPU sorting algorithms and is superior to most of them for long sorting keys.","authors":["Gleb Beliakov","Gang Li","Shaowu Liu"],"meta":["December 2013Optimization 64(4):1-23","DOI:10.1080/02331934.2013.836645"],"references":["263596071_Derivative-free_optimization_and_neural_networks_for_robust_regression","224140666_High_Performance_Comparison-Based_Sorting_Algorithm_on_Many-Core_GPUs","221214289_GPUTeraSort_High_Performance_Graphics_Coprocessor_Sorting_for_Large_Database_Management","220951290_Designing_efficient_sorting_algorithms_for_manycore_GPUs","313645165_Scan_primitives_for_GPU_computing","268863379_Order_Statistics","268308412_The_art_of_computer_programming_Vol_2_chapter_4","258696233_Aggregation_functions_based_on_penalties","257015019_Improving_the_speed_and_stability_of_the_k-nearest_neighbors_method","256651264_Numerical_Recipes_The_art_of_scientific_computing","250893210_Understanding_the_median_as_a_fusion_operator","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","246355633_Handbook_Of_Means_And_Their_Inequalities","244955309_A_First_Course_in_Order_Statistics","243095679_On_Shape_Preserving_Quadratic_Spline_Interpolation","239579195_Optimization_and_Nonsmooth_Analysis","238871050_Note_on_the_Median_of_a_Set_of_Numbers","236413483_Parallel_sorting_algorithms","236247939_Computing_of_high_breakdown_regression_estimators_without_sorting_on_graphics_processing_units","230873058_The_Cutting-Plane_Method_for_Solving_Convex_Programs","227450954_Fast_Computation_of_Trimmed_Means","224140665_GPU_sample_sort","222646437_Aggregation_functions_based_on_penalties","222516632_Fast_Parallel_GPU-sorting_using_a_Hybrid_Algorithm","222219413_Time_Bounds_for_Selection","220639794_GPU-Quicksort_A_practical_Quicksort_algorithm_for_graphics_processors","220440139_High_Performance_and_Scalable_Radix_Sorting_a_Case_Study_of_Implementing_Dynamic_Parallelism_for_GPU_Computing","220104625_Fast_in-place_comparison-based_sorting_with_CUDA_A_study_with_bitonic_sort","216457274_The_Art_Of_Computer_Programming_Vol3_Sorting_and_Searching","202260509_Scan_Primitives_for_GPU_Computing","51887748_Parallel_calculation_of_the_median_and_order_statistics_on_GPUs_withapplication_to_robust_regression","45902803_Deterministic_sample_sort_for_GPUs","3336191_Quantitative_Weights_and_Aggregation"]}
