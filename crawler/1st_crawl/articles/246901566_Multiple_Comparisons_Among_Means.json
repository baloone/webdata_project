{"id":"246901566_Multiple_Comparisons_Among_Means","abstract":"Methods for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for all possible linear contrasts among several means of normally distributed variables have been given by Scheff√© and Tukey. In this paper the possibility is considered of picking in advance a number (say m) of linear contrasts among k means, and then estimating these m linear contrasts by confidence intervals based on a Student t statistic, in such a way that the overall confidence level for the m intervals is greater than or equal to a preassigned value. It is found that for some values of k, and for m not too large, intervals obtained in this way are shorter than those using the F distribution or the Studentized range. When this is so, the experimenter may be willing to select the linear combinations in advance which he wishes to estimate in order to have m shorter intervals instead of an infinite number of longer intervals.","authors":["Olive Jean Dunn"],"meta":["March 1961Journal of the American Statistical Association 56(293):52-64","DOI:10.1080/01621459.1961.10482090"],"references":["242393808_A_Problem_of_Multiple_Comparisons","38367295_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Ratio_of_the_ith_Observation_in_an_Ordered_Sample_from_a_Normal_Population_to_an_Independent_Estimate_of_the_Standard_Deviation","38366808_Estimation_of_the_Means_of_Dependent_Variables","30967880_A_Method_for_Judging_All_Contrests_in_the_Analysis_of_Variance"]}
