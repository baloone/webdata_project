{"id":"284186632_An_Experiment_to_Measure_the_Cognitive_Weights_of_Code_Control_Structures","abstract":"Various measures of software complexity have been proposed over the\nyears. More recently, cognitive complexity measures of software have been\nproposed as a complement to other more widely adopted measures that\nare primarily based on physical size and/or a systematic analysis of code.\nMany of these cognitive measures consider the notion of cognitive weight to\nbe an integral part of code comprehension and complexity. Previous work\nhas proposed experiments to derive cognitive weight values for code control\nstructures. Unfortunately, there are a number of flaws in these experiments.\nThese flaws in previous worksâ€™ experiments need to be addressed by a new\nexperiment if reasonable cognitive weight values for code control structures\nare to be derived. The experimental design and tool presented in this paper\nattempt to address some of the problems in previous experiments. Cognitive\nweight values for code control structures are derived using data gathered\nfrom our experiments and are then compared with cognitive weight values\nfrom previous works.","authors":["David Adamo"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.1.2877.8960"],"references":["4278385_On_Experiments_for_Measuring_Cognitive_Weights_for_Software_Control_Structures","4278379_Cognitive_Program_Complexity_Measure","309207034_Object-Oriented_Metrics_A_Review_of_Theory_and_Practice","242389416_The_profile_metric_a_complexity_metric_to_improve_software_quality","235978157_Elements_Of_Software_Science","234791827_Third_time_charm_Stronger_prediction_of_programmer_performance_by_software_complexity_metrics","221554569_Third_Time_Charm_Stronger_Replication_of_the_Ability_of_Software_Complexity_Metrics_to_Predict_Programmer_Performance","220882609_Evaluating_Cognitive_Information_Complexity_Measure","220631767_A_modified_cognitive_information_complexity_measure_of_software","4248300_Cognitive_Complexity_of_Software_and_its_Measurement"]}
