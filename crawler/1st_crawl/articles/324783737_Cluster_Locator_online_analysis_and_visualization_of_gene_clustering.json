{"id":"324783737_Cluster_Locator_online_analysis_and_visualization_of_gene_clustering","abstract":"Genes sharing functions, expression patterns or quantitative traits are not randomly distributed along eukaryotic genomes. In order to study the distribution of genes that share a given feature, we present Cluster Locator, an online analysis and visualization tool. Cluster Locator determines the number, size and position of all the clusters formed by the protein-coding genes on a list according to a given maximum gap, the percentage of gene clustering of the list and its statistical significance. The output includes a visual representation of the distribution of genes and gene clusters along the reference genome.\n\nAvailability: \nCluster Locator is freely available at http://clusterlocator.bnd.edu.uy/.\n\nContact: \nfpazos@iibce.edu.uy.\n\nSupplementary information: \nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Flavio Pazos Obreg√≥n","Pablo Soto","Jose Luis Lavin Trueba","Ana Rosa Cortazar"],"meta":["April 2018Bioinformatics 34(19)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty336","Projects: Spalt genesGene function prediction through machine learning"],"references":["316247725_Clustering_of_Drosophila_housekeeping_promoters_facilitates_their_expression","313495281_Genome-wide_identification_of_physically_clustered_genes_suggests_chromatin-level_co-regulation_in_male_reproductive_development_in_Arabidopsis_thaliana","273147354_Neighboring_Genes_Show_Correlated_Evolution_in_Gene_Expression","264202141_Functional_gene_groups_are_concentrated_within_chromosomes_among_chromosomes_and_in_the_nuclear_space_of_the_human_genome","245027085_CluGene_A_Bioinformatics_Framework_for_the_Identification_of_Co-Localized_Co-Expressed_and_Co-Regulated_Genes_Aimed_at_the_Investigation_of_Transcriptional_Regulatory_Networks_from_High-Throughput_Exp","234160070_Kerfuffle_A_web_tool_for_multi-species_gene_colocalization_analysis","11173821_Chromosomal_clustering_of_muscle-expressed_genes_in_Caenorhabditis_elegans","8573415_The_evolutionary_dynamics_of_eukaryotic_gene_order","7517613_Genomic_Gene_Clustering_Analysis_of_Pathways_in_Eukaryotes","6566099_Identifying_clusters_of_functionally_related_genes_in_genomes","285028466_Cluster_analysis_and_display_of_genome-wide_expression_patterns","280968418_Why_the_activity_of_a_gene_depends_on_its_neighbors","263707810_Clustering_Of_gene_ontology_terms_in_genomes","44621877_Genomic_neighbourhood_and_the_regulation_of_gene_expression","5767007_Coexpression_coregulation_and_cofunctionality_of_neighboring_genes_in_eukaryotic_genomes"]}
