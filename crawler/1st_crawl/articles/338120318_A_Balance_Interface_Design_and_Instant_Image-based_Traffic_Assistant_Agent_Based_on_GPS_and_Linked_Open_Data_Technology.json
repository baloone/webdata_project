{"id":"338120318_A_Balance_Interface_Design_and_Instant_Image-based_Traffic_Assistant_Agent_Based_on_GPS_and_Linked_Open_Data_Technology","abstract":"Taiwan is a highly informational country, and a robust traffic network is not only critical to the national economy, but is also an important infrastructure for economic development. This paper aims to integrate government open data and global positioning system (GPS) technology to build an instant image-based traffic assistant agent with user-friendly interfaces, thus providing more convenient real-time traffic information for users and relevant government units. The proposed system is expected to overcome the difficulty of accurately distinguishing traffic information and to solve the problem of some road sections not providing instant information. Taking the New Taipei City Government traffic open data as an example, the proposed system can display information pages at an optimal size on smartphones and other computer devices, and integrate database analysis to instantly view traffic information. Users can enter the system without downloading the application and can access the cross-platform services using device browsers. The proposed system also provides a user reporting mechanism, which informs vehicle drivers on congested road sections about road conditions. Comparison and analysis of the system with similar applications shows that although they have similar functions, the proposed system offers more practicability, better information accessibility, excellent user experience, and approximately the optimal balance (a kind of symmetry) of the important items of the interface design.","authors":["Fu-Hsien Chen","Sheng-Yuan Yang"],"meta":["December 2019Symmetry 12(1):1","DOI:10.3390/sym12010001"],"references":["337044244_Urban_Transportation_System_Resilience_and_Diversity_Coupling_using_Large-scale_Taxicab_GPS_Data","336888131_Location_Based_Services_with_Location_Centric_Profiles","325292726_Linked_Open_Data_as_Universal_Markers_for_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Applications_in_Cultural_Heritage","325242393_Open_data_and_databases_in_analysis_of_traffic_accidents_in_Belgrade","333737245_Cross-Domain_Recommendation_for_Enhancing_Cultural_Heritage_Experience","327998372_Accessibility_based_on_Gravity-Radiation_model_and_Google_Maps_API_A_case_study_in_Australia","326840081_Social_event_detection-A_systematic_approach_using_ontology_and_linked_open_data_with_significance_to_semantic_links","326054684_Cloud_Data_Design_Orchestration_and_Management_Using_Microsoft_Azure","326052391_Azure_Data_Lake_Store_and_Azure_Data_Lake_Analytics","312636480_Semantic_Enrichment_for_Local_Search_Engine_using_Linked_Open_Data"]}
