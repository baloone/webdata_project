{"id":"282990841_Cyclic_codes_and_algebraic_immunity_of_Boolean_functions","abstract":"Since 2003, algebraic attacks have received a lot of attention in the cryptography literature. In this context, algebraic immunity quantifies the resistance of a Boolean function to the standard algebraic attack of the pseudo-random generators using it as a nonlinear Boolean function. A high value of algebraic immunity is now an absolutely necessary cryptographic criterion for a resistance to algebraic attacks but is not sufficient, because of more general kinds of attacks so-called Fast Algebraic Attacks. In view of these attacks, the study of the set of annihilators of a Boolean function has become very important. We show that studying the annihilators of a Boolean function can be translated into studying the codewords of a linear code. We then explain how to exploit that connection to evaluate or estimate the algebraic immunity of a cryptographic function. Direct links between the theory of annihilators used in algebraic attacks and coding theory are established using an atypical univariate approach.","authors":["Sihem Mesnager","Gerard Cohen"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/ITW.2015.7133110"],"references":["304309752_Notion_of_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Its_evaluation_Related_to_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","224249283_Fast_Discrete_Fourier_Spectra_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers","224227942_Simplifying_algebraic_attacks_with_univariate_analysis","221348381_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Boolean_Functions","221348082_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers_with_Linear_Feedback","221327270_An_Infinite_Class_of_Balanced_Functions_with_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_Good_Immunity_to_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Good_Nonlinearity","220833868_On_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Annihilators","2524752_Higher_Order_Correlation_Attacks_XL_Algorithm_and_Cryptanalysis_of_Toyocrypt","291140956_Higher_order_correlation_attacks_XL_algorithm_and_crypt_analysis_of_toyocrypt","266282029_Generalizations_of_the_BCH_bound","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","236935853_A_remark_on_algebraic_immunity_of_Boolean_functions","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes","3081730_On_the_Minimum_Distance_of_Certain_Reversible_Cyclic_Codes"]}
