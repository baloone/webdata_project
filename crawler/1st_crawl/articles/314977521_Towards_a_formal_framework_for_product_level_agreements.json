{"id":"314977521_Towards_a_formal_framework_for_product_level_agreements","abstract":"In the European project IMAGINE we address the problem of cross-organizational processes interoperability in dynamic collaboration environments for product detailed design. By dynamicity we mean that partners can quit the collaboration and be replaced by other partners at run-time. We rst propose to capture the objective of the collaboration that is reaching agreements between the involved partners on the configurations of the nal product components. Successfully capturing agreements contributes to minimizing the coupling between partners which reduces the impact of changes in the collaboration environment. Then, from the speci cation of agreements, we generate the cross-organizational process that automates message exchanges between partners. Nevertheless, the fragments of this cross-organizational process can face interoperability issues during run-time. This issue arises because each process fragment belonging to a partner should be generated while upholding business rules of this partner.\nAccordingly, we propose an automatic mediation approach that is well-adapted for dynamic collaboration environments. We present the implementation and the evaluation of our framework and an industrial case study is followed to illustrate how our framework can be used in practice.","authors":["Malik Khalfallah","Nicolas Figay","Mahmoud Barhamgi","P.
