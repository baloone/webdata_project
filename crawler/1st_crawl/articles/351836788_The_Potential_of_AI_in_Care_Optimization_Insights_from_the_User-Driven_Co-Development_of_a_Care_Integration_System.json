{"id":"351836788_The_Potential_of_AI_in_Care_Optimization_Insights_from_the_User-Driven_Co-Development_of_a_Care_Integration_System","abstract":"Transitions from one level of care to another are complex processes that pose medical and organizational risks and depend on care integration between different providers. This qualitative study investigated user experiences with an existing digital system for care integration between hospitals and nursing homes, and the potential of artificial intelligence to contribute to its optimization. The findings reveal challenges regarding (a) untimely information, (b) irrelevant information, (c) confusing information, (d) missing information, (e) information overload, and (f) information multiplicity. Artificial intelligence could address these by (i) identifying and verifying low-quality information, (ii) targeting information for different user groups, (iii) visually summarizing relevant information, and (iv) jointly presenting multiple versions. The implications of these findings extend beyond the context of care integration, presenting empirical evidence for the importance of qualitative health research in, and a model for, determining the scope and design of future artificial intelligence solutions to optimize (health)care processes.","authors":["Anna Schneider-Kamp"],"meta":["May 2021Inquiry: a Journal of Medical Care Organization, Provision and Financing 58(3):004695802110179","DOI:10.1177/00469580211017992"],"references":["338332372_International_evaluation_of_an_AI_system_for_breast_cancer_screening","337012288_A_governance_model_for_the_application_of_AI_in_health_care","328490247_MedSTS_a_resource_for_clinical_semantic_textual_similarity","327419648_Data_Rich_Information_Poor_Can_We_Use_Electronic_Health_Records_to_Create_a_Learning_Healthcare_System_for_Pharmaceuticals","323435915_A_Novel_Approach_for_Fully_Automated_Personalized_Health_Coaching_for_Adults_with_Prediabetes_Pilot_Clinical_Trial","344339960_Emerging_challenges_in_AI_and_the_need_for_AI_ethics_education","342947219_The_disruptive_power_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Ethical_aspects_of_gerontechnology_in_elderly_care","334277365_Rigor_in_Qualitative_Methods_An_Evaluation_of_Strategies_Among_Underrepresented_Rural_Communities","334078404_The_potential_for_artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare","331738199_The_Discovery_of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_for_Qualitative_Research"]}
