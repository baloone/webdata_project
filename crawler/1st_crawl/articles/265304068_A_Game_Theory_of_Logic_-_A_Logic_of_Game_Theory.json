{"id":"265304068_A_Game_Theory_of_Logic_-_A_Logic_of_Game_Theory","abstract":"This paper does not deal with the applications of game theory for which this theory was first developed, that is, for modelling economic systems and rational decision making. But I do not want to consider games as abstract mathematical structures, either. I want to concentrate on what it is that makes a game actually playable. This playability means both the possibility of finding and formulating the strategy that a player uses and the feasibility of actually applying the strategy in question in making oneâ€™s moves.","authors":["Jaakko Hintikka"],"meta":["January 1998","DOI:10.1007/978-94-017-1654-3_25"],"references":["311906352_Extensive_Form_Games","267149415_Recursive_Undecidability--An_Exposition","246377247_Hilbert''s_Tenth_Problem","243768567_The_Principles_of_Mathematics_Revisited","243722695_E_ective_computability_of_winning_strategies","235734038_Game-Theoretical_Semantics","228108243_Communication_on_the_Borel_Notes","227391101_Modeling_Rational_Players_Part_I","226584520_Zur_Theorie_der_Gesellschaftsspiele"]}
