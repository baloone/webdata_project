{"id":"337953729_Coding_Success_through_Math_Intervention_in_an_Elementary_School_in_Rural_Amish_Country","abstract":"Coding in the elementary classroom is a relatively new movement in K-12 education that intends to engage young people in computer science and technology-related study. Coding initiatives focus on introducing young learners to coding and developing their computational thinking abilities. Coding helps enhance problem solving, mathematics skills, and higher-order thinking. Nevertheless, educators face many challenges with teaching coding at the elementary school level, because of the newness of computer science concepts and programming languages, gaps in student mathematics knowledge, use of technology, a relatively short attention span of young students and not fully developed reasoning, logic, and inferential skills among many others. This report describes how math interventions helped elementary school students in rural Amish Country become more successful with their coding activities.","authors":["Megan Brannon","Elena Novak"],"meta":["December 2019","DOI:10.26716/jcsi.2019.02.2.1"],"references":["308919422_Investigation_of_the_Effects_of_Brain_Teasers_on_Attention_Spans_of_Pre-School_Children","306362494_An_analysis_of_young_students'_thinking_when_completing_basic_coding_tasks_using_Scratch_Jnr_On_the_iPad_General_thinking_and_computational_work","285208267_Interactive_Assessment_Tools_for_Computational_Thinking_in_High_School_STEM_Classrooms","274309848_Computational_Thinking","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","285932841_Teacher_Effects_and_the_Achievement_Gap_Do_Teacher_and_Teaching_Quality_Influence_the_Achievement_Gap_Between_Black_and_White_and_High-_and_Low-SES_Students_in_the_Early_Grades","283925079_Age_and_ethnic_variations_in_family_process_mediators_of_SES","282918181_Decreasing_the_SES_math_achievement_gap_Initial_math_proficiency_and_home_learning_environments","281139507_Opportunities_for_Learning_Math_in_Elementary_School_Implications_for_SES_Disparities_in_Procedural_and_Conceptual_Math_Skills","262175270_Digital_playgrounds_for_early_computing_education","258123665_Integrating_computational_thinking_with_K-12_science_education_using_agent-based_computation_A_theoretical_framework","256005803_Computer_Programming_Goes_Back_to_School","234590664_Cognitive_Approaches_to_Teaching_Advanced_Skills_to_Educationally_Disadvantaged_Students","257171388_Problem_solving_by_5-6_years_old_kindergarten_children_in_a_computer_programming_environment_A_case_study","229131503_The_emergence_of_inferential_rules_The_use_of_pragmatic_reasoning_schemas_by_preschoolers"]}
