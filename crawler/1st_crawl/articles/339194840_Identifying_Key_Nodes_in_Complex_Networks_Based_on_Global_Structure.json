{"id":"339194840_Identifying_Key_Nodes_in_Complex_Networks_Based_on_Global_Structure","abstract":"Quantitative identification of key nodes in complex networks is of great significance for studying the robustness and vulnerability of complex networks. Although various centralities have been proposed to solve this issue, each approach has its limitations for its own perspective of determining an actor to be “key”. In this paper, we propose a novel method of identifying key nodes in complex networks based on global structure, which considers the shortest path length, the number of shortest paths and the number of non-shortest paths. Three corresponding influence matrices are constructed and considered to form the comprehensive influence matrix. And node efficiency is selected as the initial value of node’s influence on other nodes. Four experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed method based on Susceptible–Infected (SI) model, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method.","authors":["Yuanzhi Yang","Xing Wang","You Chen","Min Hu"],"meta":["February 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973241"],"references":["324421296_A_Novel_Entropy-Based_Centrality_Approach_for_Identifying_Vital_Nodes_in_Weighted_Networks","321091472_How_to_Identify_the_Most_Powerful_Node_in_Complex_Networks_A_Novel_Entropy_Centrality_Approach","304187414_Functional_characterization_of_somatic_mutations_in_cancer_using_network-based_inference_of_protein_activity","332520532_A_novel_method_to_evaluate_node_importance_in_complex_networks","326522570_Recent_Advances_on_the_Network_Models_in_Target-based_Drug_Discovery","326473535_Network_Based_Drug_Discovery_Coupling_Network_Pharmacology_with_Phenotypic_Screening_for_Neuronal_Excitability","324426307_Identifying_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks_A_node_information_dimension_approach","320767616_Influential_nodes_ranking_in_complex_networks_An_entropy-based_approach","318906436_A_new_method_to_identify_influential_nodes_based_on_combining_of_existing_centrality_measures","304744011_Vital_nodes_identification_in_complex_networks"]}
