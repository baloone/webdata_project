{"id":"339940642_Fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_parallel_permutation-and-diffusion_strategy","abstract":"In the image encryption algorithms, expansion of size and increase of data lead to a large amount of time consumption. To improve the efficiency, the current efforts are mainly limited to the design of streaming encryption algorithms, which do not greatly reduce encryption time and may cause security issues. Therefore, we propose a new image encryption algorithm, which based on the parallel permutation-and-diffusion (PPAD) strategy, and adopt the sub-key cross-fusion method to form the different secret keys in different rounds. The proposed algorithm significantly improves the parallelism of encryption while ensuring security, and achieves an excellent enhancement in efficiency over conventional streaming encryption algorithms. The performance evaluations prove that the proposed strategy has high security to resist common attacks and is suitable for image encryption.","authors":["Xingyuan Wang","Hongyu Zhao"],"meta":["July 2020Multimedia Tools and Applications 79(12):1-20","DOI:10.1007/s11042-020-08810-z"],"references":["330402497_Image_Encryption_with_Double_Spiral_Scans_and_Chaotic_Maps","330071500_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_non-adjacent_dynamically_coupled_map_lattice_model","325520085_Innovative_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_a_new_rapid_hyperchaotic_system_and_random_iterative_permutation","320998283_Adaptive_medical_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_multiple_chaotic_mapping","317174397_Quantum_image_encryption_scheme_with_iterative_generalized_Arnold_transforms_and_quantum_image_cycle_shift_operations","335212164_Image_encryption_algorithm_for_synchronously_updating_Boolean_networks_based_on_matrix_semi-tensor_product_theory","334140258_A_new_image_encryption_algorithm_with_nonlinear-diffusion_based_on_Multiple_coupled_map_lattices","331282715_Fast_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Parallel_Computing_System","327373452_Five_new_4-D_autonomous_conservative_chaotic_systems_with_various_type_of_non-hyperbolic_and_lines_of_equilibria","324641911_A_novel_shuffling_technique_based_on_fractional_chaotic_maps","316806187_Color_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Chaotic_Systems_and_Elliptic_Curve_ElGamal_Scheme","316525838_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_orthogonal_matrix_skew_tent_map_and_XOR_operation","301234351_A_Comprehensive_Evaluation_of_Cryptographic_Algorithms_DES_3DES_AES_RSA_and_Blowfish","301302789_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_substitution-permutation_network_and_chaos","301273723_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_map"]}
