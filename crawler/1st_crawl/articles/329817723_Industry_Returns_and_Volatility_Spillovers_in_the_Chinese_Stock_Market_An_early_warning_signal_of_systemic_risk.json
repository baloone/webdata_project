{"id":"329817723_Industry_Returns_and_Volatility_Spillovers_in_the_Chinese_Stock_Market_An_early_warning_signal_of_systemic_risk","abstract":"This paper studies the intraday return and volatility spillovers of Chinese CSI 300 industry indices with high frequency data between May 2012 and June 2016. The dynamic correlations between industries are calculated with a VEC-DCC-GARCH model. The correlations between CSI 300 industry indices are high but change with fluctuations in the overall index. Spillover indicators are calculated with the generalised variance decomposition method with intraday returns and with volatility. The rolling time window method is applied to construct the return and volatility spillover indices, which were proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) as connectedness, to discover the dynamic characteristics of CSI 300 industry return and volatility spillover effects. We conclude that the dynamic characteristics of return and volatility spillovers are early warning signs for systemic risk, especially the spillover dynamics of the finance and real estate industry. Additional tests are performed with different sample frequencies and forecast steps to prove the robustness of our results.","authors":["Feng He","Zhifeng Liu","Sicen Chen"],"meta":["December 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2888522"],"references":["317013728_Dependence_structure_between_nominal_and_index-linked_bond_returns_A_bivariate_copula_and_DCC-GARCH_approach","322711914_Generalized_approach_to_sparse_and_stable_portfolio_optimization_problem","319610133_Forecasting_the_good_and_bad_uncertainties_of_crude_oil_prices_using_a_HAR_framework","315491230_The_Dynamic_Linkages_between_Crude_Oil_and_Natural_Gas_Markets","313640953_World_National_and_Industry_Factors_in_Equity_Returns","311090865_Dynamics_of_volatility_transmission_between_the_US_and_the_Chinese_agricultural_futures_markets","309891835_The_connectedness_between_crude_oil_and_financial_markets_Evidence_from_implied_volatility_indices","305318793_Asymmetric_spillover_effects_between_the_Shanghai_and_Hong_Kong_stock_markets_evidence_from_quantile_lagged_regression","304661604_CoVaR","301757052_The_directional_volatility_connectedness_between_crude_oil_and_equity_markets_New_evidence_from_implied_volatility_indexes"]}
