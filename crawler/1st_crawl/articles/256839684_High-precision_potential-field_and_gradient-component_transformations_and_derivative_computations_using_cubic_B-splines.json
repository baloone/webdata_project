{"id":"256839684_High-precision_potential-field_and_gradient-component_transformations_and_derivative_computations_using_cubic_B-splines","abstract":"Potential-field and gradient-component transformations\nand derivative computations are necessary for many techniques\nof data enhancement, direct interpretation, and inversion.\nWe advance new unified formulas for fast interpolation,\ndifferentiation, and integration and propose flexible highprecision\nalgorithms to perform 3D and 2D potential-fieldand\ngradient component transformations and derivative computations\nin the space domain using cubic B-splines. The\nspline-based algorithms are applicable to uniform or nonuniform\nrectangular grids for the 3D case and to regular or irregular\ngrids for the 2D case. The fast Fourier transform �FFT�\ntechniques require uniform grid spacing. The spline-based\nhorizontal-derivative computations can be done at any point\nin the computational domain, whereas the FFT methods use\nonly grid points. Comparisons between spline and FFT techniques\nthrough two gravity-gradient examples and one magnetic\nexample show that results computed with the spline\ntechnique agree better with the exact theoretical data than do\nresults computed with the FFT technique.","authors":["Bingzhu Wang","Edward S.
