{"id":"228654443_Predicting_students_drop_out_A_case_study","abstract":"1 In the emerging field of educational data mining, a strong bias towards data-rich digital learning environments is the current state of affairs [2, table 2]. However, in many educational institutes a lot of regular course data will probably be more readily available. This data may also be used to support and advise students in various ways, for the better of the student as well as the institute. In this study, the situation at the Electrical Engineering department of Eindhoven University of Technology is considered. Based on experience, the department claims to be able to distinguish the potentially successful students from amongst the first year influx before the end of the first semester. To do this in an early stage is important for the student as well as for the university, but the selection is only loosely based on assumed student similarities over the years. There is no thorough analysis. Data mining techniques may corroborate and improve the accuracy of this prediction. Furthermore, data mining techniques may point out indicators of academic success that are missed until now.","authors":["Gerben W Dekker"],"meta":["May 2009"],"references":["233782315_Data_Mining_Algorithms_to_Classify_Students","228346963_Determination_of_factors_influencing_the_achievement_of_the_first-year_university_students_using_data_mining_methods","226660887_The_determination_of_factors_related_to_academic_achievement_in_the_university_Implications_for_the_selection_and_counselling_of_students","224299912_A_comparative_analysis_of_techniques_for_predicting_academic_performance","222815211_Educational_data_mining_A_survey_from_1995_to_2005","221570467_Predicting_Students_Drop_Out_A_Case_Study","221570435_Data_Mining_Algorithms_to_Classify_Students","221570394_Mining_the_Student_Assessment_Data_Lessons_Drawn_from_a_Small_Scale_Case_Study","220814000_Decision_Tree_Grafting","2478153_Decision_Tree_Grafting","240092500_The_Limits_of_Theory_and_Practice_in_Student_Attrition","227524012_Estimating_student_retention_and_degree-completion_time_Decision_trees_and_neural_networks_vis-a-vis_regression","226285173_Predicting_Freshman_Persistence_and_Voluntary_Dropout_Decisions_A_Replication","225507299_Measuring_Determinants_of_Student_Return_VS_DropoutStopout_VS_Transfer_A_First-to-Second_Year_Analysis_of_New_Freshmen","221900847_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_And_Techniques","221900819_Discovering_Knowledge_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Data_Mining","200110620_Introduction_to_Data_Mining","24079239_Why_Do_Higher_Education_Students_Drop_Out_Evidence_from_Spain"]}
