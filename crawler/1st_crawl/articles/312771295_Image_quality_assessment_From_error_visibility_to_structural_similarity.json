{"id":"312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","abstract":"Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality have traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a Structural Similarity Index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MatLab implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/ssim/.","authors":["Z. Wang","Alan Bovik","H.R. Sheikh","Eero P.
