{"id":"322721511_Voice_Interfaces_in_Everyday_Life","abstract":"Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via ‘assistant’ devices. Yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. By collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the Amazon Echo in participants’ homes—informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis—our study documents the methodical practices of VUI users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. Data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. We discuss how the VUI is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. Finally, we locate implications for the accountability of VUI interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing ‘conversational’ interfaces.","authors":["Martin Porcheron","Joel E Fischer","Stuart Reeves","Sarah Sharples"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1145/3173574.3174214","Conference: ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2018)"],"references":["317575120_Media_Multitasking_at_Home_A_Video_Observation_Study_of_Concurrent_TV_and_Mobile_Device_Usage","313809149_Talking_with_Conversational_Agents_in_Collaborative_Action","313738237_More_to_Meetings_Challenges_in_Using_Speech-Based_Technology_to_Support_Meetings","300117871_Configuring_Attention_in_the_Multiscreen_Living_Room","291349911_The_Tyranny_of_the_Everyday_in_Mobile_Video_Messaging","283618186_A_Simplest_Systematics_for_the_Organization_of_Turn-Taking_for_Conversation","281427859_Computational_Sociolinguistics_A_Survey","280745816_Sequence_Organization_in_Interaction_A_Primer_in_Conversation_Analysis","271808373_Analyzing_Single_Episodes_of_Interaction_An_Exercise_in_Conversation_Analysis","271514587_Feature-Frequency-Adaptive_On-line_Training_for_Fast_and_Accurate_Natural_Language_Processing","265943241_Designing_Relational_Agents_as_Long_Term_Social_Companions_for_Older_Adults","262281847_Virtual_Butlers_and_Real_People_Styles_and_Practices_in_Long-Term_Use_of_a_Companion","245068317_A_simple_system_for_the_organization_of_turn-taking_im_conversation","242070747_On_the_Naturalness_of_Touchless_Putting_the_Interaction_Back_into_NUI","234826133_On_Technomethodology_Foundational_Relationships_Between_Ethnomethodology_and_System_Design","234147648_Conversation_Analysis","221588292_A_Conversational_Agent_as_Museum_Guide_-_Design_and_Evaluation_of_a_Real-World_Application","221441456_Supporting_ethnographic_studies_of_ubiquitous_computing_in_the_wild","221419743_InCA_A_mobile_conversational_agent","220879489_Deploying_research_technology_in_the_home","220878771_Are_you_watching_this_film_or_what_Interruption_and_the_juggling_of_cohorts","220566652_Spoken_Dialogue_Technology_Enabling_the_Conversational_User_Interface","26317611_Universals_and_cultural_variation_in_turn-taking_in_conversation","3333682_JUPITER_A_telephone-based_conversational_interface_for_weather_information","325495857_Pragmatics","324353055_Lectures_on_Conversation","316268744_The_Conversational_Interface","309702865_Do_Animals_Have_Accents_Talking_with_Agents_in_Multi-Party_Conversation","301936017_Smartwatch_in_vivo","301931234_Like_Having_a_Really_Bad_PA_The_Gulf_between_User_Expectation_and_Experience_of_Conversational_Agents","301931091_Why_That_Nao_How_Humans_Adapt_to_a_Conventional_Humanoid_Robot_in_Taking_Turns-at-Talk","291828960_Embeddedness_and_sequentiality_in_social_media","286623385_Video_in_Qualitative_Research_Analysing_Social_Interaction_in_Everyday_Life","262391753_How_do_users_respond_to_voice_input_errors_lexical_and_phonetic_query_reformulation_in_voice_search","250961903_Applying_Sociology_Conversation_Analysis_in_the_Study_of_HumanSimulated_Computer_Interaction1","202187153_Studies_In_Ethnomethodology","200134821_Organising_Computer_Talk","50382537_Alone_Together_Why_We_Expect_More_from_Technology_and_Less_From_Each_Other","3486121_Man-Computer_Symbiosis"]}
