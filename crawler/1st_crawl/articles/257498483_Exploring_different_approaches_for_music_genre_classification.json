{"id":"257498483_Exploring_different_approaches_for_music_genre_classification","abstract":"In this letter, we present different approaches for music genre classification. The proposed techniques, which are composed of a feature extraction stage followed by a classification procedure, explore both the variations of parameters used as input and the classifier architecture. Tests were carried out with three styles of music, namely blues, classical, and lounge, which are considered informally by some musicians as being “big dividers” among music genres, showing the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and establishing a relationship between the relevance of each set of parameters for each music style and each classifier. In contrast to other works, entropies and fractal dimensions are the features adopted for the classifications.","authors":["Antonio Jose Homsi Goulart","Rodrigo Guido","Carlos Maciel"],"meta":["July 2012Egyptian Informatics Journal 13(2):59–63","DOI:10.1016/j.eij.2012.03.001"],"references":["247733337_Aspects_of_Stylistic_Knowledge_What_Are_Different_Styles_Like_and_Why_Do_We_Listen_to_Them","237791328_MULTIEXPERT_SYSTEM_FOR_AUTOMATIC_MUSIC_GENRE_CLASSIFICATION","228058014_Pattern_Classification","309076436_Musical_genre_classification_Is_it_worth_pursuing_and_how_can_it_be_improved","267438857_Fractal_speech_processing","261662232_Elements_of_Information_Theory","242605725_Automatic_Musical_Genre_Classification_Using_Divergence_and_Average_Information_Measures","242483649_A_Dynamic_and_Optimization-Oriented_Approach","239066308_Liking_for_Musical_Styles","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","221299170_A_Comparative_Study_on_Content-Based_Music_Genre_Classification","220723016_Automatic_Musical_Genre_Classification_of_Audio_Signals","220327485_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Automatic_Music_Genre_Classification","224773133_Elements_of_information_theory_2nd_ed","220656193_Musical_Genre_Classification_of_Audio_Signals"]}
