{"id":"263352347_Fitting_Linear_Mixed-Effects_Models_Using_lme4","abstract":"Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the\nparameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer\nfunction in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R,\nthe model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including\nboth fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a\nnumerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the\nprofiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model\nparameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the\nconstrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We\ndescribe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled\ndeviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that\nrepresents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization\nof these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized\nlinear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing\nsplines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.","authors":["Douglas M.
