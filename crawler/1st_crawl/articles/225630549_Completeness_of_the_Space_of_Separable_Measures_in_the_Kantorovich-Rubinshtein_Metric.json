{"id":"225630549_Completeness_of_the_Space_of_Separable_Measures_in_the_Kantorovich-Rubinshtein_Metric","abstract":"We consider the space M(X) of separable measures on the Borel σ-algebra ℬ(X) of a metric space X. The space M(X) is furnished with the Kantorovich-Rubinshtein metric known also as the “Hutchinson distance” (see [1]). We prove that M(X) is complete if and only if X is complete. We consider applications of this theorem in the theory of selfsimilar fractals.","authors":["A. S.
