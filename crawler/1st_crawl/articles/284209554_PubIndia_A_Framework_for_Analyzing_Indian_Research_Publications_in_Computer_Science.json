{"id":"284209554_PubIndia_A_Framework_for_Analyzing_Indian_Research_Publications_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"This paper describes PubIndia, a framework for analyzing the growth and impact of research activities performed in India in the computer science domain, based on the evidence of scientific publications. We gathered and analyzed a massive publication dataset of more than 2.5 million papers in the computer science domain with rich metadata information associated with each paper. Specifically, we attempted to analyze the temporal evolution of the collaboration pattern and the shift in research work among different topics, and made a thorough comparison between Indian and Chinese research activities. A preliminary analysis on a subset of papers on Natural Language Processing extracted from the large dataset revealed that Indian researchers tend to collaborate with researchers outside of India quite often; however Chinese researchers tend to work among themselves. We also show the evolutionary landscape of different keywords that indicate how the importance of individual keywords varies over the years.","authors":["Mayank Singh","Soumajit Pramanick","Tanmoy Chakraborty"],"meta":["November 2015D-Lib Magazine 21(11/12)","DOI:10.1045/november2015-singh"],"references":["254077910_The_Structure_of_a_Social_Science_Collaboration_Network_Disciplinary_Cohesion_from_1963_to_1999","223982835_A_scientometric_analysis_of_Indian_research_output_in_medicine_during_1999-2008","221620547_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","221347768_KEA_Practical_Automatic_Keyphrase_Extraction","220365243_Is_science_becoming_more_interdisciplinary_Measuring_and_mapping_six_research_fields_over_time","45694839_Biomedical_Journals_in_India_Some_critical_concerns","271913939_Citation_interactions_among_computer_science_fields_A_quantitative_route_to_the_rise_and_fall_of_scientific_research","262285230_Trends_in_Computer_Science_Research","248729836_The_structure_of_a_social_science_collaboration_network","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation"]}
