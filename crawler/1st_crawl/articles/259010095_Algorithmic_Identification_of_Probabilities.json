{"id":"259010095_Algorithmic_Identification_of_Probabilities","abstract":"The problem is to identify a probability mass function associated with a\ndiscrete set, given an infinite data sequence of elements from the set. If the\ngiven sequence is drawn i.i.d. and the probability mass function is computable\nand has a finite mean, then there is an algorithm to almost surely identify the\ntarget in the limit. If the probability mass function is incomputable, has a\nfinite mean, and the drawing is i.i.d., then there is an algorithm which\npointwise converges to the target almost surely. Here we use the strong law of\nlarge numbers. If the elements of the sequence are dependent and the sequence\nis typical (random) for at least one computable measure and the set is finite,\nthen there is an algorithm to almost surely identify in the limit a computable\nmeasure for which the sequence is typical (there may be more than one such\nmeasure). Here we use the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We give the\nalgorithms and consider the associated predictions.","authors":["Paul M. B.
