{"id":"321688649_A_Block-Based_Division_Reversible_Data_Hiding_Method_in_Encrypted_Images","abstract":"Due to the increased digital media on the Internet, data security and privacy protection issue have attracted the attention of data communication. Data hiding has become a topic of considerable importance. Nowadays, a new challenge consists of reversible data hiding in the encrypted image because of the correlations of local pixels that are destroyed in an encrypted image; it is difficult to embed secret messages in encrypted images using the difference of neighboring pixels. In this paper, the proposed method uses a block-based division mask and a new encrypted method based on the logistic map and an additive homomorphism to embed data in an encrypted image by histogram shifting technique. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher payload than other works and is more immune to attack upon the cryptosystem.","authors":["Wei-Liang Liu","Hui-Shih Leng","Chuan-Kuei Huang","Dyi-Cheng Chen"],"meta":["December 2017Symmetry 9(12):308","DOI:10.3390/sym9120308"],"references":["316450892_Enhanced_Joint_and_Separable_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images_with_High_Payload","313455104_Separable_reversible_data_hiding_in_encrypted_image_based_on_pixel_value_ordering_and_additive_homomorphism","309446753_Binary-Block_Embedding_for_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images","303320424_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images_by_Reversible_Image_Transformation","283276529_Reversible_data_hiding_in_encrypted_images_using_cross_division_and_additive_homomorphism","282501552_Reversible_data_hiding_in_encrypted_image_using_new_embedding_pattern_and_multiple_judgments","276067210_High_Capacity_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images_by_Patch-Level_Sparse_Representation","275986554_A_Modified_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images_Using_Random_Diffusion_and_Accurate_Prediction","275110466_Reversible_data_hiding_based_on_two-dimensional_prediction_errors","274738122_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images_With_Distributed_Source_Encoding"]}
