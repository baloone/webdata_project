{"id":"355474776_DATA_ANALYTICS_FOR_RESHAPING_THE_RESTAURANT_INDUSTRY","abstract":"Restaurants generate massive amounts of data, which, when utilized properly, may be a treasure trove for a restaurant's success. The next question is what technologies restaurants can use to collect and organize this data so that it can be examined and used to make decisions. Apart from the obvious choices of Python, R, Excel, and Tableau. We saw that numerous approaches and algorithms are used to efficiently solve problems in the field of computer science; we speculated that these techniques and algorithms could be utilized to solve problems in a different field, such as the restaurant industry. Although restaurant data analytics aren't a miracle solution for increasing sales overnight, they can help. Making a lucrative business decision can also be done using a variety of strategies and algorithms.","authors":["Pooja Harugop","Tejashwini Matgar","Zakiyaameen Pachapuri","Amit Kulkarni"],"meta":["October 2021","DOI:10.6084/m9.doi.one.IJCRT2110223"],"references":["321676403_Aspect_based_opinion_mining_on_restaurant_reviews","234823236_ClientServer_Computing","220689087_Introduction_to_client_server_systems_-_a_practical_guide_for_systems_professionals_2_ed","31738157_Foundations_of_Object-Oriented_Languages_Types_and_Semantics_KB_Bruce"]}
