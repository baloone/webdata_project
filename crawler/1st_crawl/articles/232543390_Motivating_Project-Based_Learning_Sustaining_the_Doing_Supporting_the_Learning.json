{"id":"232543390_Motivating_Project-Based_Learning_Sustaining_the_Doing_Supporting_the_Learning","abstract":"Describes project-based learning as a comprehensive approach to classroom teaching and learning that is designed to engage students in investigation of authentic problems. Students are responsible for both the questions and the answers to such problems. Some of the advantages of project-based learning are that it promotes links among different disciplines and is adaptable to different types of learners and situations. Factors in project design that affect motivation and thought include interest in and value of the project, perceived and achieved competence, and task focus. The role of teachers in enhancing motivation and fostering cognitive engagement is emphasized. Ways in which technology can support students and teachers as they work on projects, so that motivation and thought are sustained, are described.
