{"id":"283836064_Beyond_the_Runs_Theorem","abstract":"In [3], a short and elegant proof was presented showing that a word of length n contains at most n - 3 runs. Here we show, using the same technique and a computer search, that the number of runs in a binary word of length n is at most 22/23n < 0.957n.","authors":["Johannes Fischer","Štěpán Holub","I.
