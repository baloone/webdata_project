{"id":"248701403_Screencast_Tutorials_Enhance_Student_Learning_of_Statistics","abstract":"Although the use of computer-assisted instruction has rapidly increased, there is little empirical research evaluating these technologies, specifically within the context of teaching statistics. The authors assessed the effect of screencast tutorials on learning outcomes, including statistical knowledge, application, and interpretation. Students from four sections of a psychology course in statistics were randomly assigned to a control text tutorial or an experimental video tutorial group and were tasked with completing a novel statistics problem. Previous math experience, math and computer anxiety, and course grades were also controlled. The results demonstrate that screencast tutorials are an effective and efficient tool for enhancing student learning, especially for higher order conceptual statistical knowledge compared to traditional instructional techniques.","authors":["Steven A.
