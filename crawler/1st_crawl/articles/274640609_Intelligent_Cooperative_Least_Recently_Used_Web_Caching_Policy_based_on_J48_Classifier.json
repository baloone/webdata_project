{"id":"274640609_Intelligent_Cooperative_Least_Recently_Used_Web_Caching_Policy_based_on_J48_Classifier","abstract":"Web caching plays a key role in delivering web objects to the end-users which is one of the advantages of World Wide Web (WWW). However, the size of the cache is limited which is considered as one of the drawbacks of web caching. Furthermore , retrieving the same web object from the origin server many times consumes the network bandwidth. Moreover, cache pollution is a drawback of traditional web caching policies such as Least Recently Used (LRU) web caching policy where web objects that are stored in the cache are not visited frequently. In this work, new intelligent cooperative web caching approach based on J48 classifier is presented. A simulation is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that the new approach improves the performance of the LRU web caching policy.","authors":["Waheed Yasin"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1145/2684200.2684299","Conference: iiWASAt: Hanoi, VietnamVolume: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services iiWAS2014"],"references":["274640594_Windows_web_proxy_caching_simulation_A_tool_for_simulating_web_proxy_caching_under_windows_operating_systems","257391656_Intelligent_Naive_Bayes-based_approaches_for_Web_proxy_caching","257015607_Intelligent_Web_proxy_caching_approaches_based_on_machine_learning_techniques","246044806_An_Overview_of_Media_Streams_Caching_in_Peer-to-Peer_Systems","221349025_Role_of_Aging_Frequency_and_Size_in_Web_Cache_Replacement_Policies","251795896_Structured_peer-to-peer_systems_for_telecommunications_and_mobile_environments","225201160_Content_Location_in_Peer-to-Peer_Systems_Exploiting_Locality","224584661_Training_of_NNPCR-2_An_improved_neural_network_proxy_cache_replacement_strategy","223697267_Cooperative_caching_by_clients_constructing_a_peer-to-peer_network_for_push-based_broadcast","222346711_Web_cache_optimization_with_nonlinear_model_using_object_features"]}
