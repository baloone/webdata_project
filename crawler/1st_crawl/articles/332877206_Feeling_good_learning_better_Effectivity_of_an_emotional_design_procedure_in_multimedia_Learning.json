{"id":"332877206_Feeling_good_learning_better_Effectivity_of_an_emotional_design_procedure_in_multimedia_Learning","abstract":"Emotional designing describes the elicitation of positive affect during learning through specific design elements of the learning environment to enhance learning. This experimental study examined the effectivity of an emotional design procedure on learning performance. Moreover, the learner’s affective states before learning were taken into consideration as possible moderators. 145 university students learned for 20 min either in a multimedia positive affect inducing learning environment (n = 85) or a neutral multimedia learning environment (n = 60). The Affect was measured before, during, and after learning. Performance was tested afterwards. To control for possible confounding effects, achievement motivation, emotion regulation, and situational interest were measured. In contrast to earlier findings, no superiority effect of the emotional design procedure was found. Furthermore, the effectivity of the emotional design procedure was not moderated by student’s prior effective states. However, there was a main influence of student’s positive affect on transfer performance.","authors":["Maria Bannert","Hannes Muenchow"],"meta":["May 2019Educational Psychology","DOI:10.1080/01443410.2018.1524852"],"references":["318952989_The_Better_You_Feel_the_Better_You_Learn_Do_Warm_Colours_and_Rounded_Shapes_Enhance_Learning_Outcome_in_Multimedia_Learning","269728083_Emotional_design_in_multimedia_learning_Differentiation_on_relevant_design_features_and_their_effects_on_emotions_and_learning","253772914_Nine_Ways_to_Reduce_Cognitive_Load_in_Multimedia_Learning","247398603_FAM_Ein_Fragebogen_zur_Erfassung_aktuller_Motivation_in_Lern-_und_Leistungssituationen","247397346_Entwicklung_und_Validierung_eines_Fragebogens_zur_standardisierten_Selbsteinschatzung_emotionaler_Kompetenzen_SEK-27","228079340_Untersuchungen_mit_einer_deutschen_Version_der_Positive_and_Negative_Affect_Schedule_PANAS","225530683_The_Influence_of_Positive_Affect_on_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Motivation_Facilitating_Enjoyment_of_Play_Responsible_Work_Behavior_and_Self-Control","47544150_Better_Mood_and_Better_Performance_Learning_Rule-Described_Categories_Is_Enhanced_by_Positive_Mood","43345682_An_ecological_valence_theory_of_color_preferences","38075044_Statistical_Power_Analyses_Using_GPower_31_Tests_for_Correlation_and_Regression_Analyses","23983380_Blue_or_Red_Exploring_the_Effect_of_Color_on_Cognitive_Task_Performances","15176872_Children's_Emotional_Associations_with_Colors","312431537_PA_facilitates_creative_problem_solving","309313629_Emotional_Design_in_Digital_Media_for_Learning","304860437_Multimedia_Learning_Second_Edition","304716322_Instructional_technology_Promise_and_pitfalls","303516607_Interest_and_enjoyment","303266011_Concepts_and_structures_of_emotions","301739865_Facilitators_or_suppressors_Effects_of_experimentally_induced_emotions_on_multimedia_learning","299488862_Decorative_pictures_and_emotional_design_in_multimedia_learning","289066201_Introduction_to_Mediation_Moderation_and_Conditional_Process_Analysis_A_Regression-Based_Approach","286266308_Emotions_During_the_Learning_of_Difficult_Material","273792377_Emotional_Design_and_Positive_Emotions_in_Multimedia_Learning_An_Eyetracking_Study_on_the_Use_of_Anthropomorphisms","263269940_Rethinking_the_Role_of_Positive_Affect_in_Self-Regulation","260914087_Benefits_of_emotional_design_in_multimedia_instruction","259137984_Cognitive_and_affective_processes_in_multimedia_learning","259137979_Emotional_design_in_multimedia_learning_Effects_of_shape_and_color_on_affect_and_learning","247699111_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives_The_Classification_of_Educational_Objectives","247497005_Beyond_test_anxiety_Development_and_validation_of_the_Test_Emotions_Questionnaire_TEQ","245453286_Applied_Multiple_Regression_Correlation_Analysis_for_The_Behavioral_Sciences","235726247_Development_and_Validation_of_Brief_Measures_of_Positive_and_Negative_Affect_The_PANAS_Scales","233893904_Color_and_Psychological_Functioning","232583211_Some_Components_and_Consequences_of_a_Babyface","232533746_Different_Strokes_for_Different_Folks_How_Individual_Interest_Moderates_the_Effects_of_Situational_Factors_on_Task_Interest","232508142_Emotional_Design_in_Multimedia_Learning","229060097_Emotion_as_a_Multicomponent_Process_A_Model_and_some_Cross-cultural_Data","227033633_Interactive_Multimodal_Learning_Environments","225704792_Achievement_Goals_and_Achievement_Emotions_A_Meta-analysis","225610891_The_Control-Value_Theory_of_Achievement_Emotions_Assumptions_Corollaries_and_Implications_for_Educational_Research_and_Practice","222745338_Designing_emotionally_evocative_homepages_An_empirical_study_of_the_quantitative_relations_between_design_factors_and_emotional_dimensions","222720764_Task_type_poster_and_workspace_color_on_mood_satisfaction_and_performance","47666113_Statistik_und_Forschungsmethoden","21922928_Comparison_of_fixed_interval_and_visual_analogue_scale_for_rating_pain","20376421_Effect_of_Colour_on_Physical_Strength_and_Mood_in_Children","14445563_A_Note_on_Adults'_Color-Emotion_Associations"]}
