{"id":"309382390_Italian_domination_in_trees","abstract":"The Roman domination number and Italian domination number (also known as the Roman -domination number) are graph labeling problems in which each vertex is labeled with either , , or . In the Roman domination problem, each vertex labeled must be adjacent to at least one vertex labeled . In the Italian domination problem, each vertex labeled must have the labels of the vertices in its closed neighborhood sum to at least two. The Italian domination number, , of a graph is the minimum possible sum of such a labeling, where the sum is taken over all the vertices in . It is known that if is a tree with at least two vertices, then . In this paper, we characterize the trees for which , and we characterize the trees for which .","authors":["Michael A.
