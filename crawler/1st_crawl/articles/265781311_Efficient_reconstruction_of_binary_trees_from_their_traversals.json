{"id":"265781311_Efficient_reconstruction_of_binary_trees_from_their_traversals","abstract":"Given the n nodes of a binary tree in both inorder and preorder sequence, the tree can be uniquely identified. An efficient algorithm for reconstructing such trees from their sequences is presented, using O(n) time and O(h) intermediate storage, where h is the height of the tree being reconstructed.","authors":["Robert Douglas Cameron","Binay Bhattacharya","E.A.T.
