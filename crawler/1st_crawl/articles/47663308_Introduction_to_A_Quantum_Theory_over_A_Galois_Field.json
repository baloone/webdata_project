{"id":"47663308_Introduction_to_A_Quantum_Theory_over_A_Galois_Field","abstract":"We consider a quantum theory based on a Galois field. In this approach infinities cannot exist, the cosmological constant problem does not arise, and one irreducible representation (IR) of the symmetry algebra splits into independent IRs describing a particle an its antiparticle only in the approximation when de Sitter energies are much less than the characteristic of the field. As a consequence, the very notions of particles and antiparticles are only approximate and such additive quantum numbers as the electric, baryon and lepton charges are conserved only in this approximation. There can be no neutral elementary particles and the spin-statistics theorem can be treated simply as a requirement that standard quantum theory should be based on complex numbers.
