{"id":"234802005_KNIME_-_the_Konstanz_information_miner","abstract":"The Konstanz Information Miner is a modular environment, which enables easy visual assembly and interactive execution of a data pipeline. It is designed as a teaching, research and collaboration platform, which enables simple integration of new algorithms and tools as well as data manipulation or visualization methods in the form of new modules or nodes. In this paper we describe some of the design aspects of the underlying architecture, briey sketch how new nodes can be incorporated, and highlight some of the new features of version 2.0.","authors":["Michael R Berthold","Nicolas Cebron","Fabian Dill","Thomas R.
