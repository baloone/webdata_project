{"id":"306067883_Enhanced_Merge_Sort-_A_New_Approach_to_the_Merging_Process","abstract":"One of the major fundamental issues of Computer Science is arrangement of elements in the database. The efficiency of the sorting algorithms is to optimize the importance of other sorting algorithms11. The optimality of these sorting algorithms is judged while calculating their time and space complexities12. The idea behind this paper is to modify the conventional Merge Sort Algorithm and to present a new method with reduced execution time. The newly proposed algorithm is faster than the conventional Merge Sort algorithm having a time complexity of O(n log2 n). The proposed algorithm has been tested, implemented, compared and the experimental results are promising.","authors":["Smita Paira","Sourabh Chandra","Sk Safikul Alam"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Computer Science 93:982-987","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2016.07.292"],"references":["280697995_Doubly_Inserted_Sort_A_Partially_Insertion_Based_Dual_Scanned_Sorting_Algorithm","276847633_A_Review_Report_on_Divide_and_Conquer_Sorting_Algorithm","276410736_Max_Min_Sorting_Algorithm_A_New_Sorting_Approach","276410559_Max_Min_Sorting_Algorithm_A_New_Sorting_Approach","268635910_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_A_First_Course","228057630_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms","225028880_Design_and_Analysis_of_Algorithms","220431006_Analysis_of_Internal_Computer_Sorting","220331188_Divide-and-Conquer_for_Parallel_Processing","216457274_The_Art_Of_Computer_Programming_Vol3_Sorting_and_Searching"]}
