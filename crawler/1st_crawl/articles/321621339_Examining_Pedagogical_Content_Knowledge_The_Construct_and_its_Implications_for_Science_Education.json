{"id":"321621339_Examining_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_The_Construct_and_its_Implications_for_Science_Education","abstract":"Since its emergence over two decades ago, the construct of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) has significantly impacted preservice and inservice teacher education, educational policy, and educational research. PCK has served to re-focus educators' attention on the important role of subject matter in educational practice and away from the more generic approach to teacher education that dominated the field prior to 1975.\nThis ambitious text is the first of its kind to summarize the theory, research, and practice related to pedagogical content knowledge. The audience is provided with a functional understanding of the basic tenets of the construct as well as its applications to research on science teacher education and the development of science teacher education programs. The authors are prominent educators representing a variety of subject matter areas and K-12 grade levels. Although the focus of the text is science education, it should provide valuable reading for any individuals with interests in professional teacher education.","authors":["Julie Gess‚ÄêNewsome","Norman G.
