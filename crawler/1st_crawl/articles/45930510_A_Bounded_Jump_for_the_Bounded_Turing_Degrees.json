{"id":"45930510_A_Bounded_Jump_for_the_Bounded_Turing_Degrees","abstract":"We define the bounded jump of A by A^b = {x | Exists i <= x [phi_i (x)\nconverges and Phi_x^[A|phi_i(x)](x) converges} and let A^[nb] denote the n-th\nbounded jump. We demonstrate several properties of the bounded jump, including\nthat it is strictly increasing and order preserving on the bounded Turing (bT)\ndegrees (also known as the weak truth-table degrees). We show that the bounded\njump is related to the Ershov hierarchy. Indeed, for n > 1 we have X <=_[bT]\n0^[nb] iff X is omega^n-c.e. iff X <=_1 0^[nb], extending the classical result\nthat X <=_[bT] 0' iff X is omega-c.e. Finally, we prove that the analogue of\nShoenfield inversion holds for the bounded jump on the bounded Turing degrees.\nThat is, for every X such that 0^b <=_[bT] X <=_[bT] 0^[2b], there is a Y\n<=_[bT] 0^b such that Y^b =_[bT] X.","authors":["Bernard Anderson","Barbara F.
