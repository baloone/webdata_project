{"id":"265898009_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_Set_Cover_Problem","abstract":"Recently, a new approach to get a deeper understanding of online computation has been introduced: the study of the advice complexity of online problems. The idea is to measure the information that online algorithms need to be supplied with to compute high-quality solutions and to overcome the drawback of not knowing future input requests. In this paper, we study the advice complexity of an online version of the well-known set cover problem introduced by Alon et al.: for a ground set of size n and a set family of m subsets of the ground set, we obtain bounds in both n and m. We prove that a linear number of advice bits is both sufficient and necessary to perform optimally. Furthermore, for any constant c, we prove that n-c bits are enough to construct a c-competitive online algorithm and this bound is tight up to a constant factor (only depending on c). Moreover, we show that a linear number of advice bits is both necessary and sufficient to be optimal with respect to m, as well. We further show lower and upper bounds for achieving c-competitiveness also in m.","authors":["Dennis Komm","Richard Královič","Tobias Mömke"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-30642-6_23","Conference: International Computer Science Symposium in Russia"],"references":["234784007_Amortized_efficiency_of_list_update_paging_rules","226657157_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_Online_Problems","225124948_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220223456_On_the_Power_of_Randomization_in_On-Line_Algorithms","268890955_Design_and_analysis_of_randomized_algorithms_Introduction_to_design_paradigms","267783122_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_Knapsack_Problem","262238486_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","247014331_On_Online_Computation_Approximation_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems","226462898_Ein_Satz_uber_Untermengen_einer_endlichen_Menge","225492195_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_k-Server_Problem","225405943_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","225316095_How_Much_Information_about_the_Future_Is_Needed","221591836_Towards_polynomial_lower_bounds_for_dynamic_problems","221513077_Advice_Complexity_and_Barely_Random_Algorithms","220898782_Online_Computation_with_Advice","220780343_A_Little_Advice_Can_Be_Very_Helpful","220695185_Algorithmics_for_hard_problems_-_introduction_to_combinatorial_optimization_randomization_approximation_and_heuristics","220689517_Online_Computation_and_Competitive_Analyses","220589432_Online_algorithms_A_survey","220165528_Measuring_the_problem-relevant_information_in_input","2858575_On_Online_Computation","2847174_The_Online_Set_Cover_Problem"]}
