{"id":"317131512_BlochSolver_A_GPU-optimized_fast_3D_MRI_simulator_for_experimentally_compatible_pulse_sequences","abstract":"A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulator, which reproduces MRI experiments using computers, has been developed using two graphic-processor-unit (GPU) boards (GTX 1080). The MRI simulator was developed to run according to pulse sequences used in experiments. Experiments and simulations were performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the MRI simulator for three types of pulse sequences, namely, three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo, 3D radio-frequency spoiled gradient-echo, and gradient-echo multislice with practical matrix sizes. The results demonstrated that the calculation speed using two GPU boards was typically about 7 TFLOPS and about 14 times faster than the calculation speed using CPUs (two 18-core Xeons). We also found that MR images acquired by experiment could be reproduced using an appropriate number of subvoxels, and that 3D isotropic and two-dimensional multislice imaging experiments for practical matrix sizes could be simulated using the MRI simulator. Therefore, we concluded that such powerful MRI simulators are expected to become an indispensable tool for MRI research and development.","authors":["Ryoichi Kose","Katsumi Kose"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Magnetic Resonance 281","DOI:10.1016/j.jmr.2017.05.007"],"references":["263746625_High_performance_MRI_simulations_of_motion_on_multi-GPU_systems","260527111_MRISIMUL_a_GPU-based_parallel_approach_to_MRI_simulations","225271674_Development_of_a_pulse_programmer_for_magnetic_resonance_imaging_using_a_personal_computer_and_a_high-speed_digital_input-output_board","51484426_Simulation_of_High-Resolution_Magnetic_Resonance_Images_on_the_IBM_Blue_GeneL_Supercomputer_Using_SIMRI","40729773_Bloch_simulations_with_intra-voxel_spin_dephasing","21410914_Spoiling_of_Transverse_Magnetization_in_Steady-State_Sequences","308037039_Nuclear_induction","284826603_Physical_Review","261744422_Extended_Phase_Graphs_Dephasing_RF_Pulses_and_Echoes_-_Pure_and_Simple","256449672_Bloch-based_MRI_system_simulator_considering_realistic_electromagnetic_fields_for_calculation_of_signal_noise_and_specific_absorption_rate","250747921_An_efficient_highly_homogeneous_radiofrequency_coil_for_whole-body_NMR_imaging_at_15_T","243152905_Time_Domain_Simulation_of_Fourier_Imaging_by_Summation_of_Isochromats","230675499_Bloch_Equations_with_Diffusion_Term","230526061_Direct_simulation_of_spin_echoes_by_summation_of_isochromats","229623802_Development_of_a_Flexible_Pulse_Programmer_for_MRI_Using_a_Commercial_Digital_Signal_Processor_Board","44799985_High-performance_computing_MRI_simulations_Magn_Reson_Med_641p186-p193","44640040_Optimal_Radiofrequency_and_Gradient_Spoiling_for_Improved_Accuracy_of_T1_and_B1_Measurements_Using_Fast_Steady-State_Techniques","26858687_The_integration_of_real_and_virtual_magnetic_resonance_imaging_experiments_in_a_single_instrument","19407146_A_Computer_Simulation_of_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","19074188_Susceptibility_artifacts_in_NMR_Imaging","16665227_A_Computer_Algorithm_for_the_Simulation_of_any_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_NMR_Imaging_Method","11795326_Development_of_a_10_T_MR_microscope_using_a_Nd-Fe-B_permanent_magnet","10699798_Super-parallel_MR_microscope","8638500_MRI_Simulator_with_object-specific_field_map_calculations","8426761_Development_of_a_compact_MRI_system_for_trabecular_bone_volume_fraction_measurements","8026624_The_SIMRI_project_a_versatile_and_interactive_MRI_simulator","7339729_Efficient_simulation_of_magnetic_resonance_imaging_with_Bloch-Torrey_equations_using_intra-voxel_magnetization_gradients","6544529_Development_of_a_compact_MRI_system_for_measuring_the_trabecular_bone_microstructure_of_the_finger","6183418_Development_of_a_compact_MRI_system_for_trabecular_bone_microstructure_measurements_of_the_distal_radius","3221036_MRI_simulation-based_evaluation_of_image-processing_and_classification_methods"]}
