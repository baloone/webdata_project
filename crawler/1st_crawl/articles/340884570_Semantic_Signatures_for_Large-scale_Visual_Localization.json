{"id":"340884570_Semantic_Signatures_for_Large-scale_Visual_Localization","abstract":"Visual localization is a useful alternative to standard localization techniques. It works by utilizing cameras. In a typical scenario, features are extracted from captured images and compared with geo-referenced databases. Location information is then inferred from the matching results. Conventional schemes mainly use low-level visual features. These approaches offer good accuracy but suffer from scalability issues. In order to assist localization in large urban areas, this work explores a different path by utilizing high-level semantic information. It is found that object information in a street view can facilitate localization. A novel descriptor scheme called “semantic signature” is proposed to summarize this information. A semantic signature consists of type and angle information of visible objects at a spatial location. Several metrics and protocols are proposed for signature comparison and retrieval. They illustrate different trade-offs between accuracy and complexity. Extensive simulation results confirm the potential of the proposed scheme in large-scale applications. This paper is an extended version of a conference paper in CBMI’18. A more efficient retrieval protocol is presented with additional experiment results.","authors":["Li Weng","Valérie Gouet-Brunet","Bahman Soheilian"],"meta":["June 2021Multimedia Tools and Applications","DOI:10.1007/s11042-020-08992-6"],"references":["327416148_Semantic_Signatures_for_Urban_Visual_Localization","335845538_Are_Large-Scale_3D_Models_Really_Necessary_for_Accurate_Visual_Localization","331805255_Big_Data_Analytics_for_Large-Scale_Multimedia_Search","329743808_Learning_Less_is_More_-_6D_Camera_Localization_via_3D_Surface_Regression","324387691_YOLOv3_An_Incremental_Improvement","322059369_Focal_Loss_for_Dense_Object_Detection","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","319610560_A_Survey_on_Visual-Based_Localization_On_the_Benefit_of_Heterogeneous_Data","317297400_NetVLAD_CNN_architecture_for_weakly_supervised_place_recognition","317161158_Panorama_to_Panorama_Matching_for_Location_Recognition","316902678_Cross-domain_image_localization_by_adaptive_feature_fusion","308864003_Vehicle_localization_using_mono-camera_and_geo-referenced_traffic_signs","315928425_Are_Large-Scale_3D_Models_Really_Necessary_for_Accurate_Visual_Localization","312823476_DisLocation_Scalable_Descriptor_Distinctiveness_for_Location_Recognition","311611050_NetVLAD_CNN_architecture_for_weakly_supervised_place_recognition"]}
