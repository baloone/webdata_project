{"id":"349801696_Analysis_and_Classification_of_Strike_Rate_of_a_Cricketer_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","abstract":"Nowadays machine learning and data science, one of the most applied fields of computer science and it has \na notable impact on the game of cricket. In this paper we use various ML techniques on cricket. We use 3 \ndifferent classifiers and one clustering technique. We propose a simple ML based model that classifies data \ninto three different categories that is corresponding to three different formats of cricket. We followed data \nscience life cycle in overall this paper. We compare four ML classifiers in our paper and conclude to the \nbest result. In our data set SVM is best in terms of result and we justify this result with proper statements \nand figures. And that comparative study is unique to this paper.","authors":["Soumen Halder"],"meta":["December 2020International Journal of Information Science and Computing 7(2)","DOI:10.30954/2348-7437.2.2020.4"],"references":["309040318_A_New_Team_Selection_Methodology_using_Machine_Learning_and_Memetic_Genetic_Algorithm_for_IPL-9","298801732_A_new_Machine_Learning_based_Deep_Performance_Index_for_Ranking_IPL_T20_Cricketers","237071150_Bayes'_Theorem_in_the_21st_Century"]}
