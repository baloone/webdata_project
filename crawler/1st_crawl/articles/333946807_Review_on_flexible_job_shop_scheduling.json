{"id":"333946807_Review_on_flexible_job_shop_scheduling","abstract":"Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem, which has significant\napplications in the real world. Due to its complexity and significance, lots of attentions have been paid to tackle this problem. In\nthis study, the existing solution methods for the FJSP in recent literature are classified into exact algorithms, heuristics and\nmeta-heuristics, which are reviewed comprehensively. Moreover, the real-world applications of the FJSP are also introduced.\nFinally, the development trends of the manufacturing industry are analysed, and the future research opportunities of the FJSP\nare summarised in detail.","authors":["Xinyu Li","Jin Xie","Kunkun Peng","Haoran Li"],"meta":["June 2019IET Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing 1(2)","DOI:10.1049/iet-cim.2018.0009","Project: (flexible) job shop scheduing"],"references":["327326241_A_Comparison_between_Two_Modified_NSGA-II_Algorithms_for_Solving_the_Multi-objective_Flexible_Job_Shop_Scheduling_Problem","325829385_An_integrated_approach_for_scheduling_flexible_job-shop_using_teaching-learning-based_optimization_method","334125488_A_Review_of_the_Roles_of_Digital_Twin_in_CPS-Based_Production_Systems","330061399_Iterated_greedy_insertion_approaches_for_the_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem_with_transportation_times_constraint","328845356_Extracting_priority_rules_for_dynamic_multi-objective_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problems_using_gene_expression_programming","327827143_A_heuristic_model_for_dynamic_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem_considering_variable_processing_times","327652224_Extracting_New_Dispatching_Rules_for_Multi-objective_Dynamic_Flexible_Job_Shop_Scheduling_with_Limited_Buffer_Spaces","326167696_A_heuristic_algorithm_based_on_tabu_search_for_the_solution_of_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problems_with_lot_streaming","325294099_Analysis_of_double-resource_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem_based_on_genetic_algorithm","325081637_Multi-agent_model_based_on_combination_of_chemical_reaction_optimisation_metaheuristic_with_Tabu_search_for_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem"]}
