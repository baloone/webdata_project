{"id":"220994326_Simpler_Approximation_of_the_Maximum_Asymmetric_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","abstract":"We give a very simple approximation algorithm for the maximum asymmetric traveling salesman problem. The approximation guarantee of our algorithm is 2/3, which matches the best known approximation guarantee by Kaplan, Lewenstein, Shafrir and Sviridenko. Our algorithm is simple to analyze, and contrary to previous approaches, which need an optimal solution to a linear program, our algorithm is combinatorial and only uses maximum weight perfect matching algorithm.","authors":["Katarzyna Paluch","Khaled Elbassioni","Anke van Zuylen"],"meta":["February 2012","DOI:10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2012.501","SourceDBLP","Conference: 29th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, STACS 2012, February 29th - March 3rd, 2012, Paris, France"],"references":["226633469_A_79_-_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","226478440_3544-approximation_for_Asymmetric_Maximum_TSP_with_Triangle_Inequality","220532704_A_58_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Asymmetric_TSP","242929791_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Distances_One_and_Two","239066452_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Weight_Hamiltonian_Circuit","223678501_A_greedy_approximation_algorithm_for_constructing_shortest_common_superstrings","221498588_Long_Tours_and_Short_Superstrings_Preliminary_Version","221462624_Two_Approximation_Algorithms_for_3-Cycle_Covers","220778901_An_813-approximation_algorithm_for_the_asymmetric_maximum_TSP","220406467_An_813-approximation_algorithm_for_the_asymmetric_maximum_TSP"]}
