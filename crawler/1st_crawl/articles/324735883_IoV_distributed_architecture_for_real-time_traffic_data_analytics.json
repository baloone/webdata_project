{"id":"324735883_IoV_distributed_architecture_for_real-time_traffic_data_analytics","abstract":"In this paper, we present necessary premises for the deployment of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) integrating Big Data analytics of road network traffic measurements of the city of Mohammedia, Morocco. Thus, we introduce an architecture based on three main layers such as IoV, Fog Computing and Cloud Computing Layer. We specifically put more focus on Fog Computing layer in which we develop a framework for a real-time collecting and processing events generated by intelligent vehicles as well as visualizing traffic state on each road section. Furthermore, we consider deployment and test of the proposed framework using events retrieved from a Vanets-type micro simulation. Finally, we present and discuss the first obtained results as well as the advantages and limitations of the proposed architecture.","authors":["Mohamed Nahri","Azedine Boulmakoul","Lamia Karim","Ahmed Lbath"],"meta":["January 2018Procedia Computer Science 130:480-487","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.055","Project: Entrepôt de données spatio-temporel et acheminement stratégique du transport de marchandises dangereuses par route dans le cadre de la réglementation ADR"],"references":["315764651_A_Survey_of_Distributed_Message_Broker_Queues","315439003_A_Survey_of_Attacks_and_Detection_Mechanisms_on_Intelligent_Transportation_Systems_VANETs_and_IoV","309081880_IoT_Middleware_A_Survey_on_Issues_and_Enabling_Technologies","292869605_Social_Internet_of_Vehicles_for_Smart_Cities","277562344_Recent_Advances_in_Industrial_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Toward_Efficient_Management_in_IoT","273392846_Horizon_2020_and_Beyond_On_the_5G_Operating_System_for_a_True_Digital_Society","316807851_Road_Traffic_Congestion_A_Concise_Guide","315301387_From_LTE_to_5G_for_Connected_Mobility","310505690_RFID_Technologies_for_Internet_of_Things","305871378_Benchmarking_Streaming_Computation_Engines_Storm_Flink_and_Spark_Streaming"]}
