{"id":"313828717_Modelling_Trust_Dynamics_in_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm based on the interconnection of everyday objects. It is expected that the ‘things’ involved in the IoT paradigm will have to interact with each other, often in uncertain conditions. It is therefore of paramount importance for the success of IoT that there are mechanisms in place that help overcome the lack of certainty. Trust can help achieve this goal. In this paper, we introduce a framework that assists developers in including trust in IoT scenarios. This framework takes into account trust, privacy and identity requirements as well as other functional requirements derived from IoT scenarios to provide the different services that allow the inclusion of trust in the IoT.","authors":["Carmen Fernandez Gago","Francisco Moyano","Javier Lopez"],"meta":["February 2017Information Sciences 396","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2017.02.039"],"references":["266057891_Building_Trust_and_Reputation_In_A_Development_Framework_for_Trust_Models_Implementation","233987048_The_Social_Internet_of_Things_SIoT_-_When_social_networks_meet_the_Internet_of_Things_Concept_architecture_and_network_characterization","220302035_Privacy-aware_access_control_with_trust_management_in_web_service","220117811_TRM-IoT_A_Trust_Management_Model_Based_on_Fuzzy_Reputation_for_Internet_of_Things","3904503_Trust-adapted_enforcement_of_security_policies_in_distributedcomponent-structured_applications","3633816_Decentralized_Trust_Management","301746009_A_Model-driven_Approach_for_Engineering_Trust_and_Reputation_into_Software_Services","294288425_When_Things_Matter_A_Survey_on_Data-Centric_Internet_of_Things","288800963_Towards_Engineering_Trust-Aware_Future_Internet_Systems","281200863_Modelsruntime","278702907_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Trust_Models","262351724_Dynamic_trust_management_for_internet_of_things_applications","257455393_A_framework_for_enabling_trust_requirements_in_social_cloud_applications","236890908_Detecting_Insider_Threats_A_Trust-Aware_Framework","224224394_An_Architecture_for_Trust-Adaptive_Agents","224179285_Autonomic_Trust_Management_for_a_Component-Based_Software_System"]}
