{"id":"257212372_A_random_fixed_point_iteration_for_three_random_operators_on_uniformly_convex_Banach_spaces","abstract":"In the present paper we introduce a random iteration scheme for three random operators defined on a closed and convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space and prove its convergence to a common fixed point of three random operators. The results is also an extension of a known theorem in the corresponding non-random case.","authors":["Binayak S.
