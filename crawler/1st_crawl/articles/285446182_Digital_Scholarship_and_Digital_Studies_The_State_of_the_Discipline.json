{"id":"285446182_Digital_Scholarship_and_Digital_Studies_The_State_of_the_Discipline","abstract":"While popular imagination has “the digital” opposed to “the book,” the two are now inextricably linked. This review essay looks at the range of digital tools available for conducting book history; the importance of software studies, platform studies, critical code studies, and media archaeology for book historians; and the intertwined connections between print and digital in the production and dissemination of today’s books. The authors argue for understanding the necessities of understanding the myriad relationships between page and screen, and the abiding materiality of the digital form.","authors":["Matthew Kirschenbaum","Sarah Werner"],"meta":["January 2014Book History 17(1):406-458","DOI:10.1353/bh.2014.0005"],"references":[]}
