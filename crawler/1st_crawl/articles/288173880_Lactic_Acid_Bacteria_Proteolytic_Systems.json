{"id":"288173880_Lactic_Acid_Bacteria_Proteolytic_Systems","abstract":"Although lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are not considered as strongly proteolytic bacteria, a part of their proteolytic system has been extensively explored for the last few decades because it is essential for the optimal growth of LAB in milk. The association of a cell wall protease and of a set of peptidases has indeed proved their efficiency in providing these auxotrophic bacteria with free amino acids, allowing optimal growth to occur. However, analysis of LAB genome sequences has revealed the presence of up to 40 putative proteolytic enzymes in each bacterial species, the role of more than half of them being still unknown. The role of the proteolytic system of LAB in various functions such as regulation, maturation, and secretion of proteins, posttranslational modification, degradation of abnormal proteins, and peptidoglycan metabolism is still poorly known and remains to be understood for a better control of these bacteria of great industrial interest.","authors":["Liliana Lopez-Kleine","VÃ©ronique Monnet"],"meta":["December 2011","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-374407-4.00257-0","In book: Encyclopedia of Dairy Sciences (pp.49-55)"],"references":["226903028_The_proteolytic_systems_of_lactic_acid_bacteria","225264892_Peptidases_and_amino_acid_catabolism_in_lactic_acid_bacteria_Antonie_Van_Leeuwenhoek_761-4217-246","43432524_Multiple-Peptidase_Mutants_of_Lactococcus_lactis_Are_Severely_Impaired_in_Their_Ability_To_Grow_in_Milk","7429737_Guedon_E_Sperandio_B_Pons_N_Ehrlich_SD_Renault_P_Overall_control_of_nitrogen_metabolism_in_Lactococcus_lactis_by_CodY_and_possible_models_for_CodY_regulation_in_Firmicutes_Microbiology_151_3895-3909","7153010_Proteolytic_systems_of_lactic_acid_bacteria","265419434_Peptide_conversations_in_Gram-positive_bacteria","263259423_Flavour_forming_abilities_and_amino_acid_requirements_of_Lactococcus_lactis_strains_isolated_from_artisanal_and_non-dairy_origin","20885296_Genetics_of_the_proteolytic_system_of_lactic_acid_bacteria","12769006_Bioactive_peptides_encrypted_in_milk_proteins_Proteolytic_activation_and_thropho-functional_properties","12769002_Multi-domain_cell-envelope_proteinases_of_lactic_acid_bacteria","11090896_Glutamate_dehydrogenase_activity_A_major_criterion_for_the_selection_of_flavour-producing_lactic_acid_bacteria_strains"]}
