{"id":"8452259_Impact_of_Anthropogenic_CO2_on_the_CaCO3_System_in_the_Oceans","abstract":"Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations over the past two centuries have led to greater CO2 uptake by the oceans. This acidification process has changed the saturation state ofthe oceans with respect to calcium carbonate\n(CaCO3) particles. Here we estimate the in situ CaCO3 dissolution rates for the global oceans from total alkalinity and chlorofluorocarbon data, and we also discuss the future\nimpacts of anthropogenic CO2 on CaCO3 shell–forming species. CaCO3 dissolution rates, ranging from 0.003 to 1.2 micromoles per kilogram per year, are observed beginning near the aragonite\nsaturation horizon. The total water column CaCO3 dissolution rate for the global oceans is approximately 0.5 ± 0.2 petagrams of CaCO3-C per year, which is approximately 45 to 65% of the export production of CaCO3.","authors":["Richard Feely","Sabine Chris","Kitack Lee","Will Berelson"],"meta":["August 2004Science 305(5682):362-6","DOI:10.1126/science.1097329","SourcePubMed"],"references":["312653166_Contribution_of_working_group_to_the_fifth_assessment_report_of_the_Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change_Clouds_and_aerosols","259265068_Global_biochemical_cycle_of_boron","256649072_Global_deep-sea_burial_rate_of_calcium_carbonate_during_the_Last_Glacial_Maximum","285249999_The_global_carbon_cycle_Integrating_humans","284661321_hi_situ_calcium_carbonate_dissolution_in_the_Pacific_Ocean","264607921_Decreasing_marine_biogenic_calcification_A_negative_feedback_on_rising_atmospheric_pCO2","264576861_Production_and_Accumulation_of_Calcium_Carbonate_in_the_Ocean_Budget_of_a_Nonsteady_State","264364320_An_end_to_the_rain_ratio_reign","254276573_Postindustrial_enhancement_of_aragonite_undersaturation_in_the_upper_tropical_and_subtropical_Atlantic_Ocean_The_role_of_fossil_fuel_CO2","251427259_Ocean_chemistry_of_the_fossil_fuel_CO2_signal_The_haline_signal_of_business_as_usual"]}
