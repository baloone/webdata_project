{"id":"334782198_Stateful_Logic_Operations_in_One-Transistor-One-Resistor_Resistive_Random_Access_Memory_Array","abstract":"Nonvolatile and cascadable stateful logic operations are experimentally demonstrated within a 1k-bit one-transistor-one-resistor (1T1R) resistive random access memory (RRAM) array, where NAND gates serve as the building blocks. A robust dual-gate-voltage operation scheme is proposed. The effects of the transistor on logic operation and the robustness to device parameter variations are discussed. The parallel 4-bit bitwise XOR operation is experimentally implemented in the 1T1R array by cascading NAND gates. This work presents a feasible approach towards in-memory computing for large-scale circuits.","authors":["Wensheng Shen","Peng Huang","Mengqi Fan","Runze Han"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Electron Device Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LED.2019.2931947"],"references":["329594655_Reconfigurable_Boolean_Logic_in_Memristive_Crossbar_The_Principle_and_Implementation","327406545_Efficient_Implementation_of_Boolean_and_Full-Adder_Functions_With_1T1R_RRAMs_for_Beyond_Von_Neumann_In-Memory_Computing","326869517_Logic_Computing_with_Stateful_Neural_Networks_of_Resistive_Switches","317092002_Scouting_Logic_A_Novel_Memristor-Based_Logic_Design_for_Resistive_Computing","311959380_Functionally_Complete_Boolean_Logic_in_1T1R_Resistive_Random_Access_Memory","305780222_Repeatable_accurate_and_high_speed_multi-level_programming_of_memristor_1T1R_arrays_for_power_efficient_analog_computing_applications","325744081_In-memory_computing_with_resistive_switching_devices","322816386_A_16Mb_dual-mode_ReRAM_macro_with_sub-14ns_computing-in-memory_and_memory_functions_enabled_by_self-write_termination_scheme","317726417_Uniformity_improvements_of_low_current_1T1R_RRAM_arrays_through_optimized_verification_strategy","308609017_Reconfigurable_Nonvolatile_Logic_Operations_in_Resistance_Switching_Crossbar_Array_for_Large-Scale_Circuits"]}
