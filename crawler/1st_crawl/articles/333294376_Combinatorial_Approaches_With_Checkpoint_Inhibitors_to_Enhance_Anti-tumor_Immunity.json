{"id":"333294376_Combinatorial_Approaches_With_Checkpoint_Inhibitors_to_Enhance_Anti-tumor_Immunity","abstract":"Treatment of cancer patients has been recently revolutionized by the application of various immunotherapeutics. However, the response rates are still limited ranging between approximately 20 and 40% suggesting that combinations of immunotherapy with conventional treatment, like chemotherapy, radiation, epigenetic modulators, targeted therapies using small molecules as well as other (immuno) therapeutics, might be an option to increase systemic anti-tumor immunity. It is postulated that different non-immune based therapies in combination with immunotherapies could reprogram the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and enhance the immunogenicity of tumor cells leading to an improved therapeutic efficacy and a better patients' outcome. Despite there exist various examples of increased objective responses achieved by adding these different therapies to immunotherapies, strategies for rational and evidence-based design of checkpoint inhibitor combinations to maximize the clinical benefit for patients are urgently required. Therefore, the main purpose of this review is to summarize recent results obtained from experimental models and clinical trials to enhance tumor immunogenicity by combining immunotherapy with other therapeutic options to maximize patients' outcome and minimize adverse events.","authors":["Barbara Seliger"],"meta":["May 2019Frontiers in Immunology 10","DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00999"],"references":["327183050_Immuno-Oncology_Emerging_Targets_and_Combination_Therapies","324726618_The_combination_of_anti-KIR_monoclonal_antibodies_with_anti-PD-IPD-LI_monoclonal_antibodies_could_be_a_critical_breakthrough_in_overcoming_tumor_immune_escape_in_NSCLC","324469617_T_cell-induced_CSF1_promotes_melanoma_resistance_to_PD1_blockade","323743263_The_CDK46_Inhibitor_Abemaciclib_Induces_a_T_Cell_Inflamed_Tumor_Microenvironment_and_Enhances_the_Efficacy_of_PD-L1_Checkpoint_Blockade","323581157_Enhancing_cancer_immunotherapy_using_antiangiogenics_Opportunities_and_challenges","323495532_Overcoming_Barriers_of_Age_to_Enhance_Efficacy_of_Cancer_Immunotherapy_The_Clout_of_the_Extracellular_Matrix","325902539_The_reciprocal_function_and_regulation_of_tumor_vessels_and_immune_cells_offers_new_therapeutic_opportunities_in_cancer","325566785_PD-1_Blockade_with_Cemiplimab_in_Advanced_Cutaneous_Squamous-Cell_Carcinoma","324552563_Pembrolizumab_plus_Chemotherapy_in_Metastatic_Non-Small-Cell_Lung_Cancer","323657640_Combination_immunotherapies_implementing_adoptive_T-cell_transfer_for_advanced-stage_melanoma"]}
