{"id":"201381807_Business_Simulation_Games_Current_Usage_Levels--An_Update","abstract":"A major survey involving more than 1,500 mail questionnaires was administered just over 10 years ago to determine the extent of business simulation game usage in academia and in business training programs. This article updates the earlier study through a mailing of 1,583 questionnaires to business school deans, business faculty, and training and development managers in industry. The findings from this study show that business simulation game usage in academia and in industry has continued to grow over the past 10 years with expectations for further growth.","authors":["A. J.
