{"id":"288889802_Linear_Convergence_of_Proximal_Gradient_Algorithm_with_Extrapolation_for_a_Class_of_Nonconvex_Nonsmooth_Minimization_Problems","abstract":"In this paper, we study the proximal gradient algorithm with extrapolation\nfor minimizing the sum of a Lipschitz differentiable function and a proper\nclosed convex function. Under the error bound condition used in [19] for\nanalyzing the convergence of the proximal gradient algorithm, we show that\nthere exists a threshold such that if the extrapolation coefficients are chosen\nbelow this threshold, then the sequence generated converges $R$-linearly to a\nstationary point of the problem. Moreover, the corresponding sequence of\nobjective values is also $R$-linearly convergent. In addition, the threshold\nreduces to $1$ for convex problems and, as a consequence, we obtain the\n$R$-linear convergence of the sequence generated by the FISTA with the fixed\nrestart. Finally, again for convex problems, we show that the successive\nchanges of the iterates vanish for many choices of sequences of extrapolation\ncoefficients that approach the threshold. In particular, this conclusion can be\nshown to hold for the sequence generated by the FISTA.","authors":["Bo Wen","Xiaojun Chen","Ting Kei Pong"],"meta":["December 2015SIAM Journal on Optimization 27(1)","DOI:10.1137/16M1055323","SourcearXiv"],"references":["287251079_A_Unified_Approach_to_Error_Bounds_for_Structured_Convex_Optimization_Problems","279864547_Fast_inertial_dynamics_and_FISTA_algorithms_in_convex_optimization_Perturbation_aspects","272195537_A_Lyapunov_Analysis_of_FISTA_with_Local_Linear_Convergence_for_Sparse_Optimization","314891321_Dual_Extrapolation_and_its_Applications_for_Solving_Variational_Inequalities_and_Related_Problems'","279272290_Portfolio_Selection","278282637_An_algorithm_for_total_variation_minimization_and_applications","276459455_On_the_Convergence_of_the_Iterates_of_the_Fast_Iterative_ShrinkageThresholding_Algorithm","270906517_Local_linear_convergence_of_ISTA_and_FISTA_on_the_LASSO_problem","257480024_Sparse_solutions_to_random_standard_quadratic_optimization_problems","257291640_A_method_of_solving_a_convex_programming_problem_with_convergence_rate_O1k2"]}
