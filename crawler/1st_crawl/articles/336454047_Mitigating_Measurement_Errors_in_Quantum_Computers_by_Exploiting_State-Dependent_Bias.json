{"id":"336454047_Mitigating_Measurement_Errors_in_Quantum_Computers_by_Exploiting_State-Dependent_Bias","abstract":"Quantum computers are susceptible to errors. While quantum computers can be guarded against errors using error correction codes, near-term quantum computers will not have sufficient number of qubits to implement error correction and must perform their computation in the presence of errors. Qubit measurement is typically the most error-prone operation on a quantum computer, with measurement errors ranging from 8% to 30% reported on current machines. This goal of this paper is to mitigate measurement errors by exploiting the state-dependent bias of measurement errors.\nExperiments on the IBM-Q5 and IBM-Q14 machines show variation in measurement errors depending on the state being measured. For example, measuring an all-zero state on IBM-Q5 has a fidelity of 84%; however, the fidelity drops to 62% while measuring the all-one state. To improve measurement fidelity, we propose Invert-and-Measure, which transforms the system from a vulnerable state to a stronger state and then performs the measurement in the stronger state. We propose two designs for Invert-and-Measure. First, Static Invert-and-Measure (SIM), which executes two instances of the program, one with standard measurements and the other with inverted measurements and combines the results. Second, Adaptive Invert and Measure (AIM), which learns the relative bias of different states using runtime profiling and produces specialized inversions to increase the likelihood of obtaining the correct answer. Our evaluations, using IBM-Q5 and IBM-Q14, show that SIM improves the application reliability by up to 2X, and AIM by up to 3X.","authors":["Swamit Tannu","Moinuddin K.
