A set of sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence and the exponential stability of pseudo almost periodic solutions for this class of neural networks by applying Banach's fixed point theorems, and differential inequality techniques. Finally, we present a numerical example and simulation to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. We extend and improve previously know results.","authors":["Chaouki Aouiti","Imen Ben Gharbia","Jinde Cao","Mohammed Salah M'hamdi"],"meta":["February 2018Chaos Solitons & Fractals 107:111-127","DOI:10.1016/j.chaos.2017.12.022"],"references":["307613765_Neutral_impulsive_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_coefficients_and_leakage_delays","306324493_Piecewise_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solution_for_Impulsive_Generalised_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_Leakage_Delays","271562104_Stability_Criterion_for_BAM_Neural_Networks_of_Neutral-Type_with_Interval_Time-Varying_Delays","257591152_Global_exponential_stability_for_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays_in_the_leakage_terms","312921274_Fixed-time_synchronization_of_delayed_memristor-based_recurrent_neural_networks","294276218_Stabilization_of_Delay_Systems_Delay-Dependent_Impulsive_Control","273278913_Pseudo_almost_periodic_solutions_for_CNNs_with_leakage_delays_and_complex_deviating_arguments","268882337_Design_of_state_estimator_bidirectional_associative_memory_neural_network_with_leakage_delays","260213358_Robust_state_estimation_for_discrete-time_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delay","256710845_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_a_periodic_solution_for_a_discrete-time_interval_general_BAM_neural_networks","243258345_An_analysis_of_periodic_solutions_of_bi-directional_associative_memory_networks_with_time-varying_delays","243013665_Leakage_delays_in_BAM","232408627_New_robust_passivity_criteria_for_stochastic_fuzzy_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays","229228157_Global_attractive_periodic_solutions_of_BAM_neural_networks_with_continuously_distributed_delays_in_the_leakage_terms","223121454_Existence_and_stability_of_periodic_solution_for_BAM_neural_networks_with_distributed_delays","222271370_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_almost_periodic_solution_for_Cohen-Grossberg_BAM_neural_networks_with_variable_coefficients","222224959_Existence_and_stability_of_positiveperiodic_solution_for_BAM_neural_networks_with_delays","222140545_Global_asymptotic_stability_of_BAM_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays_and_impulses","220559149_Exponential_stability_for_stochastic_BAM_networks_with_discrete_and_distributed_delays","220552246_Global_exponential_stability_of_BAM_neural_networks_with_recent-history_distributed_delays_and_impulse","220551532_Variable-time_impulses_in_BAM_neural_networks_with_delays","220529785_The_design_of_beta_basis_function_neural_network_and_beta_fuzzy_systems_by_a_hierarchical_genetic_algorithm","51584319_Global_asymptotic_stability_to_a_generalized_Cohen-Grossberg_BAM_neural_networks_of_neutral_type_delays","50289027_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_a_periodic_solution_to_interval_general_Bidirectional_Associative_Memory_BAM_neural_networks_with_multiple_delays_on_time_scales"]}
