{"id":"355190211_Deploying_and_scaling_distributed_parallel_deep_neural_networks_on_the_Tianhe-3_prototype_system","abstract":"Due to the increase in computing power, it is possible to improve the feature extraction and data fitting capabilities of DNN networks by increasing their depth and model complexity. However, the big data and complex models greatly increase the training overhead of DNN, so accelerating their training process becomes a key task. The Tianhe-3 peak speed is designed to target E-class, and the huge computing power provides a potential opportunity for DNN training. We implement and extend LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet model training for a single MT-2000+ and FT-2000+ compute nodes, as well as extended multi-node clusters, and propose an improved gradient synchronization process for Dynamic Allreduce communication optimization strategy for the gradient synchronization process base on the ARM architecture features of the Tianhe-3 prototype, providing experimental data and theoretical basis for further enhancing and improving the performance of the Tianhe-3 prototype in large-scale distributed training of neural networks.","authors":["Jia Wei","Xingjun Zhang","Zeyu Ji","Jingbo Li"],"meta":["October 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):20244","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-98794-z"],"references":["329061302_swCaffe_A_Parallel_Framework_for_Accelerating_Deep_Learning_Applications_on_Sunway_TaihuLight","315667264_Efficient_Processing_of_Deep_Neural_Networks_A_Tutorial_and_Survey","343047983_Testing_high_performance_numerical_simulation_programs_experience_lessons_learned_and_open_issues","342684753_OHTMA_an_optimized_heuristic_topology-aware_mapping_algorithm_on_the_Tianhe-3_exascale_supercomputer_prototype","333225692_Performance_Evaluation_and_Analysis_of_Linear_Algebra_Kernels_in_the_Prototype_Tianhe-3_Cluster","323157370_High-Scalable_Collaborated_Parallel_Framework_for_Large-Scale_Molecular_Dynamic_Simulation_on_Tianhe-2_Supercomputer","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","314899748_Adaptation_of_Deep_Belief_Networks_to_Modern_Multicore_Architectures","314012773_Scalable_training_of_3D_convolutional_networks_on_multi-_and_many-cores","313262896_Improving_the_Performance_of_OpenCL-based_FPGA_Accelerator_for_Convolutional_Neural_Network","313014576_S-Caffe_Co-designing_MPI_Runtimes_and_Caffe_for_Scalable_Deep_Learning_on_Modern_GPU_Clusters","312964242_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_and_Deep_Belief_Networks_on_Sunway_Cluster","312890808_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_skin_cancer_with_deep_neural_networks","311488529_Throughput-Optimized_OpenCL-based_FPGA_Accelerator_for_Large-Scale_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","308834128_Optimized_deep_belief_networks_on_CUDA_GPUs"]}
