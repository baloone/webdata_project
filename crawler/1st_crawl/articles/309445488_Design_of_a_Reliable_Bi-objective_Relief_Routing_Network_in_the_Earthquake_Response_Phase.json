{"id":"309445488_Design_of_a_Reliable_Bi-objective_Relief_Routing_Network_in_the_Earthquake_Response_Phase","abstract":"One of the most critical issues in areas which have recently faced natural disasters is transportation of both injured people to medical centers and relief commodities to their desired destinations. In such situation, due to disruptions, some routes may lose all or part of their capacities and not be able to accept as much vehicles as before. Consequently, the relief vehicles face difficulties to follow their itinerary. Such critical circumstance calls for finding reliable solutions. This study develops a new bi-objective, multi-mode and multi-commodity model, in which the reliability is taken into account to help managers in making more reliable decisions. To solve this model, the TH method is used in order to find the equivalent single objective model and this new model is exactly solved by coding in GAMS software.","authors":["Reza Tavakkoli-Moghaddam","Shadab Shishegar","A.
