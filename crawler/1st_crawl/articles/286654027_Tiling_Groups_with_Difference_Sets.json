{"id":"286654027_Tiling_Groups_with_Difference_Sets","abstract":"We study tilings of groups with mutually disjoint difference sets. Some necessary existence conditions are proved and shown not to be sufficient. In the case of tilings with two difference sets we show the equivalence to skew Hadamard difference sets, and prove that they must be normalized if the group is abelian. Furthermore, we present some constructions of tilings based on cyclotomy and investigate tilings consisting of Singer difference sets.","authors":["Ante Custic","Vedran Krcadinac","Yue Zhou"],"meta":["June 2015The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 22(2)","DOI:10.37236/5157"],"references":["329786663_Difference_sets","261380000_Rendezvous_sequence_construction_in_Cognitive_Radio_Ad-Hoc_networks_based_on_difference_sets","318623005_Finite_Geometry_and_Character_Theory","315217532_A_characteristic_property_of_quadratic_residues","284670843_Difference_sets","267476237_The_existence_of_v4l_disjoint_difference_families","265448517_Some_New_Difference_Sets","243002466_Antisymmetric_difference_sets","242997563_Block_disjoint_difference_families_for_Steiner_triple_systems","239744948_A_Characteristic_Property_of_Quadratic_Residues"]}
