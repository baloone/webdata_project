{"id":"345782538_Visual_and_Artistic_Effects_of_an_IoT_System_in_Smart_Cities_Research_Flow","abstract":"In smart cities, the progress of technology has allowed the implementation of sensors, originating the Internet of Things (IoT) and making cities safer and more sustainable. Hence, the presence of elements that generate visual and artistic effects of IoT technology can make a great contribution to the provision of information that the urbanite needs. The aim of this study is to analyze worldwide research on the visual and artistic effects of IoT in smart cities. Bibliometric techniques were utilized on 1278 articles on this subject matter for the period of 2010–2019 to achieve results on activity production. This has increased yearly, where in the last triennium, it has accumulated 85.21% of documents. Computer science and engineering were the most prominent subject areas where the articles were classified. The lines of research in the development of this research topic have been detected. Furthermore, the main directions for future research have also been identified. This study aims to contribute to highlighting the drivers of this field of research, in addition to providing the available information and future directions to improve academic and scientific discussion.","authors":["Mariana-Daniela González-Zamar","Emilio Abad-Segura"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.3390/iot1020011"],"references":["343394338_IoT_Technology_Applications-Based_Smart_Cities_Research_Analysis","342603757_The_key_factors_in_transforming_Birjand_city_to_a_smart_city_smart_mobility_smart_government","342288855_Socioeconomic_Effects_in_Cyberbullying_Global_Research_Trends_in_the_Educational_Context","341908423_Comparison_Of_IoT_Architectures_Using_A_Smart_City_Benchmark","341455504_Sustainability_of_Educational_Technologies_An_Approach_to_Augmented_Reality_Research","341389947_Surface_Display_Technology_for_Biosensor_Applications_A_Review","340699379_Global_Research_Trends_in_Financial_Transactions","343133003_Performance_evaluation_of_hybrid_crowdsensing_systems_with_stateful_CrowdSenSim_20_simulator","341228665_Reliability_in_Internet_of_Things_Current_Status_and_Future_Perspectives","341066568_The_Perception_of_-A_Smart_City_In_Terms_of_Cognitive_Interpretation_on_the_Example_of_the_Notion_and_Image_of_-A_Smart_City_among_Students_Future_Architects","339995993_The_Internet_of_Things_for_Smart_Environments","340697744_Transformation_of_Management_Technologies_in_the_Digital_Economy","340668107_IoT_based_Smart_City_Bin","340581298_Architecting_Smart_City_Digital_Twins_Combined_Semantic_Model_and_Machine_Learning_Approach","340524610_Covid-19_Trump_threatens_to_stop_funding_WHO_amid_China-centric_claims"]}
