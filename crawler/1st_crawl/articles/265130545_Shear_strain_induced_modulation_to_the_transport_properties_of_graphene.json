{"id":"265130545_Shear_strain_induced_modulation_to_the_transport_properties_of_graphene","abstract":"Applying shear strain has been considered as a hopeful method to open a band gap of graphene. To study the transport properties of graphene under shear strain, a device was fabricated to apply shear strain, up to 16.7%, to graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition method. A top gate with ionic liquid as the dielectric material was used to tune the carrier density. The conductance of the Dirac point and carrier mobility is found to increase with a comparatively small increasing strain but then decrease with a larger one. Such a behavior might be related to several factors: the wrinkles, the transverse conducting channels, and the grain boundaries of graphene. Our study is helpful to further understand the strain engineering in graphene.","authors":["Xin He","Li Gao","Ning Tang","Junxi Duan"],"meta":["August 2014Applied Physics Letters 105(8):083108-083108-4","DOI:10.1063/1.4894082"],"references":["247652665_Strained_Si_SiGe_and_Ge_channels_for_high-mobility_metal-oxide-semiconductor_field-effect_transistors","230680190_Strain_dependent_resistance_in_chemical_vapor_deposition_grown_graphene","51558329_Accessing_the_transport_properties_of_graphene_and_its_multi-layers_at_high_carrier_density","51410262_Measurement_of_the_Elastic_Properties_and_Intrinsic_Strength_of_Monolayer_Graphene","45922854_Gap_opening_in_graphene_by_shear_strain","41429080_Graphene_nanomesh","26721506_Strain_Engineering_of_Graphene's_Electronic_Structure","24409767_Large-Area_Synthesis_of_High-Quality_and_Uniform_Graphene_Films_on_Copper_Foils","23421149_Tight-binding_approach_to_uniaxial_strain_in_graphene","23154574_Approaching_ballistic_transport_in_suspended_graphene","5953384_Intrinsic_ripples_in_graphene","5568388_Superior_Thermal_Conductivity_of_Single-Layer_Graphene","1763893_The_electronic_properties_of_graphene","277369563_Nanotube_Molecular_Wires_as_Chemical_Sensors","257955379_Fabrication_of_stretchable_MoS2_thin-film_transistors_using_elastic_ion-gel_gate_dielectrics","257578345_Effect_of_lateral_strain_on_gate_induced_control_of_electrical_conduction_in_single_layer_graphene_device","243311658_Raman_Spectroscopy_in_Graphene","221822848_Strain-Induced_Conductance_Modulation_in_Graphene_Grain_Boundary","221776851_Large-Scale_Graphene_Micropatterns_via_Self-Assembly-Mediated_Process_for_Flexible_Device_Application","51698039_Stretchable_Graphene_Transistors_with_Printed_Dielectrics_and_Gate_Electrodes","47674991_Hysteresis_of_Electronic_Transport_in_Graphene_Transistors","45638800_High-Performance_Flexible_Graphene_Field_Effect_Transistors_with_Ion_Gel_Gate_Dielectrics","40832942_Wafer-Scale_Synthesis_and_Transfer_of_Graphene_Films","26336230_Electrochemical_Gate-Controlled_Charge_Transport_in_Graphene_in_Ionic_Liquid_and_Aqueous_Solution","23789289_Kim_K_S_Zhao_Y_Jang_H_Lee_S_Y_Kim_J_M_Ahn_J_H_Kim_P_Choi_J_Y_Hong_B_H_Large-scale_pattern_growth_of_graphene_films_for_stretchable_transparent_electrodes_Nature_457_706-710","8218170_Electric_Field_Effect_in_Atomically_Thin_Carbon_Films","6161091_Energy_Band-Gap_Engineering_of_Graphene_Nanoribbons"]}
