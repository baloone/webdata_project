{"id":"257914138_Extension_of_the_hierarchy_for_k-OBDDs_of_small_width","abstract":"In this paper we explore the well-known k-OBDD model of branching programs. We develop a method of representation of the k-OBDD computation process as an “automata-communication protocol” computation process. Our method allows us to extend the hierarchy proved by Bolling-Sauerhoff-Sieling-Wegener in 1996 for k-OBDDs. Moreover, using the PJM function (a modification of well-known PJ and ISA functions), we prove a new hierarchy.","authors":["Farid Ablayev","Kamil Khadiev"],"meta":["March 2013Russian Mathematics 57(3)","DOI:10.3103/S1066369X13030067","Project: Exploring power of Branching Programs"],"references":["238198448_Branching_Programs_and_Binary_Decision_Diagrams-Theory_and_Applications","222485510_Hierarchy_theorems_for_kOBDDs_and_kIBDDs","221590157_Rounds_in_Communication_Complexity_Revisited"]}
