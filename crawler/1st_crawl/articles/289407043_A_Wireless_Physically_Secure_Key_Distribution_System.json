{"id":"289407043_A_Wireless_Physically_Secure_Key_Distribution_System","abstract":"A secure key distribution protocol protected by light's noise was introduced\nin 2003 [Phys. Rev. A 68, 052307 (2003)]. That protocol utilized the shot noise\nof light present in the optical channel (eg., an optical fiber) to restrict\ninformation leaks to an adversary. An initial shared information between the\nlegitimate users allowed them to extract more information from the channel than\nthe one obtained by the adversary. That original paper recognized the need for\na privacy amplification step but no specific protocol was presented. More\nrecently that original idea was improved with a specific privacy amplification\nprotocol [arXiv:1406.1543v2 [cs.CR] 8 Jul 2015] while keeping the use of an\noptical communication channel. This work merges main ideas of the protection\ngiven by the light's noise in a protocol applied to wireless channels. The use\nof a wireless channels together with recorded physical noise was introduced\nfrom 2005 to 2007 (see eg, arXiv:quant-ph/0510011 v2 16 Nov 2005 and\narXiv:0705.2243v2 [quant-ph] 17 May 2007). This work improves those embrionary\nideas of wireless channels secured by recorded optical noise. The need for\nspecific optical channels is eliminated with the wireless variation and opens\nup the possibility to apply the technique to mobile devices. This work\nintroduces this new scheme and calculates the associated security level.","authors":["Geraldo Barbosa"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Information Security and Cryptography (Enigma) 3(1)","DOI:10.17648/enig.v3i1.56","SourcearXiv"],"references":["3078866_Generalized_Privacy_Amplification"]}
