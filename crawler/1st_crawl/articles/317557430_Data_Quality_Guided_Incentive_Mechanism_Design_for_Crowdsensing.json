{"id":"317557430_Data_Quality_Guided_Incentive_Mechanism_Design_for_Crowdsensing","abstract":"In crowdsensing, appropriate rewards are always expected to compensate the participants for their consumptions of physical resources and involvements of manual efforts. While continuous low quality sensing data could do harm to the availability and preciseness of crowdsensing based services, few existing incentive mechanisms have ever addressed the issue of data quality. The design of quality based incentive mechanism is motivated by its potential to avoid inefficient sensing and unnecessary rewards. In this paper, we incorporate the consideration of data quality into the design of incentive mechanism for crowdsensing, and propose to pay the participants as how well they do, to motivate the rational participants to efficiently perform crowdsensing tasks. This mechanism estimates the quality of sensing data, and offers each participant a reward based on her effective contribution. We also implement the mechanism and evaluate its improvement in terms of quality of service and profit of service provider. The evaluation results show that our mechanism achieves superior performance when compared to general data collection model and uniform pricing scheme.","authors":["Dan Peng","Fan wu","Guihai Chen"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMC.2017.2714668"],"references":["309120602_Spectral_methods_meet_EM_A_provably_optimal_algorithm_for_crowdsourcing","308871650_Revealing_characterizing_and_detecting_crowdsourcing_spammers_A_case_study_in_community_QA","284733170_Crowdsourcing_from_Scratch_A_Pragmatic_Experiment_in_Data_Collection_by_Novice_Requesters","283815983_Improving_the_performance_of_mobile_phone_crowdsourcing_applications","281109983_Modeling_Temporal_Crowd_Work_Quality_with_Limited_Supervision","272844866_Incentive_Mechanisms_for_Participatory_Sensing_Survey_and_Research_Challenges","269298265_Profit-maximizing_incentive_for_participatory_sensing","262355504_ParkSense_a_smartphone_based_sensing_system_for_on-street_parking","260298533_Quality-based_Pricing_for_Crowdsourced_Workers","254464487_Crowdsourcing_to_smartphones_Incentive_mechanism_design_for_mobile_phone_sensing","233091068_Monetary_incentives_in_participatory_sensing_using_multi-attributive_auctions","228613934_Participatory_Sensing","221568696_Examining_Micro-Payments_for_Participatory_Sensing_Data_Collections","221015855_Recruitment_Framework_for_Participatory_Sensing_Data_Collections","220926585_Surround-Sense_Mobile_Phone_Localization_via_Ambience_Fingerprinting","220701427_NoiseTube_Measuring_and_mapping_noise_pollution_with_mobile_phones","220483400_The_Labor_Economics_of_Paid_Crowdsourcing","324371947_Mathematical_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis","308867045_Incentivize_crowd_labeling_under_budget_constraint","308845738_Providing_long-term_participation_incentive_in_participatory_sensing","308819681_Truthful_online_double_auctions_for_dynamic_mobile_crowdsourcing","273957275_Distributed_Time-Sensitive_Task_Selection_in_Mobile_Crowdsensing","271770104_Steered_crowdsensing_Incentive_design_towards_quality-oriented_place-centric_crowdsensing","269298309_Trac_Truthful_Auction_for_Location-Aware_Collaborative_Sensing_in_Mobile_Crowdsourcing","269298257_How_to_crowdsource_tasks_truthfully_without_sacrificing_utility_Online_incentive_mechanisms_with_budget_constraint","262202312_A_comparison_of_social_learning_and_financial_strategies_on_crowd_engagement_and_output_quality","261060371_Optimal_Incentive-driven_Design_of_Participatory_Sensing_Systems","254464327_Zee_zero-effort_crowdsourcing_for_indoor_localization","248035707_The_Three_Sigma_Rule","243705404_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Observer_Error-Rates_Using_the_EM_Algorithm","241770553_How_Long_to_Wait_Predicting_Bus_Arrival_Time_With_Mobile_Phone_Based_Participatory_Sensing","239917410_TrafficSense_Rich_Monitoring_of_Road_and_Traffic_Conditions_using_Mobile_Smartphones","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","228108105_A_value_for_n-person_games","220144587_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing_Current_State_and_Future_Challenges","51930352_Reputation-based_Incentive_Protocols_in_Crowdsourcing_Applications","38358932_On_the_Convergence_Properties_of_the_EM_Algorithm"]}
