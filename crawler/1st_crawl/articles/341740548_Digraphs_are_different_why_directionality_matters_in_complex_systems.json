{"id":"341740548_Digraphs_are_different_why_directionality_matters_in_complex_systems","abstract":"Many networks describing complex systems are directed: the interactions between elements are not symmetric. Recent work has shown that these networks can display properties such as trophic coherence or non-normality , which in turn affect stability, percolation and other dynamical features. I show here that these topological properties have a common origin, in that the edges of directed networks can be aligned—or not—with a global direction. And I illustrate how this can lead to rich and unexpected dynamical behaviour even in the simplest of models.","authors":["Samuel Johnson"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Physics Complexity 1(1):015003","DOI:10.1088/2632-072X/ab8e2f"],"references":["344732929_How_directed_is_a_directed_network","339795141_Organisational_Social_Influence_on_Directed_Hierarchical_Graphs_from_Tyranny_to_Anarchy","329624856_Structure_and_dynamical_behavior_of_non-normal_networks","322902648_Resolution_of_ranking_hierarchies_in_directed_networks","321782505_Dynamic_patterns_of_information_flow_in_complex_networks","308107428_The_Origin_of_Motif_Families_in_Food_Webs","341686421_Spectra_and_Pseudospectra_The_Behavior_of_Nonnormal_Matrices_and_Operators","317005110_Looplessness_in_networks_is_linked_to_trophic_coherence","301842630_Intervality_and_coherence_in_complex_networks","301841411_From_neurons_to_epidemics_How_trophic_coherence_affects_spreading_processes"]}
