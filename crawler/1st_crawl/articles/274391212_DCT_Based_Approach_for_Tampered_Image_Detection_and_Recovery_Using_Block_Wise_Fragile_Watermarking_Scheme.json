{"id":"274391212_DCT_Based_Approach_for_Tampered_Image_Detection_and_Recovery_Using_Block_Wise_Fragile_Watermarking_Scheme","abstract":"This paper proposes a self- embedding block wise fragile watermarking scheme with tamper detection and content recovery capability. The proposed scheme embeds the shuffled extensive ten bit Recovery data and two bit Authentication data of the image block into the least significant bits (LSB) of its corresponding mapping block.The integrity of a test block is decided by comparing 2Ã—2 non overlapping block of the test block with its corresponding mapping block. Experimental results show that the suggested scheme outperforms conventional self-recovery fragile watermarking algorithms in alteration detection as well as in tamper recovery of the image.","authors":["Shivendra Shivani","Durgesh Singh","Agarwal S."],"meta":["June 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38628-2_76","Conference: 6th Iberian Conference, IbPRIA 2013, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, June 5-7, 2013."],"references":["251493206_Semi_Fragile_Watermark_With_Self_Authentication_And_Self_Recovery","224354959_Fragile_Watermarking_With_Error-Free_Restoration_Capability","220846457_An_effective_pixel-wise_fragile_watermarking_scheme_based_on_ARA_bits","220663892_Self-embedding_watermark_with_flexible_restoration_quality","224397521_Block-wise_Fragile_Watermarking_Scheme_Based_on_Scramble_Encryption","221580317_A_Content-Based_Fragile_Watermarking_Scheme_for_Image_Authentication","220722194_Self-recovery_Fragile_Watermarking_Using_Block-Neighborhood_Tampering_Characterization"]}
