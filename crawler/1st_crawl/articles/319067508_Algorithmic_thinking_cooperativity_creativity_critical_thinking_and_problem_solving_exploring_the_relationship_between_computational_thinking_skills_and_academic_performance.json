Yet its relationship to academic performance is poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the association between computational thinking and academic performance. We test a structural model—employing a partial least squares approach—to assess the relationship between computational thinking skills and academic performance. Surprisingly, we find no association between computational thinking skills and academic performance (except for a link between cooperativity and academic performance). These results are discussed respecting curricular mandated instruction in higher-order thinking skills and the importance of curricular alignment between instructional objectives and evaluation approaches for successfully teaching and learning twenty-first-century skills.","authors":["Tenzin Doleck","Paul Bazelais","David Lemay","Anoop Saxena"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Computers in Education","DOI:10.1007/s40692-017-0090-9"],"references":["316447449_Assessing_Computational_Thinking_Across_the_Curriculum","315636456_Computational_thinking_for_teacher_education","315514475_Computational_Thinking_in_Education_Where_does_it_Fit_A_systematic_literary_review","314783552_The_Influence_of_Game-based_Programming_Education_on_the_Algorithmic_Thinking","313693781_How_does_grit_impact_college_students'_academic_achievement_in_science","309284476_A_case_study_on_cooperative_problem_solving_processes_in_small_9th_grade_student_groups","318494467_Explaining_Creativity_The_Science_of_Human_Innovation","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","312334690_Computational_thinking_is_critical_thinking_Connecting_to_university_discourse_goals_and_learning_outcomes","312253565_A_validity_and_reliability_study_of_the_Computational_Thinking_Scales_CTS"]}
