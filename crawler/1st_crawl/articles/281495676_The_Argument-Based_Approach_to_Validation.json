{"id":"281495676_The_Argument-Based_Approach_to_Validation","abstract":"Under the argument-based approach to validity, test-score interpretations and uses that are clearly stated and are supported by appropriate evidence are considered to be valid. Conversely, interpretations or uses that are not well defined or that involve doubtful inferences or assumptions are not considered valid. The proposed interpretation and use of test scores are specified in terms of a network of inferences and assumptions (or an argument) leading from a test taker's observed performances to score-based conclusions and decisions for the test taker. The validity of the proposed interpretation and use can then be evaluated in terms of the completeness and coherence of the network and the plausibility of its inferences and assumptions.","authors":["Michael Kane"],"meta":["December 2013School Psychology Review 42(4):448-457","DOI:10.1080/02796015.2013.12087465"],"references":["292742241_Scaling_and_norming","284848633_Validity_on_parole_How_can_we_go_straight","271767508_Construct_Validity_in_Psychological_Test","270585279_Generalizability_Theory","270335317_Evaluating_Test_Validity","246199998_Five_perspectives_on_validity_argument","232433556_The_standard_problem_Meaning_and_values_in_measurement_and_evaluation"]}
