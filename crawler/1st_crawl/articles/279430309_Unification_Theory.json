{"id":"279430309_Unification_Theory","abstract":"This is the final version of a chapter on unification theory that has appeared in the Handbook of Automated Reasoning. The chapter is not intended to give a complete coverage of all the results. Instead we tried to cover a number of significant topics in more detail. This should give the reader a feeling for unification research and its methodology, provide the most important references, and enable the reader to study recent research papers on the topic.","authors":["Franz Baader","Wayne Snyder","Paliath Narendran","Manfred Schmidt-Schauss"],"meta":["December 2001","DOI:10.1016/B978-044450813-3/50010-2","In book: Handbook of Automated Reasoning (pp.445-533)"],"references":["284878310_Rewrite_systems_handbook_of_theoretical_computer_science","284778807_First-order_unification_in_an_equational_theory","284618530_Une_borne_pour_les_generateurs_des_solutions_entieres_positives_d'une_equation_diophantienne_lineaire","262406858_Combination_of_constraint_solvers_for_free_and_quasi-free_structures","256181584_An_algorithm_to_generate_the_basis_of_solutions_to_homogeneous_linear_diophantine_equations","255672873_The_Undecidability_of_the_DA-Unification_Problem","248591202_Abelian_group_unification_algorithms_for_elementary_terms","243764858_Finiteness_of_the_odd_perfect_and_primitive_abundant_numbers_with_n_distinct_prime_factors","242923098_Positive_First-Order_Logic_Is_NP-Complete","242804354_Order-sorted_unification1"]}
