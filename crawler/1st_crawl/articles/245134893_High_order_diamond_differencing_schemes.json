{"id":"245134893_High_order_diamond_differencing_schemes","abstract":"We present a generalization if the diamond differencing scheme to high-order spatial orders in one- and two-dimensional Cartesian geometries. Unlike existing variable-order nodal schemes our approach reduces to the conventional low-order diamond differencing scheme in the linear case and feature super convergence characteristics at all orders. This approach is demonstrated on one- and two-dimensional benchmark problems and is compared to spherical harmonics reference solutions.","authors":["Alain HÃ©bert"],"meta":["November 2006Annals of Nuclear Energy 33(17):1479-1488","DOI:10.1016/j.anucene.2006.10.003"],"references":["267254776_French_Calculation_Schemes_for_Light_Water_Reactor_Analysis","280686489_The_Search_for_Superconvergence_in_Spherical_Harmonics_Approximations","256564415_Development_of_the_nodal_collocation_method_for_solving_the_neutron_diffusion_equation","245134234_Application_of_a_dual_variational_formulation_to_finite_element_reactor_calculations","236396225_Nodal_methods_for_discrete-ordinates_transport_problems_in_xy_geometry"]}
