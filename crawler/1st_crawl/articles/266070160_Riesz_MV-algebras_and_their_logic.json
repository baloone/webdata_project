{"id":"266070160_Riesz_MV-algebras_and_their_logic","abstract":"We develop the general theory of RMV-algebras, which are essentially unit intervals in Riesz spaces with strong unit. Since the variety of RMV-algebras is generated by [0,1], we get an equational characterization of the real product on [0,1] interpreted as scalar multiplication.","authors":["Antonio di Nola","Ioana Leustean"],"meta":["August 2011","DOI:10.2991/eusflat.2011.125"],"references":["269151476_Foundations_of_many-valued_reasoning","266439038_Riesz_spaces_Vol_I","265332789_Product_MV-algebras","256719977_On_the_variety_of_Riesz_spaces","254892080_Introduction_to_Riesz_spaces","243022924_Interpretation_of_AF_C-algebras_in_Lukasiewicz_sentential_calculus","239036529_Partially_Ordered_Algebraic_Systems","239030598_A_New_Proof_of_the_Completeness_of_the_Lukasiewicz_Axioms","237579206_The_Kakutani_duality_for_MV-algebras","233753123_Rational_Lukasiewicz_logic_and_DMV-algebras"]}
