{"id":"324640336_Online_Misinformation_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","abstract":"Misinformation has become a common part of our digital media environments and it is compromising the ability of our societies to form informed opinions. It generates misperceptions, which have affected the decision making processes in many domains, including economy, health, environment, and elections, among others. Misinformation and its generation, propagation, impact, and management is being studied through a variety of lenses (computer science, social science, journalism, psychology, etc.) since it widely affects multiple aspects of society. In this paper we analyse the phenomenon of misinformation from a technological point of view. We study the current socio-technical advancements towards addressing the problem, identify some of the key limitations of current technologies, and propose some ideas to target such limitations. The goal of this position paper is to reflect on the current state of the art and to stimulate discussions on the future design and development of algorithms, methodologies, and applications.","authors":["Miriam Fernandez","Harith Alani"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1145/3184558.3188730","Conference: Companion of the The Web Conference 2018"],"references":["331929395_The_spreading_of_misinformation_online","318920444_Toward_Automated_Fact-Checking_Detecting_Check-worthy_Factual_Claims_by_ClaimBuster","318160572_Limited_individual_attention_and_online_virality_of_low-quality_information","317069544_Prior_Exposure_Increases_Perceived_Accuracy_of_Fake_News","312650820_Inoculating_the_Public_against_Misinformation_about_Climate_Change","309906984_Political_polarization_on_Twitter","309131681_Network_segregation_in_a_model_of_misinformation_and_fact_checking","301841797_Hoaxy_A_Platform_for_Tracking_Online_Misinformation","300918273_Using_TwitterTrailscom_to_Investigate_Rumor_Propagation","300336609_A_Model_for_Identifying_Misinformation_in_Online_Social_Networks","297673398_Political_rumoring_on_Twitter_during_the_2012_US_presidential_election_Rumor_diffusion_and_correction","289263634_The_spreading_of_misinformation_online","284788283_Analysing_How_People_Orient_to_and_Spread_Rumours_in_Social_Media_by_Looking_at_Conversational_Threads","281768604_Towards_Detecting_Compromised_Accounts_on_Social_Networks","281562384_The_Relevance_of_Algorithms","281377063_Serf_and_Turf_Crowdturfing_for_Fun_and_Profit","281274326_Viral_Misinformation_The_Role_of_Homophily_and_Polarization","280602900_In_Related_News_That_Was_Wrong_The_Correction_of_Misinformation_Through_Related_Stories_Functionality_in_Social_Media","276465245_Data_in_fact_out","276419985_Data_In_Fact_Out_Automated_Monitoring_of_Facts_by_FactWatcher","276067921_Political_science_Exposure_to_ideologically_diverse_news_and_opinion_on_Facebook","273462606_Crowdsourcing_the_Annotation_of_Rumourous_Conversations_in_Social_Media","272845437_Measuring_Online_Social_Bubbles","270905908_Computational_Fact_Checking_from_Knowledge_Networks","265730127_The_production_of_information_in_the_attention_economy","264123205_The_Rise_of_Social_Bots","263231769_Predicting_information_credibility_in_time-sensitive_social_media","262726174_A_Systematic_Review_of_Co-Creation_and_Co-Production_Embarking_on_the_Social_Innovation_Journey","262526065_TweetCred_A_Real-time_Web-based_System_for_Assessing_Credibility_of_Content_on_Twitter","262489474_Reverse_Engineering_Socialbot_Infiltration_Strategies_in_Twitter","262155635_The_promise_and_peril_of_real-time_corrections_to_political_misperceptions","261960295_Challenges_of_computational_verification_in_social_multimedia","258180567_Misinformation_and_Its_Correction_Continued_Influence_and_Successful_Debiasing","332898925_The_Persistent_Effects_of_a_False_News_Shock","312955307_The_Nature_and_Origins_of_Misperceptions_Understanding_False_and_Unsupported_Beliefs_About_Politics_Nature_and_Origins_of_Misperceptions","303968247_Belief_Echoes_The_Persistent_Effects_of_Corrected_Misinformation","300635029_Limiting_the_Spread_of_Misinformation_While_Effectively_Raising_Awareness_in_Social_Networks","293293127_Misperceptions_the_Media_and_the_Iraq_War","284212820_Belief_Echoes_The_Persistent_Effects_of_Corrected_Misinformation","277621611_Displacing_Misinformation_about_Events_An_Experimental_Test_of_Causal_Corrections","265231179_The_Filter_Bubble_What_the_Internet_Is_Hiding_from_You","265169513_Early_filtering_of_ephemeral_malicious_accounts_on_Twitter","264340096_Undermining_the_Corrective_Effects_of_Media-Based_Political_Fact_Checking_The_Role_of_Contextual_Cues_and_Naive_Theory","263566813_The_Filter_Bubble_What_the_Internet_Is_Hiding_from_You","263229287_Beyond_the_Running_Tally_Partisan_Bias_in_Political_Perceptions","262172021_Containment_of_misinformation_spread_in_online_social_networks","262151647_'Misinformation_What_of_it'_Motivations_and_individual_differences_in_misinformation_sharing_on_social_media","261273055_Sources_of_misinformation_in_Online_Social_Networks_Who_to_suspect","260162996_Beliefs_Don't_Always_Persevere_How_Political_Figures_Are_Punished_When_Positive_Information_about_Them_Is_Discredited","258716529_Identifying_Rumors_and_Their_Sources_in_Social_Networks","228714606_Why_the_Death_Panel_Myth_Wouldn't_Die_Misinformation_in_the_Health_Care_Reform_Debate","228652278_Key_Strategies_for_the_Successful_Involvement_of_Customers_in_the_Co-Creation_of_New_Technology-Based_Services","247130879_Perceptions_of_Internet_Information_Credibility","240281720_Who_Hears_What_from_Whom_and_with_What_Effect_A_Study_of_Rumor","233822040_Birds_of_a_Feather_Homophily_in_Social_Networks"]}
