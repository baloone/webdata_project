{"id":"290271966_Checking_Landau's_Grundlagen_in_the_Automath_System","abstract":"This chapter describes the logic which Landau presupposes and its representation in AUT–QE is analyzed. The translation of Landau's book, the difficulties encountered and the way they were overcome are also discussed. A general survey is given of the various reasons to deviate occasionally from Landau's Text. The need to translate an existing mathematical text in an Automath language is to acquire experience in the use of such a language and to investigate to what extent mathematics could be represented in Automath in a natural way. The development of the logic and concepts from the axioms are described. Starting from the axioms for contradiction, the development of classical first order predicate calculus is straightforward. The development of the theory of equivalence classes requires the axioms for subtypes and for sets. The deviations from Landau's text appear occasionally. A survey of the primitive concepts and axioms (PN–lines) in the preliminary AUT–QE text is also provided in the chapter.","authors":["L.S. van Benthem Jutting"],"meta":["December 1994Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics 133:701-720","DOI:10.1016/S0049-237X(08)70222-2","In book: Selected Papers on Automath (pp.701-720)"],"references":[]}
