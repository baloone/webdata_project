{"id":"278733629_Detecting_Abnormal_Profiles_in_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommender_Systems","abstract":"Collaborative filtering recommender systems (CFRSs) are the key components of\nsuccessful e-commerce systems. In practice, CFRSs are also particularly\nvulnerable to \"shilling\" attacks or \"profile injection\" attacks since its\nopenness. The attackers can carefully inject chosen attack profiles into CFRSs\nin order to bias the recommendation results to their benefits. To reduce this\nrisk, various detection techniques have been proposed to detect such attacks,\nwhich use diverse features extracted from user profiles. However, relying on\nlimited features to improve the detection performance is difficult seemingly,\nsince the existing features can not fully characterize the attack profiles and\ngenuine profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method to make\nrecommender systems resistant to the \"shilling\" attacks or \"profile injection\"\nattacks. The existing features can be briefly summarized as two aspects\nincluding rating behavior based and item distribution based. We firstly\nformulate the problem as finding a mapping model between rating behavior and\nitem distribution by exploiting the least-squares approximate solution. Based\non the trained model, we design a detector by employing a regressor to detect\nsuch attacks. Extensive experiments on both the MovieLens-100K and\nMovieLens-ml-latest-small datasets examine the effectiveness of our proposed\ndetection method. Experimental results were included to validate the\noutperformance of our approach in comparison with benchmarked method.","authors":["Zhihai Yang"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Intelligent Information Systems 48(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10844-016-0424-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257676543_Shilling_attack_detection_utilizing_semi-supervised_learning_method_for_collaborative_recommender_system","254464464_HySAD_A_semi-supervised_hybrid_shilling_attack_detector_for_trustworthy_product_recommendation","275202564_A_Robust_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_Algorithm_Based_on_Multidimensional_Trust_Model","274436956_Toward_trustworthy_recommender_systems","262311470_A_belief_propagation_approach_for_detecting_shilling_attacks_in_collaborative_filtering","261763825_HHT-SVM_An_Online_Method_for_Detecting_Profile_Injection_Attacks_in_Collaborative_Recommender_Systems","261418284_Graph-based_detection_of_shilling_attacks_in_recommender_systems","257574336_Defending_recommender_systems_by_influence_analysis","257015858_bPbP_A_novel_approach_to_filter_out_malicious_rating_profiles_from_recommender_systems","254009526_Detection_of_shilling_attacks_in_collaborative_filtering_recommender_systems","228529307_Evaluation_From_Precision_Recall_and_F-Factor_to_ROC_Informedness_Markedness_Correlation","221654652_Classification_features_for_attack_detection_in_collaborative_recommender_systems","221654352_Detecting_Profile_Injection_Attacks_in_Collaborative_Filtering_A_Classification-Based_Approach","233895729_Shilling_attacks_against_recommender_systems_A_comprehensive_survey","228436799_Detecting_Aircraft_Performance_Anomalies_from_Cruise_Flight_Data"]}
