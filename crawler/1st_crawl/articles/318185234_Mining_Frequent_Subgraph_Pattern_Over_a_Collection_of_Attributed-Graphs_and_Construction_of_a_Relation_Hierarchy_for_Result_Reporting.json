Besides the description of an entity, a graph representation can also represent the relation of the entities to each other and by doing that it can be build up a complex network of knowledge pieces. These networks may be different kinds of networks such as telecommunication networks, computer networks, biological networks, and Web and social community networks. There are broad applications that require graph-based representations such as chemical informatics, bioinformatics, computer vision, video indexing, text retrieval, and Web analysis. Attributed graphs are a special form of graphs that describe the nodes and the edges of a graph by attributes. An important task of graph mining is mining frequent subgraph patterns. The summarization of graphs into groups of subgraphs are used for further characterization, discrimination, classification, and cluster analysis of a collection of graphs. In this paper, we introduce mining frequent subgraph pattern over a collection of attributed graphs. We describe the graph representation. We explain the fast graph-matching algorithm. How to deal with the similarity on the attributes on the nodes and the edges is described. Then, we explain the main part of our paper our algorithm for frequent subgraph mining. We describe how the found results can be reported in such a way that a human can easily overlook the results and how he can use the discovered knowledge for his application. The reporting is done by constructing a relation hierarchy over the discovered groups of subgraphs. The user gets the relation hierarchy of the subgraphs graphically displayed. We give results for our algorithm on an application of attributed image graphs. These image graphs have been obtained by automatic image analysis of ultra-sonic images of welding seams. The task was to classify the images into different defects such as pore, whole, and cracks.","authors":["Petra Perner"],"meta":["July 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-62701-4_26","Conference: Industrial Conference on Data Mining","Project: Worldcongress The Frontier of Intelligent Data and Signal Analysis DSA 2018"],"references":["315941260_Discovering_suspicious_behavior_in_multilayer_social_networks","314119409_Link_and_Graph_Mining_in_the_Big_Data_Era","303206384_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","300409085_The_Semantic_Web_for_Complex_Network_Analysis_in_Biomedical_Domain","263242423_Knowledge_Acquisition_Via_Incremental_Conceptual_Clustering","244186114_Using_CBR_Learning_for_the_Low-Level_and_High-Level_Unit_of_a_Image_Interpretation_System","225787218_Similarity_measures_for_structured_representations","223375587_Case-base_maintenance_by_conceptual_clustering_of_graphs","222453756_Models_of_Incremental_Concept_Formation","222445329_A_Theory_and_Methodology_of_Inductive_Learning"]}
