{"id":"349018413_Teaching_in_an_open_village_a_case_study_on_culturally_responsive_computing_in_compulsory_education","abstract":"Background: As teachers work to broaden the participation of racially and ethnically underrepresented groups in computer science (CS), culturally responsive computing (CRC) becomes more pertinent to formal settings.\nObjective: Yet, equity-oriented literature offers limited guidance for developing deep forms of CRC in the classroom. In response, we support the claim that “it takes a village” to develop equity-oriented CS education but additively highlight the roles of cultural experts in the process.\nMethods: We use a case study methodology to explore one instance of this: a collaboration between a multi-racial team of researchers, a Black cosmetologist, and a White technology teacher.\nFindings: Three themes supported the CRC collaboration: multi-directional relationship building, iterative engagement with culture-computing, and collaborative implementation of a hybrid lesson.\nImplications: As opposed to orienting broadening participation around extractive metaphors like “pipelines,” our case study constructs the metaphor of an “open village” to orient CS education toward collaborations between schools and the communities they serve.","authors":["Michael L Lachney","Audrey Bennett","Ron Eglash","Aman Yadav"],"meta":["February 2021Computer Science Education","DOI:10.1080/08993408.2021.1874228"],"references":["344090539_Authente-Kente_enabling_authentication_for_artisanal_economies_with_deep_learning","338830335_A_Voice_to_Talk_About_it_Cosmetologists_as_STEM_Experts_in_Educational_Technology_Design_and_Implementation","338061455_Decolonizing_education_with_Anishinaabe_arcs_generative_STEM_as_a_path_to_indigenous_futurity","334217946_Generative_computing_African-American_cosmetology_as_a_link_between_computing_education_and_community_wealth","355005527_Ethnocomputing_and_Computational_Thinking","341507994_Geometry_from_Africa","340819029_It_Takes_a_Village_Understanding_African_American_High_School_Students'_Self-Determination_in_School","339462823_Computing_and_community_in_formal_education","338795323_Brushed_aside_African_American_women's_narratives_of_hair_bias_in_school","333137308_Ancestral_Knowledge_Meets_Computer_Science_Education_Environmental_Change_in_Community"]}
