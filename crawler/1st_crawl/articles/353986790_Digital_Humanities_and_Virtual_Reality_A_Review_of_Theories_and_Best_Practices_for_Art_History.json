{"id":"353986790_Digital_Humanities_and_Virtual_Reality_A_Review_of_Theories_and_Best_Practices_for_Art_History","abstract":"The technology of virtual reality (VR) has had proven educational benefits over the last three decades. Yet, most research conducted on these benefits has been confined to the sciences, especially in Computer Science. The application of VR technology for the Digital Humanities is only now beginning to receive attention, but more study needs to be conducted on its uses within various humanistic disciplines. In order to expand on the research at a pivotal time in education when modalities expand to incorporate more hybrid, distance education, and online learning, this study reviews the literature and theories behind the educational use of VR as a tool to reinforce learning outcomes in the field of art history. Through the review, theories and best practices are presented for practical adoption at various level of instruction at other institutions, as well as a list of recommendations for integrating VR technology specifically within art history instruction.","authors":["James Hutson","Trent Olsen"],"meta":["July 2021International Journal of Technology in Education 4(3):491-500","DOI:10.46328/ijte.150"],"references":["344428956_Augmented_Reality_and_Virtual_Reality_A_360_Immersion_into_Western_History_of_Architecture","337836234_A_systematic_review_of_immersive_virtual_reality_applications_for_higher_education_Design_elements_lessons_learned_and_research_agenda","272677840_Virtual_Reality_in_Education","265805546_Virtual_Heritage_Researching_and_Visualizing_the_Past_in_3D","224249358_Towards_an_Online_Multiplayer_Serious_Game_Providing_a_Joyful_Experience_in_Learning_Art_History","245704778_Communication_design_in_virtual_reality","241684950_Connectivism_Learning_theory_and_pedagogical_practice_for_networked_information_landscapes","233471840_Museums_and_virtual_reality_using_the_CAVE_to_simulate_the_past","232524016_Learning_Theories_An_Educational_Perspective","223744474_Investigating_learners'_attitudes_toward_virtual_reality_learning_environments_Based_on_a_constructivist_approach","221093731_The_Contribution_of_3-D_Environments_to_Conceptual_Understanding","3735424_The_NICE_project_Learning_together_in_a_virtual_world","222757678_Virtual_Reality_in_the_Real_World","220017733_Connectivism_A_Learning_Theory_for_the_Digital_Age","201382146_A_Model_for_Understanding_How_Virtual_Reality_Aids_Complex_Conceptual_Learning"]}
