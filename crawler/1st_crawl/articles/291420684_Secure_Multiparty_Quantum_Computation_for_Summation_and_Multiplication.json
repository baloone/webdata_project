{"id":"291420684_Secure_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_for_Summation_and_Multiplication","abstract":"As a fundamental primitive, Secure Multiparty Summation and Multiplication can be used to build complex secure protocols for other multiparty computations, specially, numerical computations. However, there is still lack of systematical and efficient quantum methods to compute Secure Multiparty Summation and Multiplication. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient quantum approach to securely compute the summation and multiplication of multiparty private inputs, respectively. Compared to classical solutions, our proposed approach can ensure the unconditional security and the perfect privacy protection based on the physical principle of quantum mechanics.","authors":["Run-hua Shi","Yi Mu","Hong Zhong","Jie Cui"],"meta":["January 2016Scientific Reports 6(1):19655","DOI:10.1038/srep19655"],"references":["284172476_A_generalized_architecture_of_quantum_secure_direct_communication_for_N_disjointed_users_with_authentication","283975632_Two_Quantum_Protocols_for_Oblivious_Set-member_Decision_Problem","233873239_Complete_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Protocols_for_Classical_Two-Party_Computation","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","314829083_Secure_multi-party_quantum_computation","293222400_Non-interactive_and_optimally_resilient_distributed_multiplication","293178577_Secure_multiparty_quantum_summation","272017430_A_practical_protocol_for_three-party_authenticated_quantum_key_distribution","263003924_Authenticated_semi-quantum_key_distribution_protocol_using_Bell_states","257507069_Quantum_Counting_Algorithm_and_Error_Distribution"]}
