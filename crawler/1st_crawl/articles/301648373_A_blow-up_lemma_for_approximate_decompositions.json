{"id":"301648373_A_blow-up_lemma_for_approximate_decompositions","abstract":"We develop a new method for constructing approximate decompositions of dense graphs into sparse graphs and apply it to long-standing decomposition problems. For instance, our results imply the following. Let G G be a quasi-random n n -vertex graph and suppose H 1 , … , H s H_1,\\dots ,H_s are bounded degree n n -vertex graphs with ∑ i = 1 s e ( H i ) ≤ ( 1 − o ( 1 ) ) e ( G ) \\sum _{i=1}^{s} e(H_i) \\leq (1-o(1)) e(G) . Then H 1 , … , H s H_1,\\dots ,H_s can be packed edge-disjointly into G G . The case when G G is the complete graph K n K_n implies an approximate version of the tree packing conjecture of Gyárfás and Lehel for bounded degree trees, and of the Oberwolfach problem.\nWe provide a more general version of the above approximate decomposition result which can be applied to super-regular graphs and thus can be combined with Szemerédi’s regularity lemma. In particular our result can be viewed as an extension of the classical blow-up lemma of Komlós, Sárkőzy, and Szemerédi to the setting of approximate decompositions.","authors":["Jaehoon Kim","Daniela Kühn","Deryk Osthus","Mykhaylo Tyomkyn"],"meta":["April 2016Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 371(7)","DOI:10.1090/tran/7411"],"references":["288890271_Packing_spanning_graphs_from_separable_families","265368257_Proof_of_a_conjecture_of_P_Erdos","262985496_An_approximate_version_of_the_Tree_Packing_Conjecture","233922822_On_the_Tree_Packing_Conjecture","232011114_On_the_Bollobas-Eldridge_Conjecture_for_Bipartite_Graphs","224053699_Cycle_decompositions_V_Complete_graphs_into_cycles_of_arbitrary_lengths","220184921_Proof_of_Alon-Yuster_Conjecture","310610965_The_existence_of_designs_via_iterative_absorption","305876300_Proof_of_the_1-factorization_and_Hamilton_Decomposition_Conjectures","301878306_Packing_minor-closed_families_of_graphs_into_complete_graphs","290898640_The_Existence_of_Resolvable_Block_Designs","283279864_Packing_large_trees_of_consecutive_orders","278697677_Blow-up_Lemma","273067293_Optimal_path_and_cycle_decompositions_of_dense_quasirandom_graphs","268496537_Random_Graphs","267214293_Edge-decompositions_of_graphs_with_high_minimum_degree","267078968_Asymptotic_Existence_of_Resolvable_Graph_Designs","266438363_Packing_trees_of_different_order_into_K_n","266346253_Packing_and_covering_of_the_complete_graph_III_On_the_tree_packing_conjecture","259363705_On_Two_Conjectures_on_Packing_of_Graphs","247873977_The_existence_of_resolvable_designs","243134638_EveryH-decomposition_ofKnhas_a_Nearly_Resolvable_Alternative","239063465_Decomposition_of_complete_graphs_into_subgraphs_isomorphic_to_a_given_graph","235058342_Regular_Partitions_of_Graphs","231964815_Spanning_Trees_in_Dense_Graphs","227763323_The_Hamilton-Waterloo_Problem_The_Case_of_Triangle-Factors_and_One_Hamilton_Cycle","227258599_Proof_of_the_Seymour_Conjecture_for_Large_Graphs","226762494_Perfect_Matchings_in_e-Regular_Graphs_and_the_Blow-Up_Lemma","225847077_Proof_of_the_bandwidth_conjecture_of_Bollobas_and_Komlos","223097044_The_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_the_Regularity_Lemma","221668481_Hamilton_decompositions_of_regular_expanders_Applications","221667372_Hamilton_decompositions_of_regular_expanders_A_proof_of_Kelly's_conjecture_for_large_tournaments","220617576_A_Fast_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Frequencies_of_Subgraphs_in_a_Given_Graph","220357692_Packing_Trees_Into_The_Complete_Graph","220188118_Some_remarks_on_packing_trees","220186452_Packing_trees_in_complete_graphs","220078994_Packing_d-degenerate_graphs","48308698_The_Power_of_Collision_Randomized_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Chaining_and_Integer_Sorting","43524531_Complete_solutions_to_the_Oberwolfach_problem_for_an_infinite_set_of_orders","23805637_Embedding_large_subgraphs_into_dense_graphs","2340781_Perfect_Matchings_in_-Regular_Graphs","2126907_The_minimum_degree_threshold_for_perfect_graph_packings"]}
