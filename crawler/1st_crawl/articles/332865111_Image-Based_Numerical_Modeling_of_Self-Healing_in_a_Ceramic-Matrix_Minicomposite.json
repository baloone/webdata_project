{"id":"332865111_Image-Based_Numerical_Modeling_of_Self-Healing_in_a_Ceramic-Matrix_Minicomposite","abstract":"Self-healing, obtained by the oxidation of a glass-forming phase, is a crucial phenomenon to ensure the lifetime of new-generation refractory ceramic-matrix composites. The dynamics of oxygen diffusion, glass formation and flow are the basic ingredients of a self-healing model that has been developed here in 2D in a transverse crack of a mini-composite. The presented model can work on a realistic image of the material section and is able to simulate the healing process and to quantify the exposure of the material to oxygen: a prerequisite for its lifetime prediction. Crack reopening events are handled satisfactorily, and healing under cyclic loading can be simulated. This paper describes and discusses a typical case in order to show the model capabilities.","authors":["Grégory Perrot","Guillaume Couégnat","Mario Ricchiuto","Gerard L.
