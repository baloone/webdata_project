{"id":"285081650_Reconstruction_of_building_outlines_in_dense_urban_areas_based_on_LIDAR_data_and_address_points","abstract":"The paper presents a comprehensive method for automated extraction and delineation of building outlines in densely built-up areas.\nA novel approach to outline reconstruction is the use of geocoded building address points. They give information about building\nlocation thus highly reduce task complexity. Reconstruction process is executed on 3D point clouds acquired by airborne laser\nscanner. The method consists of three steps: building detection, delineation and contours refinement. The algorithm is tested against\na data set that presents the old market town and its surroundings. The results are discussed and evaluated by comparison to reference\ncadastral data.","authors":["Małgorzata Jarząbek-Rychard"],"meta":["July 2012ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 39:121-126","DOI:10.5194/isprsarchives-XXXIX-B3-121-2012"],"references":["254202296_OPENGEOCODINGORG_-_A_FREE_PARTICIPATORY_COMMUNITY_ORIENTED_GEOCODING_SERVICE","229346881_Automatic_detection_of_residential_buildings_using_LIDAR_data_and_multispectral_imagery","228671865_A_test_of_automatic_building_change_detection_approaches","228610502_3D_building_model_reconstruction_from_point_clouds_and_ground_plans","228451885_Building_Footprints_Extraction_of_Dense_Residential_Areas_from_LiDAR_data","216727699_Building_Boundary_Tracing_and_Regularization_from_Airborne_LIDAR_Point_Clouds","292013007_Detection_of_unregistered_buildings_for_updating_2D_databases","291797516_Evaluation_of_building_extraction","223666575_Towards_automatic_building_extraction_from_high-resolution_digital_elevation_models","222875118_An_update_on_automatic_3D_building_reconstruction"]}
