{"id":"331532688_Redesigning_flipped_classrooms_a_learning_model_and_its_effects_on_student_perceptions","abstract":"To maximize learners’ performance promotion in flipped classroom, this research redesigns a flipped classroom with four integrated practices: speed response questions, teacher face-to-face counselling, independent practices and team projects. Using questionnaire (N = 66) and interview (N = 20) data, the model is tested in two undergraduate introductory computer science courses in China, where students are typically reticent to engage in active learning in class. Data from a bipolar scale revealed that the majority of students regarded the new model as more student-centred. Using a learning capability matrix, this research deeply explored the benefits by learning dimension. The interviews provided details on the students’ positive attitudes to the model and one area of concern. This research may be helpful for the scholars who are redesigning their flipped classrooms or developing new in-class activities.","authors":["Yanqing Wang","Xinzhuo Huang","Christian D Schunn","Yan Zou"],"meta":["September 2019Higher Education 78(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10734-019-00366-8","Project: Peer Assessment in MOOCs"],"references":["285935974_The_flipped_classroom_A_survey_of_the_research","282186138_Increased_Preclass_Preparation_Underlies_Student_Outcome_Improvement_in_the_Flipped_Classroom","345924291_Flipping_The_Classroom_To_Explore_Active_Learning_In_A_Large_Undergraduate_Course","292719942_A_reconceptualisation_of_the_research_into_university_academics_conceptions_of_teaching","287456308_Willingness_to_communicate_in_the_Chinese_EFL_classroom_A_cultural_perspective","287104845_The_Flipped_Classroom_Online_instruction_at_home_frees_class_time_for_learning","285683322_Upside_down_and_inside_out_Flip_your_classroom_to_improve_student_learning","285483645_Using_lean_in_the_flipped_classroom_for_at_risk_students","284043564_Student_views_on_the_use_of_a_flipped_classroom_approach_Evidence_from_Australia","277877704_Introduction_to_Flipping_the_College_Classroom","265051052_Motivation_and_cognitive_load_in_the_flipped_classroom_definition_rationale_and_a_call_for_research","264860703_Case_Studies_and_the_Flipped_Classroom","262017389_The_Experience_of_Three_Flipped_Classrooms_in_an_Urban_University_An_Exploration_of_Design_Principles","263893360_Is_FLIP_enough_or_should_we_use_the_FLIPPED_model_instead","263307153_Developing_Information_Literacy_and_Critical_Thinking_Skills_through_Domain_Knowledge_Learning_in_Digital_Classrooms_An_Experience_of_Practicing_Flipped_Classroom_Strategy"]}
