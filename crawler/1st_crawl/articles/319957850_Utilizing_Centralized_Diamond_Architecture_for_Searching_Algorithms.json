{"id":"319957850_Utilizing_Centralized_Diamond_Architecture_for_Searching_Algorithms","abstract":"Searching data elements and information in a fraction of time is still an important task for many areas of works. The importance of finding the best answer leads to use different algorithms which consume time. To improve the speed of searching information within mass information, employing parallel processing is inevitable. A search algorithm with constant time(CS) is proposed on centralized diamond architecture. We have optimized this algorithm to find the location and the number of occurrence of data, if there exists any.","authors":["Masumeh Damrudi","Kamal Jadidy Aval"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Physics Conference Series 892(1):012001","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/892/1/012001"],"references":["234148608_Parallel_Algorithmic_Techniques_For_Combinational_Computation","233933838_A_new_parallel_sorting_on_Diamond_architecture","261423549_The_optimal_running_time_from_computational_models_by_comparing_two_parallel_searching_procedures","233933844_Searching_Data_Using_Centralized_Diamond_Architecture","233933840_ENOD_sort_on_Diamond_architecture","224099805_Diamond_architecture_with_NOD_sorting","3511383_Efficient_parallel_algorithms_for_selection_and_searching_on_sorted_matrices"]}
