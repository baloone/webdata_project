{"id":"281262456_A_Practical_ORloglog_nn_time_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence","abstract":"In this paper, we revisit the much studied LCS problem for two given\nsequences. Based on the algorithm of Iliopoulos and Rahman for solving the LCS\nproblem, we have suggested 3 new improved algorithms. We first reformulate the\nproblem in a very succinct form. The problem LCS is abstracted to an abstract\ndata type DS on an ordered positive integer set with a special operation\nUpdate(S,x). For the two input sequences X and Y of equal length n, the first\nimproved algorithm uses a van Emde Boas tree for DS and its time and space\ncomplexities are O(R\\log\\log n+n) and O(R), where R is the number of matched\npairs of the two input sequences. The second algorithm uses a balanced binary\nsearch tree for DS and its time and space complexities are O(R\\log L+n) and\nO(R), where L is the length of the longest common subsequence of X and Y. The\nthird algorithm uses an ordered vector for DS and its time and space\ncomplexities are O(nL) and O(R).","authors":["Daxin Zhu","Lei Wang","Yingjie Wu","Xiaodong Wang"],"meta":["August 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220693689_Algorithms_on_Strings","220543755_A_New_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence","228057969_Algorithms_on_Stings_Trees_and_Sequences","226257783_An_OND_Difference_Algorithm_and_Its_Variations","222705234_New_efficient_algorithms_for_the_LCS_and_constrained_LCS_problems","222447182_A_Faster_Algorithm_Computing_String_Edit_Distances","222431682_Algorithms_for_computing_variants_of_the_longest_common_subsequence_problem","220788899_A_New_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence","220431502_Algorithms_for_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Problem","220431230_The_String-to-String_Correction_Problem","220422318_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Computing_Longest_Common_Subsequences","220197952_A_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Algorithm_Suitable_for_Similar_Text_Strings","220110813_Emde_Boas_P_Preserving_Order_in_a_Forest_in_Less_Than_Logarithmic_Time_and_Linear_Space_Inf_Process_Letters_63_80-82","3871316_A_survey_of_longest_common_subsequence_algorithms"]}
