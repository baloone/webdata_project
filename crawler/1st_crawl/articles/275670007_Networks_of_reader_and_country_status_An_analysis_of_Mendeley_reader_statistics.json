{"id":"275670007_Networks_of_reader_and_country_status_An_analysis_of_Mendeley_reader_statistics","abstract":"The number of papers published in journals indexed by the Web of Science core\ncollection is steadily increasing. In recent years, nearly two million new\npapers were published each year; somewhat more than one million papers when\nprimary research articles are considered only. Sophisticated and compact\nbibliometric methods have to be applied in order to obtain an overview. One\npopular method is a network-based analysis. In this study, we analyze Mendeley\nreadership data of a set of 1,133,224 articles and 64,960 reviews with\npublication year 2012 to generate three networks: (1) The network based on\ndisciplinary affiliations points out similarities of and differences in\nreaderships of papers. (2) The status group network shows which status groups\n(e.g. students, lecturers, or professors) commonly read and bookmark papers.\n(3) The country network focusses on global readership patterns: It visualizes\nsimilar and different reading patterns of papers at the country level. With\nthese networks we explore the usefulness of readership data for networking.","authors":["Robin Haunschild","Lutz Bornmann","Loet Leydesdorff"],"meta":["April 2015PeerJ Computer Science 1(1)","DOI:10.7717/peerj-cs.32","SourcearXiv"],"references":["297513933_Mendeley_Enabling_and_understanding_scientific_collaboration","279553954_Assessing_the_Mendeley_readership_of_social_sciences_and_humanities_research","273499134_F1000Prime_an_analysis_of_discipline-specific_reader_data_from_Mendeley","271218294_A_Review_of_Theory_and_Practice_in_Scientometrics","278710539_Measuring_Scholarly_Impact","278698368_Measuring_Scholarly_Impact","276853125_Which_people_use_which_scientific_papers_An_evaluation_of_data_from_F1000_and_Mendeley","276364436_Not_All_International_Collaboration_is_Beneficial_The_Mendeley_Readership_and_Citation_Impact_of_Biochemical_Research_Collaboration","274705609_Journal_Portfolio_Analysis_for_Countries_Cities_and_Organizations_Maps_and_Comparisons","272522036_Journal_Portfolio_Analysis_for_Countries_Cities_and_Organizations_Maps_and_Comparisons"]}
