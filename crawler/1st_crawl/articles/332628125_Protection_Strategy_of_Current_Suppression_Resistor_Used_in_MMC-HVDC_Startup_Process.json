{"id":"332628125_Protection_Strategy_of_Current_Suppression_Resistor_Used_in_MMC-HVDC_Startup_Process","abstract":"The over-current in MMC-HVDC startup process is limited by the current suppression resistor, but there is a blank area in protecting current suppression resistor. First, we analyzed the electrical characteristics and the existing control strategy of the current suppression resistor, and described the current situation of the protection blank area in the existing protection methods. Then, we proposed an inverse time protection model according to the load characteristics of current suppression resistor, and designed an inverse time protection circuit. Moreover, we put forward systematically the scheme of current suppression resistor protection configuration The scheme uses inverse time protection as the main protection of current suppression resistor, and three kinds of auxiliary protection methods are equipped with over-current Ⅰ segment fast protection, over-current Ⅱ segment rapid protection and charge time protection. Finally, based on the Xiamen HVDC flexible transmission project, the design example of the current suppression resistor protection was given and the related tests were carried out. In one test, the charging current is not attenuated and the thermal effect of the current suppression resistor is seriously accumulated, and then the inverse time protection is acted in time after 4.67 s. The test results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the current suppression resistor protection strategy proposed in this paper. © 2019, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.
