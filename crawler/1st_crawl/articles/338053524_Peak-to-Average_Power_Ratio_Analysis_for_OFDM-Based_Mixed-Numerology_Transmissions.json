{"id":"338053524_Peak-to-Average_Power_Ratio_Analysis_for_OFDM-Based_Mixed-Numerology_Transmissions","abstract":"In this paper, the probability distribution of the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) is analyzed for the mixed numerologies transmission based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). State of the art theoretical analysis implicitly assumes continuous and symmetric frequency spectrum of OFDM signals. Thus, it is difficult to be applied to the mixed-numerology system due to its complication. By comprehensively considering system parameters, including numerology, bandwidth and power level of each subband, we propose a generic analytical distribution function of PAPR for continuous-time signals based on level-crossing theory. The proposed approach can be applied to both conventional single numerology and mixed-numerology systems. In addition, it also ensures the validity for the noncontinuous-OFDM (NC-OFDM). Given the derived distribution expression, we further investigate the effect of power allocation between different numerologies on PAPR. Simulations are presented and show the good match of the proposed theoretical results.","authors":["Xiaoran Liu","Lei Zhang","Jun Xiong","Xiaoying Zhang"],"meta":["December 2019IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TVT.2019.2960801"],"references":["322515309_Resource_Allocation_for_Block-Based_Multi-Carrier_Systems_Considering_QoS_Requirements","315494233_Multi-Service_System_An_Enabler_of_Flexible_5G_Air_Interface","312609179_Subband_Filtered_Multi-Carrier_Systems_for_Multi-Service_Wireless_Communications","335634553_PAPR_Reduction_with_Mixed-Numerology_OFDM","322607674_A_Flexibility_Metric_and_Optimization_Methods_for_Mixed_Numerologies_in_5G_and_Beyond","317553892_5G_New_Radio_Waveform_Frame_Structure_Multiple_Access_and_Initial_Access","315799033_5G_Field_Trials-OFDM-based_Waveforms_and_Mixed_Numerologies","315509529_Modeling_the_Behavior_of_Peaks_of_OFDM_Signal_Using_'Peaks_over_Threshold'_Approach","310436443_Waveform_and_Numerology_to_Support_5G_Services_and_Requirements","310434783_On_the_Waveform_for_5G","273523127_Joint_PAPR_Reduction_and_Sidelobe_Suppression_Using_Signal_Cancelation_in_NC-OFDM-Based_Cognitive_Radio_Systems","264007042_Energy-efficient_NC-OFDMOQAM-based_cognitive_radio_networks","260712202_Peak-To-Average_Power_Ratio_Reduction_in_OFDM_Systems_A_Survey_And_Taxonomy","309761612_PAPR_analysis_in_noncontiguous_OFDM_systems","298090568_Minimizing_the_Error_Vector_Magnitude_With_Constrained_Cubic_Metric_and_Spectral_Sidelobe_in_NC-OFDM_Based_Cognitive_Radio_Systems"]}
