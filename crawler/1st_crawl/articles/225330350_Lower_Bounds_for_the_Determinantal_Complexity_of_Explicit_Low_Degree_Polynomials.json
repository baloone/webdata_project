{"id":"225330350_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Determinantal_Complexity_of_Explicit_Low_Degree_Polynomials","abstract":"Asymptotically tight lower bounds are proven for the determinantal complexity of the elementary symmetric polynomial SdnS^{d}_n of degree d in n variables, 2d-fold iterated matrix multiplication of the form åi=1n xid\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^d, for any constant d > 1.\n\nA restriction of determinantal computation is considered in which the underlying affine linear map must satisfy a rank lowerability\nproperty. In this model strongly nonlinear and exponential lower bounds are proven for several polynomial families. For example,\nfor S2dnS^{2d}_n it is proved that the determinantal complexity using so-called r-lowerable maps is Ω(n\n\nd/(2d − r)), for constants d and r with 2 ≤ d + 1 ≤ r < 2d. In the most restrictive setting an nW(en1/5-e)n^{\\Omega(\\epsilon n^{1/5-\\epsilon})} lower bound is observed, for any ε ∈ (0, 1/5) and d = ën1/5-eûd = \\lfloor n^{1/5-\\epsilon}\\rfloor.","authors":["Maurice J.
