{"id":"316272510_On_Measuring_Bias_in_Online_Information","abstract":"Bias in online information has recently become a pressing issue, with search engines, social networks and recommendation services being accused of exhibiting some form of bias. In this vision paper, we make the case for a systematic approach towards measuring bias. To this end, we discuss formal measures for quantifying the various types of bias, we outline the system components necessary for realizing them, and we highlight the related research challenges and open problems.","authors":["Evaggelia Pitoura","Panayiotis Tsaparas","Giorgos Flouris","Irini Fundulaki"],"meta":["April 2017ACM SIGMOD Record 46(4)","DOI:10.1145/3186549.3186553"],"references":["322587393_Men_Also_Like_Shopping_Reducing_Gender_Bias_Amplification_using_Corpus-level_Constraints","320883243_FAIR_A_Fair_Top-k_Ranking_Algorithm","318814144_Men_Also_Like_Shopping_Reducing_Gender_Bias_Amplification_using_Corpus-level_Constraints","317710761_FAIR_A_Fair_Top-k_Ranking_Algorithm","315871857_Fairness_Beyond_Disparate_Treatment_Disparate_Impact_Learning_Classification_without_Disparate_Mistreatment","346624964_The_Black_Box_Society_The_Secret_Algorithms_That_Control_Money_and_Information","323983704_Big_Data's_Disparate_Impact","318916375_Algorithmic_Decision_Making_and_the_Cost_of_Fairness","317996556_Social_Data_Biases_Methodological_Pitfalls_and_Ethical_Boundaries","317354198_Measuring_Fairness_in_Ranked_Outputs"]}
