{"id":"8506842_QuickJoin_-_Fast_neighbour-joining_tree_reconstruction","abstract":"We have built a tool for fast construction of very large phylogenetic trees. The tool uses heuristics for speeding up the neighbour-joining algorithm—while still constructing the same tree as the original neighbour-joining algorithm—making it possible to construct trees for 8000 species in <10 min on a single desktop PC. In comparison, the same task takes more than 30 min using the QuickTree neighbour-joining implementation.\nAvailability: The source code for QuickJoin is available from http://www.birc.dk/Software/QuickJoin under the GNU Public License (GPL).","authors":["Thomas Mailund","Christian N S Pedersen"],"meta":["November 2004Bioinformatics 20(17):3261-2","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/bth359","SourcePubMed"],"references":["220197855_Quad_Trees_A_Data_Structure_for_Retrieval_on_Composite_Keys","19934093_A_note_on_the_Neighbor-Joining_Algorithm_of_Saitou_and_Nei","11605638_The_Pfam_Protein_Families_Database","11042727_QuickTree_Building_Huge_Neighbour-Joining_Trees_of_Protein_Sequences","286215327_The_Neighbor-Joining_Method_A_New_Method_for_Reconstructing_Phylogenetic_Trees","273548297_The_Pfam_Protein_Families_Database","228556171_Speeding_up_neighbour-joining_tree_construction"]}
