{"id":"339897746_An_Improved_YOLOv3_Algorithm_for_Pedestrian_Detection_on_UAV_Imagery","abstract":"Pedestrian detection algorithms based on deep learning often rely on high-performance image processing platforms, and it does not adapt to high portability requirements of practical engineering. In order to solve the problem, an improved approach is proposed, which can be applied to embedded platforms. Firstly, reinforcing dense connectivity is adopted to connect the multiple layer features. Then the k-means++ algorithm is used to cluster the pedestrian targets, and the method of eliminating duplicate detection is optimized. Finally, the detection model is obtained through multi-scale training. Experiment results show that Dense-YOLOv3-tiny can detect pedestrian on UAV imagery in real time and exhibit higher precision and recall rate than the YOLOv3-tiny model in the embedded platforms.","authors":["Yulin Yang","Baolong Guo","Cheng Li","Yunpeng Zhi"],"meta":["March 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-981-15-3308-2_29","In book: Genetic and Evolutionary Computing (pp.253-261)"],"references":["332662087_Review_of_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_and_Architectures","319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","277411157_Deep_Learning","268452043_Ten_Years_of_Pedestrian_Detection_What_Have_We_Learned","322058119_Soft-NMS_-_Improving_Object_Detection_with_One_Line_of_Code","320967941_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_Stronger","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","311610683_How_Far_are_We_from_Solving_Pedestrian_Detection","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","278049038_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","275669302_Fast_r-cnn","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","220778887_K-Means_The_Advantages_of_Careful_Seeding"]}
