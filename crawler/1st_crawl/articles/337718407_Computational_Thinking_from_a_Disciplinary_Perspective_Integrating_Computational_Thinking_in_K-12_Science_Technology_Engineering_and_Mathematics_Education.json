{"id":"337718407_Computational_Thinking_from_a_Disciplinary_Perspective_Integrating_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_Education","abstract":"This article provides an introduction for the special issue of the Journal of Science Education and Technology focused on computational thinking (CT) from a disciplinary perspective. The special issue connects earlier research on what K-12 students can learn and be able to do using CT with the CT skills and habits of mind needed to productively participate in professional CT-integrated STEM fields. In this context, the phrase “disciplinary perspective” simultaneously holds two meanings: it refers to and aims to make connections between established K-12 STEM subject areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and newer CT-integrated disciplines such as computational sciences. The special issue presents a framework for CT integration and includes articles that illuminate what CT looks like from a disciplinary perspective, the challenges inherent in integrating CT into K-12 STEM education, and new ways of measuring CT aligned more closely with disciplinary practices. The aim of this special issue is to offer research-based and practitioner-grounded insights into recent work in CT integration and provoke new ways of thinking about CT integration from researchers, practitioners, and research-practitioner partnerships.","authors":["Irene Lee","Shuchi Grover","Fred Martin","Sarita Pillai"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of Science Education and Technology 29(3B)","DOI:10.1007/s10956-019-09803-w"],"references":["342317987_Balancing_the_Environment_Computational_Models_as_Interactive_Participants_in_a_STEM_Classroom","336709713_Teacher_Change_Following_a_Professional_Development_Experience_in_Integrating_Computational_Thinking_into_Elementary_Science","322104135_Computational_Thinking_A_Competency_Whose_Time_Has_Come","318380862_Epistemic_Network_Analysis_A_Worked_Example_of_Theory-Based_Learning_Analytics","316158531_The_practice_of_using_mathematics_and_computational_thinking","312430953_A_Tutorial_on_Epistemic_Network_Analysis_Analyzing_the_Structure_of_Connections_in_Cognitive_Social_and_Interaction_Data","307942866_Computational_Thinking_as_an_Emerging_Competence_Domain","303838619_Teaching_and_Assessing_Engineering_Design_Thinking_with_Virtual_Internships_and_Epistemic_Network_Analysis","324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","311334114_Introducing_computational_thinking_through_hands-on_projects_using_R_with_applications_to_calculus_probability_and_data_analysis"]}
