{"id":"305453426_Partially_Polynomial_Kernels_for_Set_Cover_and_Test_Cover","abstract":"An instance of the (n-k)-Set Cover or the (n-k)-Test Cover problems is of the form (U, S, k), where U is a set with n elements, S ⊆ 2U with |S| = m, and k is the parameter. The instance is a Yes-instance of (n - k)-Set Cover if and only if there exists S' ⊆ S with |S'| ≥ n - k such that every element of U is contained in some set in S'. Similarly, it is a Yes-instance of (n - k)-Test Cover if and only if there exists S' ⊆ S with |S'| ≤ n - k such that for any pair of elements from U, there exists a set in S' that contains one of them but not the other. It is known in the literature that both (n - k)-Set Cover and (n - k)-Test Cover do not admit polynomial kernels (under some well-known complexity theoretic assumptions). However, in this paper we show that they do admit \\partially polynomial kernels\": we give polynomial time algorithms that take as input an instance (U, S, k) of (n - k)-Set Cover (respectively, (n - k)-Test Cover) and return an equivalent instance (U, S, k) of (n-k)-Set Cover (respectively, (n-k)-Test Cover) with k ≤ k and |Ũ| = O(k²) (respectively, |Ũ| = O(k⁷)). These results allow us to generalize, improve, and unify several results known in the literature. For example, these immediately imply traditional kernels when input instances satisfy certain \\sparsity properties.\" Using a part of our partial kernelization algorithm for (n - k)-Set Cover, we also get an improved fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for this problem which runs in time O(4kkO(1)(m + n) + mn) improving over the previous best of O(8k+o(k)(m+n)O(1)). On the other hand, the partially polynomial kernel for (n-k)-Test Cover gives an algorithm with running time O(2O(k2)(m + n)O(1)). We believe such an approach could also be useful for other covering problems.","authors":["Manu Basavaraju","Mathew C Francis","Ramanujan M S","Saket Saurabh"],"meta":["January 2016SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 30(3):1401-1423","DOI:10.1137/15M1039584"],"references":["233815465_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_of_Satisfying_Beyond_the_Number_of_Variables","231337890_Parameterizations_of_Test_Cover_with_Bounded_Test_Sizes","220224235_On_Two_Techniques_of_Combining_Branching_and_Treewidth"]}
