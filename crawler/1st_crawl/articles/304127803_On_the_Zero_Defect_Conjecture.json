{"id":"304127803_On_the_Zero_Defect_Conjecture","abstract":"Brlek et al. conjectured in 2008 that any fixed point of a primitive morphism with finite palindromic defect is either periodic or its palindromic defect is zero. Bucci and Vaslet disproved this conjecture in 2012 by a counterexample over ternary alphabet. We prove that the conjecture is valid on binary alphabet. We also describe a class of morphisms over multiliteral alphabet for which the conjecture still holds.","authors":["Sébastien Labbé","Edita Pelantova","Štěpán Starosta"],"meta":["June 2016European Journal of Combinatorics 62","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2016.12.006"],"references":["260490446_Acyclic_connected_and_tree_sets","242744004_Combinatorial_properties_of_f-palindromes_in_the_Thue-Morse_sequence","45904611_Sturmian_Jungle_or_Garden_on_Multiliteral_Alphabets","2791602_Operators_With_Singular_Continuous_Spectrum_III_Almost_Periodic_Schrodinger_Operators","2618431_Singular_Continuous_Spectrum_for_Palindromic_Schrodinger_Operators","312948560_Exchange_of_three_intervals_Substitutions_and_palindromicity","267437932_Factor_complexity","266204201_Palindromic_sequences_generated_from_marked_morphisms","263987551_Almost_rich_words_as_morphic_images_of_rich_words","257145136_Proof_of_the_Brlek-Reutenauer_conjecture","246546830_A_Counterexample_to_a_Question_of_Hof_Knill_and_Simon","223125340_Mirror_substitutions_and_palindromic_sequences","222856878_Palindromes_and_Sturmian_words","222657208_A_connection_between_palindromic_and_factor_complexity_using_return_words","222547463_Palindromic_Richness","222394930_Episturmian_words_and_some_constructions_of_de_Luca_and_Rauzy","220180360_On_The_Palindromic_Complexity_Of_Infinite_Words"]}
