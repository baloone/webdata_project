{"id":"234817154_A_programming_system_for_the_on-line_analysis_of_biomedical_images","abstract":"A preliminary description of the software for a computer-display system is given with special emphasis on the man-machine interaction. This system is intended for a wide variety of biomedical applications. As an example, the methods are applied to the karyotyping of chromosomes. The system is separated into four programming tasks: picture transformations, file maintenance, picture structuring, and display management. Picture structuring is considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication. A prototype data format for pictures, called a picture-form, is developed. Structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce new picture-forms. Many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical laboratory at MIT conceived by Marvin Minsky.","authors":["Louis Hodes"],"meta":["May 1970Communications of the ACM 13(5):279-283","DOI:10.1145/362349.362351"],"references":["285098078_Picture_enhancement_for_the_moon_Mars_and_man","243753524_Image_Evaluation_and_Restoration","239571440_Pandemonium_A_paradigm_for_learning","234827637_Recognition_of_sloppy_hand-printed_characters","234796450_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Skeletons_Using_a_Quasi-Euclidean_Distance","220566714_Picture_Processing_by_Computer","17947805_The_analysis_of_cell_images","3476283_Computer_Interpretation_of_English_Text_and_Picture_Patterns","3476123_The_Illinois_pattern_recognition_computer-Illiac_III","3474157_Pattern_Recognition_Using_Autocorrelation"]}
