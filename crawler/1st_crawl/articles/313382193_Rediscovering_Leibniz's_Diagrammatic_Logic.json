{"id":"313382193_Rediscovering_Leibniz's_Diagrammatic_Logic","abstract":"In this paper we recover Leibniz's diagrammatic logic for syllogistic and we discover its computational and logical features by providing a formal approach to it in metalogical terms, which is something that, as far as we know, is yet to be accomplished. Thus, in this contribution we pursue, respectively, two goals, a historical and a logical one: i) to bring more attention on the algorithmic aspects of Leibniz's diagrammatic system for syllogistic, which be believe have been neglected because of a general bias against diagram-based reasoning;\nand ii) to prove metalogical properties of the system in order to argue that such system is a bona fide logical system.","authors":["J.
