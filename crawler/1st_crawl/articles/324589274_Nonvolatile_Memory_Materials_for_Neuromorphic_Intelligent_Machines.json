{"id":"324589274_Nonvolatile_Memory_Materials_for_Neuromorphic_Intelligent_Machines","abstract":"Recent progress in deep learning extends the capability of artificial intelligence to various practical tasks, making the deep neural network (DNN) an extremely versatile hypothesis. While such DNN is virtually built on contemporary data centers of the von Neumann architecture, physical (in part) DNN of non‐von Neumann architecture, also known as neuromorphic computing, can remarkably improve learning and inference efficiency. Particularly, resistance‐based nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM) highlights its handy and efficient application to the multiply–accumulate (MAC) operation in an analog manner. Here, an overview is given of the available types of resistance‐based NVRAMs and their technological maturity from the material‐ and device‐points of view. Examples within the strategy are subsequently addressed in comparison with their benchmarks (virtual DNN in deep learning). A spiking neural network (SNN) is another type of neural network that is more biologically plausible than the DNN. The successful incorporation of resistance‐based NVRAM in SNN‐based neuromorphic computing offers an efficient solution to the MAC operation and spike timing‐based learning in nature. This strategy is exemplified from a material perspective. Intelligent machines are categorized according to their architecture and learning type. Also, the functionality and usefulness of NVRAM‐based neuromorphic computing are addressed. Resistance‐based nonvolatile random access memory and its potential use in intelligent machines, particularly neuromorphic computing systems, are reviewed. Various types of intelligent machine and strategies for nonvolatile random‐access‐memory‐based neuromorphic computing are classified by network architecture and learning rule.","authors":["Doo Seok
