{"id":"3747013_Hidden_Markov_models_for_face_recognition","abstract":"The work presented in this paper focuses on the use of hidden\nMarkov models for face recognition. A new method based on the extraction\nof 2D-DCT feature vectors is described, and the recognition results are\ncompared with other face recognition approaches. The method introduced\nreduces significantly the computational complexity of previous HMM-based\nface recognition system, while preserving the same recognition\nrate","authors":["Ara V.
