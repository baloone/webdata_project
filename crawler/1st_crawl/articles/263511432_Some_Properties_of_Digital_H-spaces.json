{"id":"263511432_Some_Properties_of_Digital_H-spaces","abstract":"In this paper, we study certain properties of digital H-spaces. We prove that a digital image that has the same digital homotopy type with any digital H-space is also a digital H-space. We show that the digital fundamental group of a digital H-space is abelian. We give examples that are related to a digital homotopy associative H-space and a κ -contractible digital H-space. Several important applications of digital H-spaces are given in computer vision and image processing. Finally, we deal with the importance of digital H-space in digital topology and image processing. We conclude that any κ-contractible digital image is a digital H-space.","authors":["Özgür Ege","Ismet Karaca"],"meta":["July 2014Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences","DOI:10.3906/elk-1311-69"],"references":["259233914_Cohomology_Theory_for_Digital_Images","258837363_Lefschetz_fixed_point_theorem_for_digital_images","226706651_Properties_of_Digital_Homotopy","285021978_Digital_Picture_Processing","268633270_Introduction_to_Homotopy_Theory","257468817_Oriented_Surfaces_in_Digital_Spaces","247043479_On_the_Non-Existence_of_Elements_of_Hopf_Invariant_One","245247637_Algebraic_Topology-Homotopy_and_Homology","242816687_Finitary_1Simply_Connected_Digital_Spaces","236176949_Fundamental_Groups_for_Digital_Products"]}
