{"id":"293191680_Design_implementation_and_performance_evaluation_of_a_flexible_low_latency_and_low_cost_nano-Watt_Wake-Up_Radio_Receiver","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received significant attention in recent years and have found a wide range of applications, including structural and environmental monitoring, mobile health, home automation, Internet of Things, and others. As these systems are generally battery operated, major research efforts focus on reducing power consumption, especially for communication, as the radio transceiver is one of the most power-hungry components of a WSN. Moreover, with the advent of energy-neutral systems, the emphasis has shifted toward research in microwatt (or even nanowatt) communication protocols or systems. A significant number of wake-up radio receiver (WUR) architectures have been proposed to reduce the communication power of WSN nodes. In this work, we present an optimized ultra-low power (nanowatt) wake-up receiver for use in WSNs, designed with low-cost off-the-shelf components. The wake-up receiver achieves power consumption of 152 nW (with-32 dBm sensitivity), sensitivity up to-55 dBm (with maximum power of 1,2 μW), latency from 8 μs, tunable frequency, and short commands communication. In addition, a low power solution, which includes addressing capability directly in the wake-up receiver, is proposed. Experimental results and simulations demonstrate low power consumption, functionality, and benefits of the design optimization compared with other solutions, as well as the benefits of addressing false positive (FP) outcomes reduction.","authors":["Michele Magno","Vana Jelicic","Bruno Srbinovski","Vedran Bilas"],"meta":["April 2016IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics 12(2):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TII.2016.2524982","Project: Wake Up Radio and Energy efficient Communication"],"references":["289090000_An_ultra_low_power_high_sensitivity_wake-up_radio_receiver_with_addressing_capability","269165065_Beyond_Duty_Cycling_Wake-up_Radio_with_Selective_Awakenings_for_Long-lived_Wireless_Sensing_Systems","264387657_Benefits_of_Wake-Up_Radio_in_Energy-Efficient_Multimodal_Surveillance_Wireless_Sensor_Network","262056514_A_Joint_Duty-Cycle_and_Transmission_Power_Management_for_Energy_Harvesting_WSN","278653630_Wirelessly_Powered_Sensor_Networks_and_Computational_RFID","262056515_Ensuring_Survivability_of_Resource-Intensive_Sensor_Networks_Through_Ultra-Low_Power_Overlays","261859928_Analytic_comparison_of_wake-up_receivers_for_WSNs_and_benefits_over_the_wake-on_radio_scheme","261843872_Design_Development_and_Performance_Evaluation_of_a_Low-Cost_Low-Power_Wake-Up_Radio_System_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","261481586_A_98nW_wake-up_radio_for_wireless_body_area_networks","261122403_A_3-W_868-MHz_wake-up_receiver_with_-83_dBm_sensitivity_and_scalable_data_rate"]}
