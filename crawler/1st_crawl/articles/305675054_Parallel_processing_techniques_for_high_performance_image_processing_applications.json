{"id":"305675054_Parallel_processing_techniques_for_high_performance_image_processing_applications","abstract":"The complexity of many image processing applications and their stringent performance requirements have come to a point where they can no longer meet the real time deadlines, if implemented on conventional architectures based on a single general-purpose processor. Acceleration of these algorithms can be done by parallel computing. Parallelism can be accomplished both at hardware and software levels by various tools and methodologies. The various methods hence discussed prove to be helpful and thus a combination of both the custom hardware and software tool helps in speeding up the image processing algorithm. Different methodologies that can be used for parallel computation are discussed.","authors":["Monika Hemnani"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1109/SCEECS.2016.7509316","Conference: 2016 IEEE Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS)"],"references":["257310691_Parallel_Embedded_Processor_Architecture_for_FPGA_Based_Image_Processing_using_Parallel_Software_Skeletons","254014715_Analytical_study_of_parallel_and_distributed_image_processing","238367825_Using_MPI_Portable_Programming_with_the_Message_Passing_Interface","224483213_Some_computer_organizations_and_their_effectiveness_IEEE_Trans_Comput_C-21948","221457365_Design_space_exploration_for_FPGA-based_multiprocessing_systems","3226292_Systematic_and_Automated_Multiprocessor_System_Design_Programming_and_Implementation","2989747_Very_High-Speed_Computing_Systems","283490786_A_time-efficient_image_processing_algorithm_for_multicoremanycore_parallel_computing","275513889_Optimizing_Task_and_Data_Assignment_on_Multi-Core_Systems_with_Multi-Port_SPMs","272369608_Performance-Oriented_Partitioning_for_Task_Scheduling_of_Parallel_Reconfigurable_Architectures","262216780_Multi_MicroBlaze_system_for_parallel_computing","252029702_Fast_double-parallel_image_processing_based_on_FPGA","252001460_Accelerating_Multimedia_Applications_Using_Intel_Threading_Building_Blocks_on_Multi-Core_Processors","241008313_The_Use_of_PIMAGE_Library_for_Efficient_Image_Processing_in_a_Grid_Environment","239578400_Skjellum_using_mpi_portable_parallel_programming_with_the_message-passing_interface","235890195_Digital_Image_Processing","228083862_Digital_Image_Processing","226950868_MATLABR_a_language_for_parallel_computing","224127484_Multicore_Image_Processing_with_OpenMP","221437429_SoC-MPI_A_Flexible_Message_Passing_Library_for_Multiprocessor_Systems-on-Chips","221195834_Parallel_image_processing_based_on_CUDA","220695375_Advanced_Computer_Architecture_Parallelism_Scalability_Programmability","213877997_Scalable_Parallel_Programming_with_CUDA","2257721_Cilk_An_Efficient_Multithreaded_Runtime_System"]}
