{"id":"349644025_Scalable_distributed_gate-model_quantum_computers","abstract":"A scalable model for a distributed quantum computation is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the problem space provided by the diversity of possible quantum systems, from small-scale quantum devices to large-scale quantum computers. Here, we define a model of scalable distributed gate-model quantum computation in near-term quantum systems of the NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) technology era. We prove that the proposed architecture can maximize an objective function of a computational problem in a distributed manner. We study the impacts of decoherence on distributed objective function evaluation.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["February 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-76728-5"],"references":["347967440_Resource_prioritization_and_balancing_for_the_quantum_internet","347443328_Surpassing_the_classical_limit_in_magic_square_game_with_distant_quantum_dots_coupled_to_optical_cavities","347427245_A_Survey_on_Quantum_Key_Distribution","347177588_Efficient_Routing_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks","347177155_Capacity_Requirements_in_Networks_of_Quantum_Repeaters_and_Terminals","346313857_Wavepacket_phase-space_quantum_Monte_Carlo_method","348439430_Quantum_networking_with_short-range_entanglement_assistance","347823869_Designing_a_quantum_network_protocol","347050336_A_Derivative-Free_Method_for_Quantum_Perceptron_Training_in_Multi-layered_Neural_Networks","346257197_Hartree-Fock_on_a_superconducting_qubit_quantum_computer"]}
