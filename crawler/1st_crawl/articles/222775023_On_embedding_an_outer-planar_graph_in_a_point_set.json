{"id":"222775023_On_embedding_an_outer-planar_graph_in_a_point_set","abstract":"Given an n-vertex outer-planar graph G and a set P of n points in the plane, we present an O(nlog3n) time and O(n) space algorithm to compute a straight-line embedding of G in P, improving upon the algorithm in [8,12] that requires O(n2) time. Our algorithm is near-optimal as there is an lower bound for the problem [4]. We present a simpler O(nd) time and O(n) space algorithm to compute a straight-line embedding of G in P where logn⩽d⩽2n is the length of the longest vertex disjoint path in the dual of G. Therefore, the time complexity of the simpler algorithm varies between O(nlogn) and O(n2) depending on the value of d. More efficient algorithms are presented for certain restricted cases. If the dual of G is a path, then an optimal Θ(nlogn) time algorithm is presented. If the given point set is in convex position then we show that O(n) time suffices.","authors":["Prosenjit Bose"],"meta":["June 2002Computational Geometry 23(3):303-312","DOI:10.1016/S0925-7721(01)00069-4","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["223040356_Algorithms_for_Drawing_Graphs_An_Annotated_Bibliography","221557339_Proximity_Constraints_and_Representable_Trees","221557286_Optimal-Area_Upward_Drawings_of_AVL_Trees","220224488_Characterizing_Proximity_Trees","30508480_Proximity_Constraints_and_Representable_Trees_extended_abstract","316520040_Layout_of_rooted_trees","292020261_Introduction_to_Algorithms","279612851_E3341","271512783_Graph_Theory_and_Applications","265669370_Computational_Geometry_An_Introduction","244461852_Fast_detection_and_display_of_symmetry_in_trees","227249788_The_Realization_Problem_for_Euclidean_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_is_NP-Hard","226621879_Applications_of_a_semi-dynamic_convex_hull_algorithm","225116860_Transitions_in_geometric_minimum_spanning_trees","222454250_Maintenance_of_configurations_in_the_plane","222445006_Area_requirement_of_visibility_representations_of_trees","220991587_Straight_Line_Embeddings_of_Planar_Graphs_on_Point_Sets","220983203_Transitions_in_Geometric_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_Extended_Abstract","220983198_The_Realization_Problem_for_Euclidean_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_is_NP-hard","220452905_The_Rooted_Tree_Embedding_Problem_into_Points_in_the_Plane","37464985_Embedding_a_planar_triangulation_with_vertices_at_specified_points","3084191_On_the_Convex_Layers_of_a_Planar_Set","2627463_Optimal_Algorithms_to_Embed_Trees_in_a_Point_Set"]}
