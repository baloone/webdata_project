{"id":"314017824_An_Angularly_Stable_Dual-Band_FSS_with_Closely_Spaced_Resonances_Using_Miniaturized_Unit_Cell","abstract":"A novel miniaturized-element dual-band frequency selective surface (FSS) with closely spaced resonance is presented in this letter. The proposed FSS comprises of meander lines printed on a single-layer dielectric substrate to provide dual stopband characteristic. Compared to previously published spatial filters, the proposed FSS has better miniaturization characteristic having the unit-cell size of 0.065λ₀ x 0.065λ₀, where λ₀ corresponds to free space wavelength of the lower resonance frequency. In addition, the operating bands are closely located exhibiting the frequency ratio as low as 1.29. The surface current distribution and the equivalent circuit model are illustrated to explain the resonance behavior of the designed FSS. Furthermore, the proposed structure is polarization-independent and angularly stable for both TE and TM polarizations. A prototype of the dual-band FSS is fabricated and measured, which validates the simulated responses under normal and oblique incidence.","authors":["Saptarshi Ghosh","Kumar Vaibhav Srivastava"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters PP(99):1-3","DOI:10.1109/LMWC.2017.2661683"],"references":["279737790_Angularly_Stable_Frequency_Selective_Surface_With_Miniaturized_Unit_Cell","272944244_A_Novel_Dual_Band_Angular_Independent_FSS_With_Closely_Spaced_Frequency_Response","269726727_Compact_frequency_selective_surface_with_dual_band_response_for_WLAN_application","268006521_Dual-band_frequency_selective_surface_with_miniaturized_element_in_low_frequencies","262343745_A_miniaturized_dual-band_FSS_with_stable_resonance_frequencies_of_24_GHz5_GHz_for_WLAN_applications","258788854_A_Dual-Frequency_Miniaturized-Element_FSS_With_Closely_Located_Resonances","224353305_Dual-Band_Capacitive_Loaded_Frequency_Selective_Surfaces_With_Close_Band_Spacing","224351958_Multipole_Spatial_Filters_Using_Metamaterial-Based_Miniaturized-Element_Frequency-Selective_Surfaces","224092491_A_Miniaturized_Dual-Band_Frequency_Selective_Surface_FSS_With_Closed_Loop_and_Its_Complementary_Pattern","3019132_A_Frequency_Selective_Surface_With_Miniaturized_Elements"]}
