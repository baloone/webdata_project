{"id":"317618056_Programming_video_games_and_simulations_in_science_education_exploring_computational_thinking_through_code_analysis","abstract":"Various aspects of computational thinking (CT) could be supported by educational contexts such as simulations and video-games construction. In this field study, potential differences in student motivation and learning were empirically examined through students’ code. For this purpose, we performed a teaching intervention that took place over five weeks, with two-hour sessions per week, plus two more weeks for the pretest and post-test projects. Students were taught programming concepts through a science project; one group represented the function of a basic electric circuit by creating a simulation, while the other group represented the same function by creating a video game in which a player should achieve a score in order to win. Video game construction resulted in projects with higher CT skills and more primitives, as measured through projects’ code analysis. Moreover, the video-game context seems to better motivate students for future engagement with computing activities.","authors":["Varvara Garneli","Konstantinos Chorianopoulos"],"meta":["June 2017Interactive Learning Environments","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2017.1337036"],"references":["303919832_The_need_to_report_effect_size_estimates_revisited_An_overview_of_some_recommended_measures_of_effect_size","301701335_Serious_games_as_a_malleable_learning_medium_The_effects_of_narrative_gameplay_and_making_on_students'_performance_and_attitudes","290391277_COMPUTATIONAL_THINKING_TEST_DESIGN_GUIDELINES_AND_CONTENT_VALIDATION","284432790_Harnessing_Values_to_Promote_Motivation_in_Education","274377900_Computational_Thinking","321549703_Building_autonomous_learners_Perspectives_from_research_and_practice_using_self-determination_theory","301246842_Optimizing_Students'_Motivation_in_the_Era_of_Testing_and_Pressure_A_Self-Determination_Theory_Perspective","301246766_Understanding_Motivation_in_Education_Theoretical_and_Practical_Considerations","298972479_Learning_Computer_Science_Concepts_with_Scratch","287391362_Learner-Centered_Design_of_Computing_Education_Research_on_Computing_for_Everyone"]}
