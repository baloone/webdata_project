{"id":"44807074_Software_survey_VOSviewer_a_computer_program_for_bibliometric_mapping","abstract":"We present VOSviewer, a freely available computer program that we have developed for constructing and viewing bibliometric maps. Unlike most computer programs that are used for bibliometric mapping, VOSviewer pays special attention to the graphical representation of bibliometric maps. The functionality of VOSviewer is especially useful for displaying large bibliometric maps in an easy-to-interpret way. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part, an overview of VOSviewer's functionality for displaying bibliometric maps is provided. In the second part, the technical implementation of specific parts of the program is discussed. Finally, in the third part, VOSviewer's ability to handle large maps is demonstrated by using the program to construct and display a co-citation map of 5,000 major scientific journals.","authors":["Nees Jan van Eck","Ludo Waltman"],"meta":["August 2010Scientometrics 84(2):523-538","DOI:10.1007/s11192-009-0146-3","SourcePubMed"],"references":["247572321_Software_for_Social_Network_Analysis","242915743_Co-word_Maps_of_Biotechnology_An_Example_of_Cognitive_Scientometrics","222457525_Graph_theoretic_foundations_of_Pathfinder_networks","220434094_Science_and_Technology_Mapping_A_New_Iteration_Model_for_Representing_Multidimensional_Relationships","220365101_Quantitative_evaluation_of_large_maps_of_science","220365044_Mapping_the_Backbone_of_Science","45888552_Clusters_and_Maps_of_Science_Journals_Based_on_Bi-Connected_Graphs_in_Journal_Citation_Reports","45882658_A_Global_Map_of_Science_Based_on_the_ISI_subject_categories","28674282_CiteSpace_II_Detecting_and_visualizing_emerging_trends_and_transient_patterns_in_scientific_literature","24192309_Clickstream_Data_Yields_High-Resolution_Maps_of_Science","8667437_Enhancing_scatterplots_with_smoothed_densities","3410979_GraphSplatting_Visualizing_Graphs_as_Continuous_Fields","2474428_Cluster_Stability_and_the_Use_of_Noise_in_Interpretation_of_Clustering","263964245_Modern_Multidimensional_Scaling_Theory_and_Applications","252131464_Multivariate_Density_Estimation_Theory","242915618_Clustering_the_science_citation_indexR_using_co-citations_-_I_A_comparison_of_methods","240959781_Visualizing_the_Computational_Intelligence_Field","227534888_Visualizing_the_Marrow_of_Science","226813500_Shadows_of_the_Past_in_International_Cooperation_Collaboration_Profiles_of_the_Top_Five_Producers_of_Science","221649604_VOS_A_New_Method_for_Visualizing_Similarities_Between_Objects","220695123_Visualizing_the_Structure_of_Science","220434717_Identifying_a_better_measure_of_relatedness_for_mapping_science","220434462_Requirements_for_a_cocitation_similarity_measure_with_special_reference_to_Pearson's_correlation_coefficient","220433909_Pathfinder_Networks_and_Author_Cocitation_Analysis_A_Remapping_of_Paradigmatic_Information_Scientists","220432916_How_to_Normalize_Cooccurrence_Data_An_Analysis_of_Some_Well-Known_Similarity_Measures","220354839_Bibliometric_Mapping_of_the_Computational_Intelligence_Field","220281986_Graph_Drawing_by_Force-Directed_Placement","220142026_Visualizing_Knowledge_Domains","220112953_An_Algorithm_for_Drawing_General_Undirected_Graphs","220065987_From_the_science_of_science_to_Scientometrics_visualizing_the_history_of_science_with_HistCite_software","200772533_Exploratory_Social_Network_Analysis_With_Pajek","42109833_'Automatic_Term_Identification_for_Bibliometric_Mapping'","8884396_The_World_of_Geography_Visualizing_a_Knowledge_Domain_with_Cartographic_Means","4928096_Co-word-based_science_maps_of_chemical_engineering_Part_I_Representations_by_direct_multidimensional_scaling","3455517_Visualizing_the_Computational_Intelligence_Field"]}
