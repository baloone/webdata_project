{"id":"312569109_Optimization_of_radar_search_patterns_for_multiple_scanning_missions_in_localized_clutter","abstract":"Electronic Phased-Array Radars offer new possibilities for Optimization of Radar Search Pattern by using bi-dimensional beam forming and beam steering, along both elevation and azimuth axes. The minimization of the Time-Budget required for multiple Radar scanning missions in localized clutter, under constraints of range and detection probability, can be approximated as a Set Cover Problem. We present a Set Cover Problem approximation for Time-Budget minimization of the Radar Search Pattern, and solved this optimization problem using Integer Programming methods based on Branch&Bound and linear relaxation.","authors":["Yann Briheche","Frederic Barbaresco","Fouad Bennis","Damien Charles Chablat"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/CAMA.2016.7815761","Conference: 2016 IEEE Conference on Antenna Measurements & Applications (CAMA)","Project: Radar Resource Management"],"references":["304458082_Non-uniform_constrained_optimization_of_radar_search_patterns_in_direction_cosines_space_using_integer_programming","282836214_Scalable_Alternating_Projection_and_Proximal_Splitting_for_Array_Pattern_Synthesis","254894355_Phase-only_and_amplitude-phase_only_synthesis_of_dual-beam_pattern_linear_antenna_arrays_using_floating-point_genetic_algorithms","312774427_Integer_Programming_Models","282380648_Radar_tasks_scheduling_for_a_multifunction_phased_array_radar_with_hard_time_constraint_and_priority","273001794_Approximation_Algorithms","264679229_Radar_Handbook_Third_Edition","260613928_Electromagnetic_waves_and_the_ether","255731228_Search_Optimization_for_Minimum_Load_under_Detection_Performance_Constraints_in_Multifunction_Radars","234826451_Packing_to_angles_and_sectors"]}
