{"id":"265386034_Isoperimetric_Inequalities_for_Ramanujan_Complexes_and_Topological_Expanders","abstract":"Expander graphs have been intensively studied in the last four decades (Hoory et al., Bull Am Math Soc, 43(4):439–562, 2006; Lubotzky, Bull Am Math\nSoc, 49:113–162, 2012). In recent years a high dimensional theory of expanders has emerged, and several variants have been studied. Among them stand out coboundary expansion and topological expansion. It is known that for every d there are unbounded degree simplicial complexes of dimension d with these properties. However, a major open problem, formulated by Gromov (Geom Funct Anal 20(2):416–526, 2010), is whether bounded degree high dimensional expanders exist for \\({d \\geq 2}\\). We present an explicit construction of bounded degree complexes of dimension \\({d = 2}\\) which are topological expanders, thus answering Gromov’s question in the affirmative. Conditional on a conjecture of Serre on the congruence subgroup property, infinite sub-family of these give also a family of bounded degree coboundary expanders. The main technical tools are new isoperimetric inequalities for Ramanujan Complexes. We prove linear size bounds on \\({\\mathbb{F}_2}\\) systolic invariants of these complexes, which seem to be the first linear\n\\({\\mathbb{F}_2}\\) systolic bounds. The expansion results are deduced from these isoperimetric inequalities.","authors":["Tali Kaufman","David Kazhdan","Alexander Lubotzky"],"meta":["February 2016Geometric and Functional Analysis 26(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00039-016-0362-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278413824_On_Expansion_and_Topological_Overlap","265128061_Ramanujan_Complexes_and_Bounded_Degree_Topological_Expanders","264385377_Mixing_Properties_and_the_Chromatic_Number_of_Ramanujan_Complexes","264197629_Expansion_of_Building-Like_Complexes","259212197_High_Dimensional_Expanders_and_Property_Testing","303901533_Bounded_degree_cosystolic_expanders_of_every_dimension","266421310_Z_2_-systolic_freedom_and_quantum_codes","265995303_Discrete_groups_expanding_graphs_and_invariant_measures_With_an_appendix_by_Jonathan_D_Rogawski_Reprint_of_the_1994_original","265447611_A_generalization_of_Caratheodory's_theorem","265427016_Expander_graphs_and_their_application"]}
