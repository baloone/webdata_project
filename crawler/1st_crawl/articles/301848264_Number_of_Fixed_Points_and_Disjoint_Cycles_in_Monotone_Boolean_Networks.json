{"id":"301848264_Number_of_Fixed_Points_and_Disjoint_Cycles_in_Monotone_Boolean_Networks","abstract":"Given a digraph $G$, a lot of attention has been deserved on the maximum number $\\phi(G)$ of fixed points in a Boolean network $f:\\{0,1\\}^n\\to\\{0,1\\}^n$ with $G$ as interaction graph. In particular, a central problem in network coding consists in studying the optimality of the classical upper bound $\\phi(G)\\leq 2^{\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the minimum size of a feedback vertex set of $G$. In this paper, we study the maximum number $\\phi_m(G)$ of fixed points in a {\\em monotone} Boolean network with interaction graph $G$. We establish new upper and lower bounds on $\\phi_m(G)$ that depends on the cycle structure of $G$. In addition to $\\tau$, the involved parameters are the maximum number $\\nu$ of vertex-disjoint cycles, and the maximum number $\\nu^{*}$ of vertex-disjoint cycles verifying some additional technical conditions. We improve the classical upper bound $2^\\tau$ by proving that $\\phi_m(G)$ is at most the largest sub-lattice of $\\{0,1\\}^\\tau$ without chain of size $\\nu+1$, and without another forbidden-pattern of size $2\\nu^{*}$. Then, we prove two optimal lower bounds: $\\phi_m(G)\\geq \\nu+1$ and $\\phi_m(G)\\geq 2^{\\nu^{*}}$. As a consequence, we get the following characterization: $\\phi_m(G)=2^\\tau$ if and only if $\\nu^{*}=\\tau$. As another consequence, we get that if $c$ is the maximum length of a chordless cycle of $G$ then $2^{\\nu/3^c}\\leq\\phi_m(G)\\leq 2^{c\\nu}$. Finally, with the technics introduced, we establish an upper bound on the number of fixed points of any Boolean network according to its signed interaction graph.","authors":["Julio Aracena","Adrien Richard","Lilian Salinas"],"meta":["February 2016SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 31(3)","DOI:10.1137/16M1060868"],"references":["272083794_Quantitative_and_logic_modelling_of_molecular_and_gene_networks","269721988_Reduction_and_Fixed_Points_of_Boolean_Networks_and_Linear_Network_Coding_Solvability","265966975_Fixed_Points_of_Boolean_Networks_Guessing_Graphs_and_Coding_Theory","239067014_A_Mathematical_Bibliography_of_Signed_and_Gain_Graphs_and_Allied_Areas","237719478_Two-Part_and_k_-Sperner_Families_New_Proofs_Using_Permutations","224643410_Information_flows_graphs_and_their_guessing_numbers","220441990_Packing_Directed_Circuits","47397023_Graph-Theoretical_Constructions_for_Graph_Entropy_and_Network_Coding_Based_Communications","37811275_The_Origins_of_Order_Self-Organization_and_Selection_in_Evolution","10732809_Multistationarity_the_basis_of_cell_differentiation_and_memory_II_Logical_analysis_of_regulatory_networks_in_terms_of_feedback_circuits","328554450_Neural_networks_and_physical_systems_with_emergent_collective_computational_abilities","320181465_The_origins_of_order_self-organization_and_selection_in_evolution","303125726_A_logical_calculus_of_the_ideas_immanent_in_nervous_activity","292215395_Neural_networks_and_physical_systems_with_emergent_collective_computational_abilities","288233308_Boolean_formalisation_of_genetic_control_circuits","281331014_Biological_Feedback","261715993_Maximum_number_of_fixed_points_in_AND-OR-NOT_networks","253257695_Boolean_modeling_of_cellular_regulatory_networks","248603444_Metabolic_stability_and_epigenesis_in_randomly_constructed_genetic_J","243770271_Discrete_Iterations_A_Metric_Study","243070439_On_a_Lemma_of_Littlewood_and_Offord","242619830_Fundamentals_of_Domination_in_Graphs","232346487_Signed_graphs","229461736_On_the_Measurement_of_Structural_Balance","229450062_On_the_presence_of_disjoint_subgraphs_of_a_specified_type","228397698_Domination_in_digraphs","226020836_Boolean_Modelingof_Genetic_Regulatory_Networks","225144510_A_Logical_Calculus_of_the_Idea_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity","222578735_Graphic_requirements_for_multistability_and_attractive_cycles_in_a_Boolean_dynamical_framework","221569504_Intercyclic_digraphs","220682991_Network_Information_Flow","220442059_Packing_Directed_Circuits_Fractionally","220342840_Information_Flows_Graphs_and_their_Guessing_Numbers","51394097_Boolean_Network_Models_of_Cellular_Regulation_Prospects_and_Limitations","48166544_Packing_directed_circuits_exactly","18578234_Boolean_formalization_of_genetic_control_circuits","17383444_Metabolic_Stability_and_Epigenisis_in_Randomly_Connected_Genetic_Nets","5545418_Maximum_Number_of_Fixed_Points_in_Regulatory_Boolean_Networks"]}
