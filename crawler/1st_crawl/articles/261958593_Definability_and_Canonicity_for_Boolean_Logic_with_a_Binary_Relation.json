{"id":"261958593_Definability_and_Canonicity_for_Boolean_Logic_with_a_Binary_Relation","abstract":"This paper studies the concepts of definability and canonicity in Boolean logic with a binary relation. Firstly, it provides formulas defining first-order or second-order conditions on frames. Secondly, it proves that all formulas corresponding to compatible first-order conditions on frames are canonical.","authors":["Philippe Balbiani","Tinko Tinchev"],"meta":["October 2014Fundamenta Informaticae 129(4):301-327","DOI:10.3233/FI-2014-973"],"references":["330422421_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","330422329_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","330422013_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_A_Proximity_Approach-I","226341313_Region-Based_Theory_of_Space_Algebras_of_Regions_Representation_Theory_and_Logics","220642992_Region-based_theory_of_discrete_spaces_A_proximity_approach","220444929_Qualitative_Spatial_Representation_and_Reasoning_An_Overview","220443747_Modal_Logics_for_Region-based_Theories_of_Space","220202763_A_Proximity_Approach_to_Some_Region-Based_Theories_of_Space","220202565_Dynamic_logics_of_the_region-based_theory_of_discrete_spaces","38355098_Connection_Structures_Grzegorczyk's_and_Whitehead's_Definitions_of_Point","2454980_On_the_Decision_Problem_for_Two-Variable_First-Order_Logic","301698668_Axiomatic_classes_in_propositional_modal_logic_in_Algebra_and_Logic_Springer","285350971_Point_line_and_surface_as_sets_of_solids","279347630_Universal_Algebra_for_Computer_Scientists","268546805_Sahlqvist_theorems_for_precontact_logics","259810779_Modal_Logic","245578421_Axiomatization_of_geometry_without_points","229710549_On_languages_with_two_variables","227125282_Axiomatic_classes_in_propositional_modal_logic","226328794_Axiomatizability_of_Geometry_without_Points","222681756_A_relation_-_Algebraic_approach_to_the_region_connection_calculus","222410062_A_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_contact_algebras","221600684_The_Mereotopology_of_Discrete_Space","220706041_The_Truth_About_Algorithmic_Problems_in_Correspondence_Theory","220546826_Boolean_Connection_Algebras_A_New_Approach_to_the_Region-Connection_Calculus","220315423_A_New_Proof_of_Sahlqvist's_Theorem_on_Modal_Definability_and_Completeness","220118021_Boolean_Logics_with_Relations","38355951_A_Calculus_of_Individuals_Based_on_'Connection","35631516_Completeness_and_Correspondence_in_the_First_and_Second_Order_Semantics_for_Modal_Logic","31028940_Definability_Over_the_Class_of_all_Partitions"]}
