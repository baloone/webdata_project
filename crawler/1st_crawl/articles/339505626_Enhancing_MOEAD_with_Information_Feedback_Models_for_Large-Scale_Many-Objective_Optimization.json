{"id":"339505626_Enhancing_MOEAD_with_Information_Feedback_Models_for_Large-Scale_Many-Objective_Optimization","abstract":"A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is a classic decomposition-based multi-objective optimization algorithm. In the standard MOEA/D algorithm, the update process of individuals is a forward search process without using the information of previous individuals. However, there is a lot of useful information in the previous iteration. Information Feedback Models (IFM) is a new strategy which can incorporate the information from previous iteration into the updating process. Therefore, this paper proposes a MOEA/D algorithm based on information feedback model, called MOEA/D-IFM. According to the different information feedback models, this paper proposes six variants of MOEA/D, and these algorithms can be divided into two categories according to the way of selecting individuals whether it is random or fixed. At the same time, a new selection strategy has been introduced to further improve the performance of MOEA/D-IFM. The experiments were carried out in four aspects. MOEA/D-IFM were compared with other state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms using CEC 2018 problems in two aspects. The best one of the six improved algorithms was chosen to test on large-scale many-objective problems. In addition, we also use MOEA/D-IFM to solve multi-objective backpack problems.","authors":["Yin Zhang","Gai-Ge Wang","Keqin Li","Wei-Chang Yeh"],"meta":["February 2020Information Sciences 522(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2020.02.066"],"references":["324836074_An_improved_MOEAD_design_for_many-objective_optimization_problems","320944800_openGA_a_C_Genetic_Algorithm_library","316525617_Adjust_weight_vectors_in_MOEAD_for_bi-objective_optimization_problems_with_discontinuous_Pareto_fronts","315446832_A_benchmark_test_suite_for_evolutionary_many-objective_optimization","306058104_Test_Problems_for_Large-Scale_Multiobjective_and_Many-Objective_Optimization","303380956_Diversity_Assessment_in_Many-Objective_Optimization","291337172_A_Self-Organizing_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm","289825861_A_Reference_Vector_Guided_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Many-Objective_Optimization","270723368_A_New_Local_Search-Based_Multiobjective_Optimization_Algorithm","269275405_A_Knee_Point_Driven_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Many-Objective_Optimization","260534964_MOEAD-ACO_A_multiobjective_evolutionary_algorithm_using_decomposition_and_AntColony","236030354_Krill_Herd_Algorithm_A_New_Bio-Inspired_Optimization_Algorithm","233780272_Bat_Algorithm_A_Novel_Approach_for_Global_Engineering_Optimization","227242104_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_Global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","224309395_Biogeography-Based_Optimization","224105880_Cuckoo_Search_via_Levey_Flights","45904981_Cuckoo_Search_via_Levy_Flights","333596583_A_New_Resource_Allocation_Strategy_Based_on_the_Relationship_Between_Subproblems_for_MOEAD","328898243_A_Cost_Value_Based_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_with_Neighbor_Selection_Strategy","328194593_Behavior_of_Crossover_Operators_in_NSGA-III_for_Large-Scale_Optimization_Problems","326003908_Multiobjective_and_Interactive_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Weight_Tuning_of_a_Model_Predictive_Control-Based_Motion_Cueing_Algorithm","325604897_An_Improved_NSGA-III_Algorithm_with_Adaptive_Mutation_Operator_for_Big_Data_Optimization_Problems","323000881_Deep_swarm_Nested_particle_swarm_optimization","322015891_Improving_Metaheuristic_Algorithms_With_Information_Feedback_Models","321466977_Enhancing_robustness_of_the_inverted_PBI_scalarizing_method_in_MOEAD","320458244_A_Competitive_Mechanism_Based_Multi-objective_Particle_Swarm_Optimizer_with_Fast_Convergence","315889273_On_the_effect_of_reference_point_in_MOEAD_for_multi-objective_optimization","313705486_RM-MEDA_A_regularity_model_based_multiobjective_estimation_of_distribution_algorithm","311732969_Muiltiobjective_optimization_using_nondominated_sorting_in_genetic_algorithms","305001282_A_Vector_Angle-Based_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Unconstrained_Many-Objective_Optimization","304425270_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","291556254_Decomposition_Based_Algorithms_Using_Pareto_Adaptive_Scalarizing_Methods","284819362_Improved_probabilistic_neural_networks_with_self-Adaptive_strategies_for_transformer_fault_diagnosis_problem","281717598_A_double-module_immune_algorithm_for_multi-objective_optimization_problems","281266055_No_Free_Lunch_Theorems_for_Optimization","279274771_No_free_lunch_theorems_for_optimization","275964443_Monarch_Butterfly_Optimization","274317736_Adaptive_replacement_strategies_for_MOEAD","273296140_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Based_on_Dominance_and_Decomposition","272205267_Path_Planning_for_Uninhabited_Combat_Aerial_Vehicle_Using_Hybrid_Meta-Heuristic_DEBBO_Algorithm","272031116_MOEAD_with_uniform_decomposition_measurement_for_many-objective_problems","265470412_MOEAD_with_opposition-based_learning_for_multiobjective_optimization_problem","264427657_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Using_Reference-Point_Based_Nondominated_Sorting_Approach_Part_II_Handling_Constraints_and_Extending_to_an_Adaptive_Approach","264387359_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Using_Reference-Point-Based_Nondominated_Sorting_Approach_Part_I_Solving_Problems_With_Box_Constraints","262147119_Chaotic_Krill_Herd_algorithm","257868174_Test-Sheet_Composition_Using_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_and_Hybrid_Metaheuristic_Algorithm_TSBBO","256721148_A_modification_to_MOEAD-DE_for_multiobjective_optimization_problems_with_complicated_Pareto_sets","242919220_Muiltiobjective_Optimization_Using_Nondominated_Sorting_in_Genetic_Algorithms","230681861_A_Multi-Objective_Artificial_Bee_Colony_Algorithm","221999457_Blended_biogeography-based_optimization_for_constrained_optimization","3810360_Ant_colony_optimization_A_new_meta-heuristic","3419010_RM-MEDA_A_Regularity_Model-Based_Multiobjective_Estimation_of_Distribution_Algorithm","3418989_MOEAD_A_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition","3623274_Particle_swarm_Optimization","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II"]}
