{"id":"357634394_Survey_Paper_on_about_Computability","abstract":"Computability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, computer science, and the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, computability theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory.","authors":["Abdelaziz Daoud"],"meta":["November 2021Computability"],"references":[]}
