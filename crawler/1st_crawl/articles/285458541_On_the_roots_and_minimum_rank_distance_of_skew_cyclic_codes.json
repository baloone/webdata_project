{"id":"285458541_On_the_roots_and_minimum_rank_distance_of_skew_cyclic_codes","abstract":"Skew cyclic codes play the same role as cyclic codes in the theory of\nerror-correcting codes for the rank metric. In this paper, we give descriptions\nof these codes by idempotent generators, root spaces and cyclotomic spaces. We\nprove that the lattice of skew cyclic codes is anti-isomorphic to the lattice\nof root spaces and extend the rank-BCH bound on their minimum rank distance to\nrank-metric versions of the van Lint-Wilson's shift and Hartmann-Tzeng bounds.\nFinally, we study skew cyclic codes which are linear over the base field,\nproving that these codes include all classical cyclic codes equipped with the\nHamming metric.","authors":["Umberto Martínez-Peñas"],"meta":["June 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 83(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0262-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278332459_On_the_similarities_between_rank_and_Hamming_weights_and_their_applications_to_network_coding","249673909_The_shift_bound_for_cyclic_Reed-Muller_and_geometric_Goppa_codes","279768377_Construction_of_skew_cyclic_codes_over_mathbb_F_qvmathbb_F_q","276132492_Rank-metric_codes_and_their_duality_theory","266282029_Generalizations_of_the_BCH_bound","263967767_Rank_weight_hierarchy_of_some_classes_of_cyclic_codes","246995074_On_a_Special_Class_of_Polynomials","246193402_Finite_Fields_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics","242619135_Theory_of_Non-Commutative_Polynomials","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes"]}
