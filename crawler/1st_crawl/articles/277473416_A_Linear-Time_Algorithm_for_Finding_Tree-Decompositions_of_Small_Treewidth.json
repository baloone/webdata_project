{"id":"277473416_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Small_Treewidth","abstract":"In this paper, we give, for constant k, a linear time algorithm, that given a graph G = (V, E), determines whether the treewidth of G is at most k, and if so, finds a tree-decomposition of G with treewidth at most k. A consequence is that every minor-closed class of graphs that does not contain all planar graphs has a linear time recognition algorithm.","authors":["Hans L.
