{"id":"332848250_The_seeding_algorithms_for_spherical_k-means_clustering","abstract":"In order to cluster the textual data with high dimension in modern data analysis, the spherical k-means clustering is presented. It aims to partition the given points with unit length into k sets so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of cosine dissimilarity. In this paper, we mainly study seeding algorithms for spherical k-means clustering, for its special case (with separable sets), as well as for its generalized problem (\\(\\alpha \\)-spherical k-means clustering). About the spherical k-means clustering with separable sets, an approximate algorithm with a constant factor is presented. Moreover, it can be generalized to the \\(\\alpha \\)-spherical separable k-means clustering. By slickly constructing a useful function, we also show that the famous seeding algorithms such as k-means++ and k-means|| for k-means problem can be applied directly to solve the \\(\\alpha \\)-spherical k-means clustering. Except for theoretical analysis, the numerical experiment is also included.","authors":["Min Li","Dachuan Xu","Dongmei Zhang","Juan Zou"],"meta":["April 2020Journal of Global Optimization 76(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10898-019-00779-w"],"references":["311900754_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","283428234_Spherical_k-Means_Clustering","263534218_Clustering_Large_Graphs_via_the_Singular_Value_Decomposition_Theoretical_Advances_in_Data_Clustering_Guest_Editors_Nina_Mishra_and_Rajeev_Motwani","321066393_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","310515572_Theoretical_Analysis_of_the_k-Means_Algorithm_-_A_Survey","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","305092466_The_effectiveness_of_lloyd-type_methods_for_the_k-means_problem","290130612_Spherical_k-Means_Clustering","281487160_Improved_and_Simplified_Inapproximability_for_k-means","272194462_The_Hardness_of_Approximation_of_Euclidean_k-means"]}
