{"id":"3735424_The_NICE_project_Learning_together_in_a_virtual_world","abstract":"This paper describes the NICE project, an immersive learning environment for children implemented in the CAVE and related multi-user virtual reality (VR) technologies. The NICE project provides an engaging setting where children construct and cultivate simple virtual ecosystems, collaborate via networks with other remotely-located children, and create stories from their interactions in the real and virtual world.","authors":["Andrew Edward Johnson","Maria Roussou","Jason Leigh","Christina Vasilakis,"],"meta":["February 1998","DOI:10.1109/VRAIS.1998.658487","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Virtual Reality Annual International Symposium, 1998.
