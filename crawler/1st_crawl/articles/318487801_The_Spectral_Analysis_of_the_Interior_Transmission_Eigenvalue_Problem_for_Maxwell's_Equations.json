{"id":"318487801_The_Spectral_Analysis_of_the_Interior_Transmission_Eigenvalue_Problem_for_Maxwell's_Equations","abstract":"In this paper we consider the transmission eigenvalue problem for Maxwell's equations corresponding to non-magnetic inhomogeneities with contrast in electric permittivity that has fixed sign (only) in a neighborhood of the boundary. We study this problem in the framework of semiclassical analysis and relate the transmission eigenvalues to the spectrum of a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. Under the additional assumption that the contrast is constant in a neighborhood of the boundary, we prove that the set of transmission eigenvalues is discrete, infinite and without finite accumulation points. A notion of generalized eigenfunctions is introduced and a denseness result is obtained in an appropriate solution space.","authors":["Houssem Haddar","Shixu Meng"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1016/j.matpur.2018.10.004"],"references":["277603181_Boundary_Integral_Equations_for_the_Transmission_Eigenvalue_Problem_for_Maxwell_Equations","265635031_Transmission_Eigenvalues_in_Inverse_Scattering_Theory","316807526_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Time-Harmonic_Maxwell's_Equations","281262970_On_the_existence_of_transmission_eigenvalues","274238993_Lectures_on_Elliptic_Boundary_Value_Problems","272386305_Inside-Outside_Duality_and_the_Determination_of_Electromagnetic_Interior_Transmission_Eigenvalues","267678259_Surface_integral_formulation_of_the_interior_transmission_problem","267434648_A_Qualitative_Approach_to_Inverse_Scattering_Theory","267076334_Semiclassical_Analysis","266836997_Pseudo-differential_operators_and_the_Nash-Moser_theorem_Transl_from_the_French_by_Stephen_S_Wilson"]}
