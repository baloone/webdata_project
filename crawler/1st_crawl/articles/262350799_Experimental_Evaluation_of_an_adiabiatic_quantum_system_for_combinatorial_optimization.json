{"id":"262350799_Experimental_Evaluation_of_an_adiabiatic_quantum_system_for_combinatorial_optimization","abstract":"This paper describes an experimental study of a novel computing system (algorithm plus platform) that carries out quantum annealing, a type of adiabatic quantum computation, to solve optimization problems. We compare this system to three conventional software solvers, using instances from three NP-hard problem domains. We also describe experiments to learn how performance of the quantum annealing algorithm depends on input.","authors":["Catherine Mcgeoch","Cong Wang"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1145/2482767.2482797","Conference: Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers"],"references":["268356189_NEW_ALGORITHMS_FOR_QUADRATIC_UNCONSTRAINED_BINARY_OPTIMIZATION_QUBO_WITH_APPLICATIONS_IN_ENGINEERING_AND_SOCIAL_SCIENCES","262160798_How_Powerful_is_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computation","261363405_Experimental_Determination_of_Ramsey_Numbers","243967652_Experimental_sigNature_of_programmable_quantum_annealing","230666631_Finding_low-energy_conformations_of_lattice_protein_models_by_quantum_annealing","51945288_Spectral_Gap_Amplification","51117464_Quantum_annealing_with_manufactured_spins","50397443_Does_Adiabatic_Quantum_Optimization_Fail_for_NP-Complete_Problems","45874715_Quantum_Adiabatic_Algorithms_Small_Gaps_and_Different_Paths","45874270_Experimental_Demonstration_of_a_Robust_and_Scalable_Flux_Qubit","45868134_Adiabatic_quantum_optimization_fails_for_random_instances_of_NP-complete_problems","12423758_Quantum_superposition_of_distinct_macroscopic_states","12020333_A_Quantum_Adiabatic_Evolution_Algorithm_Applied_to_Random_Instances_of_an_NP-Complete_Problem","11440829_Theory_of_Quantum_Annealing_of_an_Ising_Spin_Glass","4109376_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computation_is_Equivalent_to_Standard_Quantum_Computation","2192826_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computation_Is_Equivalent_to_Standard_Quantum_Computation","2186534_Robustness_of_adiabatic_quantum_computation","1885803_Realizable_Hamiltonians_for_Universal_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computers","265405793_LIMITS_ON_QUANTUM_ADIABATIC_OPTIMIZATION_WARNING_ROUGH_MANUSCRIPT","225269997_Local_search_heuristics_for_Quadratic_Unconstrained_Binary_Optimization_QUBO","225230065_Beweis_des_Adiabatensatzes","45911746_Adiabatic_Quantum_Algorithms_for_the_NP-Complete_Maximum-Weight_Independent_Set_Exact_Cover_and_3SAT_Problems","13076360_Quantum_Annealing_of_a_Disordered_Magnet","2201607_Fast_quantum_mechanical_algorithm_for_database_search","2184710_A_Numerical_Study_of_the_Performance_of_a_Quantum_Adiabatic_Evolution_Algorithm_for_Satisfiability","2184005_Quantum_Computation_by_Adiabatic_Evolution","1921740_Minor-Embedding_in_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computation_I_The_Parameter_Setting_Problem"]}
