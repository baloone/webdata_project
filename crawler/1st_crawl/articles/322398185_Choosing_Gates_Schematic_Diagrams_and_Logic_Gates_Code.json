{"id":"322398185_Choosing_Gates_Schematic_Diagrams_and_Logic_Gates_Code","abstract":"Schematic diagrams that express an output depending on the design and inputs involved. These logic gates have 3 or more inputs and an output. The first input is for the choice and the next inputs are for the choices. Other variations of the choosing gates may be established. Polygons are the symbols for the choosing gates: diamond for three inputs, pentagon for four inputs, hexagon for five inputs stage so on and so forth. A line is connected per vertex to represent inputs and outputs. This be used in logic, computer science and electrical and electronics industry. Also, in addition, there is an optional code that will perform a specified logic operation.","authors":["Ismael Fortunado"],"meta":["December 2016","Project: Engineering"],"references":[]}
