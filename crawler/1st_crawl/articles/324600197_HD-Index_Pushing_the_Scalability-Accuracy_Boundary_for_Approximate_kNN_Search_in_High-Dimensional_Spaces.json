{"id":"324600197_HD-Index_Pushing_the_Scalability-Accuracy_Boundary_for_Approximate_kNN_Search_in_High-Dimensional_Spaces","abstract":"Nearest neighbor searching of large databases in high-dimensional spaces is inherently difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. A flavor of approximation is, therefore, necessary to practically solve the problem of nearest neighbor search. In this paper, we propose a novel yet simple indexing scheme, HD-Index, to solve the problem of approximate k-nearest neighbor queries in massive high-dimensional databases. HD-Index consists of a set of novel hierarchical structures called RDB-trees built on Hilbert keys of database objects. The leaves of the RDB-trees store distances of database objects to reference objects, thereby allowing efficient pruning using distance filters. In addition to triangular inequality, we also use Ptolemaic inequality to produce better lower bounds. Experiments on massive (up to billion scale) high-dimensional (up to 1000+) datasets show that HD-Index is effective, efficient, and scalable.","authors":["Akhil Arora","Sakshi Sinha","Piyush Kumar","Arnab Bhattacharya"],"meta":["April 2018Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 11(8)","DOI:10.14778/3204028.3204034"],"references":["305355740_Query-Aware_locality-sensitive_hashing_for_approximate_nearest_neighbor_search","301837503_Efficient_and_Robust_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Search_Using_Hierarchical_Navigable_Small_World_Graphs","319770468_Approximate_similarity_search_in_metric_spaces_using_inverted_files","319770399_Approximate_nearest_neighbors_towards_removing_the_curse_of_dimensionality","313748664_The_SR-tree_An_index_structure_for_high-dimensional_nearest_neighbor_queries","313708771_The_R-tree_An_efficient_and_robust_access_method_for_points_and_rectangles","307452158_Fundamentals_of_Database_Indexing_and_Searching","286894182_SK-LSH_An_efficient_index_structure_for_approximate_nearest_neighbor_search","282837502_Efficient_metric_indexing_for_similarity_search","280743570_SRS_Solving_c-approximate_nearest_neighbor_queries_in_high_dimensional_Euclidean_space_with_a_tiny_index"]}
