{"id":"260340661_Region-Based_Approximation_of_Probability_Distributions_for_Visibility_Between_Imprecise_Points_Among_Obstacles","abstract":"Let $p$ and $q$ be two imprecise points, given as probability density\nfunctions on $\\mathbb R^2$, and let $\\cal R$ be a set of $n$ line segments\n(obstacles) in $\\mathbb R^2$. We study the problem of approximating the\nprobability that $p$ and $q$ can see each other; that is, that the segment\nconnecting $p$ and $q$ does not cross any segment of $\\cal R$. To solve this\nproblem, we approximate each density function by a weighted set of polygons; a\nnovel approach to dealing with probability density functions in computational\ngeometry.","authors":["Kevin Buchin","Irina Kostitsyna","Maarten LÃ¶ffler","Rodrigo Silveira"],"meta":["July 2019Algorithmica 81(9)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-019-00551-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234776309_Epsilon_geometry_Building_robust_algorithms_from_imprecise_computations","221559331_Indexing_uncertain_data","291046090_GNSS_accuracy_Lies_damn_lies_and_statistics","282240295_Region-based_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Visibility_between_Imprecise_Locations","226848441_Constructing_strongly_convex_approximate_hulls_with_inaccurate_primitives","225148713_Shape_Fitting_on_Point_Sets_with_Probability_Distributions","222413529_Uncertainty-aware_and_coverage-oriented_deployment_for_sensor_networks","221618660_Support_Vector_Classification_with_Input_Data_Uncertainty","221584391_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221559605_Approximation_algorithms_for_clustering_uncertain_data"]}
