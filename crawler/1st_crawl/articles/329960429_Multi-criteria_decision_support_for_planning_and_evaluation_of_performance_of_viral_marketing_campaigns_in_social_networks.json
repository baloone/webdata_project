{"id":"329960429_Multi-criteria_decision_support_for_planning_and_evaluation_of_performance_of_viral_marketing_campaigns_in_social_networks","abstract":"The current marketing landscape, apart from conventional approaches, consists of campaigns designed especially for launching information diffusion processes within online networks. Associated research is focused on information propagation models, campaign initialization strategies and factors affecting campaign dynamics. In terms of algorithms and performance evaluation, the final coverage represented by the fraction of activated nodes within a target network is usually used. It is not necessarily consistent with the real marketing campaigns using various characteristics and parameters related to coverage, costs, behavioral patterns and time factors for overall evaluation. This paper presents assumptions for a decision support system for multi-criteria campaign planning and evaluation with inputs from agent-based simulations. The results, which are delivered from a simulation model based on synthetic networks in a form of decision scenarios, are verified within a real network. Last, but not least, the study proposes a multi-objective campaign evaluation framework with several campaign evaluation metrics integrated. The results showed that the recommendations generated with the use of synthetic networks applied to real networks delivered results according to the decision makers’ expectation in terms of the used evaluation criteria. Apart from practical applications, the proposed multi-objective approach creates new evaluation possibilities for theoretical studies focused on information spreading processes within complex networks.","authors":["Artur Karczmarczyk","Jarosław Jankowski","Jarosław Wątróbski"],"meta":["December 2018PLoS ONE 13(12):e0209372","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0209372"],"references":["327729908_Probing_Limits_of_Information_Spread_with_Sequential_Seeding","327563950_An_Index_to_Measure_the_Sustainable_Information_Society_The_Polish_Households_Case","326541537_Generalised_framework_for_multi-criteria_method_selection","319696430_Users'_participation_and_social_influence_during_information_spreading_on_Twitter","318475742_Optimizing_influence_diffusion_in_a_social_network_with_fuzzy_costs_for_targeting_nodes","316229651_Dynamic_Rankings_for_Seed_Selection_in_Complex_Networks_Balancing_Costs_and_Coverage","316220619_Balancing_Speed_and_Coverage_by_Sequential_Seeding_in_Complex_Networks","325718464_Non-intrusive_Viral_Marketing_Based_on_Percolation_Centrality","322106711_Profit_Maximization_for_Viral_Marketing_in_Online_Social_Networks_Algorithms_and_Analysis","319700559_Mitigating_Overexposure_in_Viral_Marketing"]}
