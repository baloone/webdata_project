{"id":"281367586_A_Category_Theoretic_Model_of_RDF_Ontology","abstract":"Ontology languages are used in modelling the semantics of concepts within a particular domain and the\nrelationships between those concepts. The Semantic Web standard provides a number of modelling\nlanguages that differ in their level of expressivity and are organized in a Semantic Web Stack in such a way\nthat each language level builds on the expressivity of the other. There are several problems when one\nattempts to use independently developed ontologies. When existing ontologies are adapted for new\npurposes it requires that certain operations are performed on them. These operations are currently\nperformed in a semi-automated manner. This paper seeks to model categorically the syntax and semantics\nof RDF ontology as a step towards the formalization of ontological operations using category theory.","authors":["Aliyu S","Sahalu Junaidu","A.F.
