{"id":"352226158_Improved_Numerical_Computation_to_Solve_Lane-Emden_type_Equations","abstract":"Lane-Emden equation is also of fundamental importance in mathematical physics, celestial mechanics, and computer science. It can be used to describe stellar structures, equilibrium density distribution in polytrophic isothermal gas, thermal behavior in mutual attraction of its molecules. An improved numerical method is developed for solving Lane-Emden type differential equations. The method is based on power series solutions of differential equations and Maclaurin series expansion. A python program is written to carry out numerical calculations. Five examples are solved and shown in this paper, the solutions obtained by the program are compared with the exact solutions of differential equation, an excellent agreement is found between them. The present method improves runtime.","authors":["Amir Qamar","Sheikh Muhammad Zeeshan Iqbal","Fida Hussain Khoso","Zaheer Uddin"],"meta":["June 2021International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering 10(3):1980-1984","DOI:10.30534/ijatcse/2021/681032021"],"references":["334179091_Taylor_series_solution_for_Lane-Emden_equation","328515620_A_fast-converging_iterative_scheme_for_solving_a_system_of_Lane-Emden_equations_arising_in_catalytic_diffusion_reactions","282255747_Numerical_solutions_of_fractional_differential_equations_of_Lane-Emden_type_by_an_accurate_technique","335465481_Laguerre_polynomial_approach_for_solving_Lane-Emden_type_functional_differential_equations","316482881_Solving_the_Non-Isothermal_Reaction-Diffusion_Model_Equations_in_a_Spherical_Catalyst_by_the_Variational_Iteration_Method","285651261_On_the_theoretical_temperature_of_the_sun_under_the_hypothesis_of_a_gaseous_mass_maintaining_its_volume_by_its_internal_heat_and_depending_on_the_laws_of_gases_known_to_terrestrial_experiment","280916559_Solution_of_Lane-Emden_type_equations_using_rational_Bernoulli_functions","262418540_Collocation_method_for_the_numerical_solutions_of_Lane-Emden_type_equations_using_cubic_Hermite_spline_functions","257448525_A_Jacobi-Gauss_collocation_method_for_solving_nonlinear_Lane-Emden_type_equations","256389718_Second_kind_Chebyshev_operational_matrix_algorithm_for_solving_differential_equations_of_Lane-Emden_type","243023907_Lane-Emden_systems_with_negative_exponents","241361536_Lane-Emden_Equation_and_Pad6_Approximants","234368449_New_solutions_of_the_Lane-Emden_equation","234344674_Exact_solutions_of_the_Lane-Emden_equation_in_N-dimensional_space","232957255_Solution_of_Lane-Emden_type_equations_using_Berstein_operational_matrix_of_differentiation"]}
