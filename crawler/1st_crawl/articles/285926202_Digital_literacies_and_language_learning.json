{"id":"285926202_Digital_literacies_and_language_learning","abstract":"The term digital literacies refers to the practices of reading, writing and communication made possible by digital media. The articles in this special issue explore the impact of such digital practices on language learning, examining a) new needs of language learners in the digital age, and b) new globalized, online contexts for language learning. The topics covered include language learners' digital translanguaging in social networking sites, evidence of language learning in out-of-class YouTube comments, language socialization in Wikipedia writing projects, and the digital practices of language teachers both inside and outside of the classroom.","authors":["Christoph A.
