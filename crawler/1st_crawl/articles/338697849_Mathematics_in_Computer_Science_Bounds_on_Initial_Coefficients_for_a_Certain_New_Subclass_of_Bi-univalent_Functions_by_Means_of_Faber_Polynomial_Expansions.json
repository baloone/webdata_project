{"id":"338697849_Mathematics_in_Computer_Science_Bounds_on_Initial_Coefficients_for_a_Certain_New_Subclass_of_Bi-univalent_Functions_by_Means_of_Faber_Polynomial_Expansions","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new subclass T Σ (μ) of bi univalent functions belong to Σ in the open unit disc U = {z : z ∈ C and |z| < 1}. Then, we use the concepts of Faber polynomial expansions to find upper bound for the general coefficient of such functions belongs to the defined class. Further, for the functions in this subclass we obtain bound on first three coefficients |a 2 |, |a 3 | and |a 4 |. We hope that this paper will inspire future researchers in applying our approach to other related problems.","authors":["Fethiye Müge Sakar","· S Melike","Aydo˘ Gan"],"meta":["January 2020Mathematics in Computer Science","Project: Harmonic mappings, univalent functions, bi-univalency."],"references":["315831120_Coefficient_Estimates_for_Certain_Subclasses_of_Meromorphically_Bi-Univalent_Functions","288010246_Coefficient_estimates_for_some_subclasses_of_m_-_Fold_symmetric_bi-univalent_functions","279900936_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_class_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","276235439_Initial_coefficient_bounds_for_a_subclass_of_m_-_Fold_symmetric_bi-univalent_functions","275063838_Initial_Coefficient_Bounds_for_a_General_Class_of_Biunivalent_Functions","263339162_Coefficient_Estimates_for_a_General_Subclass_of_Analytic_and_Bi-Univalent_Functions","262193800_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","258390616_Coefficient_Estimates_for_Certain_Classes_of_Bi-Univalent_Functions","295819634_Initial_coefficient_estimates_for_some_subclasses_of_M-Fold_symmetric_BI-Univalent_functions","265109585_On_a_Coefficient_Problem_for_Bi-Univalent_Functions","247995078_The_Schwarzian_Derivative_and_Univalent_Functions","242995228_Differential_calculus_on_the_Faber_polynomials","257293990_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_certain_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","256936630_A_certain_general_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions_and_associated_coefficient_estimate_problems","242995373_An_algebra_of_differential_operators_and_generating_functions_on_the_set_of_univalent_functions"]}
