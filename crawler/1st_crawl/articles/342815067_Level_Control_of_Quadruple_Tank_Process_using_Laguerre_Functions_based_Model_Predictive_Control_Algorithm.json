{"id":"342815067_Level_Control_of_Quadruple_Tank_Process_using_Laguerre_Functions_based_Model_Predictive_Control_Algorithm","abstract":"This paper aims to present a model predictive controller based on discrete state-space modeling, where the future control trajectory is approximated by a set of discrete-time Laguerre functions instead of shift forward operators. The benefit of using these orthonormal Laguerre functions is that they have fewer parameters to adjust in the optimization problem and the computation load is significantly lower than the standard predictive control. The effectiveness of this controller is illustrated through the quadruple tank process, which is a highly interacted, multivariable and constrained system.","authors":["Menighed Kamel","Issam Chekakta"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.51485/ajss.v5i2.107"],"references":["251888585_Model_Predictive_Control_Design_and_implementation_using_MATLAB_T-3","224065236_Teaching_multivariable_control_using_the_quadruple-tank_process","349081408_Design_of_Effective_Control_Schemes_for_Binary_Distillation_Columns","317775491_Self-Tuning_PID_Control_A_Multivariable_Derivation_and_Application","270681034_Statistical_Theory_of_Communication","231365897_Tuning_PI_Controllers_For_Integrator_Dead_Time_Processes","231294744_Internal_Model_Control_2_Design_Procedure_for_Multivariable_Systems","228641600_Sequential_Design_Method_for_Multivariable_Decoupling_and_Multiloop_PID_Controllers","223630078_Discrete_model_predictive_control_design_using_Laguerre_functions","223315853_Generalized_predictive_control-Part_I_The_basic_algorithm","3352690_Design_and_Experimental_Evaluation_of_a_Multivariable_Self-Tuning_Controller","222033370_Auto-Tuning_of_Multivariable_PID_Controllers_from_Decentralized_Relay_Feedback","48908435_Commandes_cooperatives_embarquees_et_tolerantes_aux_defauts","3352453_Design_of_PID_controllers_based_on_constrained_optimisation","3352436_Predictive_PID_controllers"]}
