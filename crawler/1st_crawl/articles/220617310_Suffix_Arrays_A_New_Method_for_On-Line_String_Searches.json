{"id":"220617310_Suffix_Arrays_A_New_Method_for_On-Line_String_Searches","abstract":"A new and conceptually simple data structure, called a suffixarray, for on-line string searches is intro- duced in this paper. Constructing and querying suffixarrays is reduced to a sort and search paradigm that employs novel algorithms. The main advantage of suffixarrays over suffixtrees is that, in practice, they use three to five times less space. From a complexity standpoint, suffix arrays permit on-line string searches of the type, ''Is W a substring of A?'' to be answered in time O(P + log N), where P is the length of W and N is the length of A, which is competitive with (and in some cases slightly better than) suffixtrees. The only drawback is that in those instances where the underlying alphabet is finiteand small, suffixtrees can be constructed in O(N) time in the worst case, versus O(N log N) time for suffixarrays. However, we give an augmented algorithm that, regardless of the alphabet size, constructs suffixarrays in O(N) expected time, albeit with lesser space efficiency. We believe that suffixarrays will prove to be better in practice than suffixtrees for many applications.","authors":["Udi Manber","Eugene W.
