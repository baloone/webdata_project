{"id":"220421366_An_Algorithm_for_Planning_Collision_Free_Paths_Among_Polyhedral_Obstacles","abstract":"A collision avoidance algorithm for planning a safe path for a polyhedral object moving among known polyhedral objects is described. The algorithm transforms the obstacles so that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitrary reference point on the moving object. A trajectory of this reference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions. Trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates, for each vertex in the transformed obstacles, which other vertices can be reached safely.","authors":["Tomás Lozano-Pérez","Michael A.
