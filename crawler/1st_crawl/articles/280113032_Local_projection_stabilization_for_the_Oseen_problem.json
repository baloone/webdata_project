{"id":"280113032_Local_projection_stabilization_for_the_Oseen_problem","abstract":"We consider conforming finite element approximations of the time-dependent Oseen problem with inf–sup stable approximation\nof velocity and pressure. The work serves as a preliminary study of the incompressible Navier–Stokes problem. In the case\nof high Reynolds numbers, the local projection stabilization method is considered. In particular, the idea of streamline upwinding\nis combined with stabilization of the divergence-free constraint. For the arising semidiscrete problem, a stability and convergence\nanalysis is given. Our approach improves some results of a recent paper by Matthies & Tobiska (2014, IMA J. Numer. Anal., 35, 239–269). Finally, we apply the approach to the time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes problem, test the accuracy of\nthe method and conduct numerical experiments with simple boundary layers and separation.","authors":["Helene Dallmann","Daniel Arndt","Gert Lube"],"meta":["July 2015IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis 36(2)","DOI:10.1093/imanum/drv032"],"references":["259211890_The_dealII_Library_Version_80","252451140_Using_singular_values_to_build_a_subgrid-scale_model_for_large_eddy_simulation","240949470_A_unified_convergence_analysis_for_local_projection_stabilisationsapplied_to_the_Oseen_problem","321517017_Numerical_Methods_for_Singularly_Perturbed_Differential_Equations","279250914_Robust_Arbitrary_Order_Mixed_Finite_Element_Methods_for_the_Incompressible_Stokes_Equations_with_pressure_independent_velocity_errors","273340550_Local_projection_type_stabilization_applied_to_inf-sup_stable_discretizations_of_the_Oseen_problem","270007756_Local_projection_FEM_stabilization_for_the_time-dependent_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_problem_LPS_For_The_Navier-Stokes_Problem","268026316_Numerical_simulation_and_analysis_of_the_steady_and_unsteady_laminar_separation_bubble_on_a_backward-facing_rounded_step_using_the_proper_orthogonal_decomposition","267433895_A_high_order_term-by-term_stabilization_solver_for_incompressible_flow_problems","259095144_On_the_role_of_the_Helmholtz_decomposition_in_mixed_methods_for_incompressible_flows_and_a_new_variational_crime"]}
