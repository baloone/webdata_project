{"id":"338524990_Minimal_Obstructions_for_Partial_Representations_of_Interval_Graphs","abstract":"Interval graphs are intersection graphs of closed intervals. A generalization of recognition called partial representation extension was introduced recently. The input gives an interval graph with a partial representation specifying some pre-drawn intervals. We ask whether the remaining intervals can be added to create an extending representation. Two linear-time algorithms are known for solving this problem. In this paper, we characterize the minimal obstructions which make partial representations non-extendible. This generalizes Lekkerkerker and Boland's characterization of the minimal forbidden induced subgraphs of interval graphs. Each minimal obstruction consists of a forbidden induced subgraph together with at most four pre-drawn intervals. A Helly-type result follows: A partial representation is extendible if and only if every quadruple of pre-drawn intervals is extendible by itself. Our characterization leads to a linear-time certifying algorithm for partial representation extension.","authors":["Pavel Klav√≠k","Maria Saumell"],"meta":["December 2018The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 25(4)","DOI:10.37236/5862"],"references":[]}
