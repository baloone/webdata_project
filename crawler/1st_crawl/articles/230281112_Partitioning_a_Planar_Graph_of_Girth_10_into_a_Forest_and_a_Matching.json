{"id":"230281112_Partitioning_a_Planar_Graph_of_Girth_10_into_a_Forest_and_a_Matching","abstract":"We prove that any finite planar graph with girth at least 10 can have its edges partitioned to form two graphs on the same vertices, one of which is a forest, and the other of which is a matching. Several related results are also demonstrated.","authors":["A. Bassa","J. Burns","J.
