{"id":"346627715_Time_dynamics_of_COVID-19","abstract":"We apply tools from functional data analysis to model cumulative trajectories of COVID-19 cases across countries, establishing a framework for quantifying and comparing cases and deaths across countries longitudinally. It emerges that a country’s trajectory during an initial first month “priming period” largely determines how the situation unfolds subsequently. We also propose a method for forecasting case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model. Decreased workplace mobility is associated with lower doubling rates with a roughly 2 week delay, and case fatality rates exhibit a positive feedback pattern.","authors":["Cody Carroll","Satarupa Bhattacharjee","Yaqing Chen","Paromita Dubey"],"meta":["December 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-77709-4"],"references":["352005207_Challenges_in_control_of_COVID-19_short_doubling_time_and_long_delay_to_effect_of_interventions","342927830_Social_distancing_merely_stabilized_COVID-19_in_the_US","342796073_Mapping_county-level_mobility_pattern_changes_in_the_United_States_in_response_to_COVID-19","341544785_Analysis_of_COVID-19_transmission_in_Shanxi_Province_with_discrete_time_imported_cases","341303880_Social_Distancing_is_Effective_at_Mitigating_COVID-19_Transmission_in_the_United_States","340706994_Failure_in_initial_stage_containment_of_global_COVID-19_epicenters","354176129_Risk_for_Transportation_of_Coronavirus_Disease_from_Wuhan_to_Other_Cities_in_China","341427286_The_positive_impact_of_lockdown_in_Wuhan_on_containing_the_COVID-19_outbreak_in_China","341011892_Spatiotemporal_Analysis_for_the_Outbreak_of_COVID-19_in_the_World","340718926_A_geroscience_perspective_on_COVID-19_mortality"]}
