{"id":"266872328_A_New_Distance-weighted_k_-nearest_Neighbor_Classifier","abstract":"In this paper, we develop a novel Distance-weighted k -nearest Neighbor rule (DWKNN), using the dual distance-weighted function. The proposed DWKNN is motivated by the sensitivity problem of the selection of the neighborhood size k that exists in k -nearest Neighbor rule (KNN), with the aim of improving classification performance. The experiment results on twelve real data sets demonstrate that our proposed classifier is robust to different choices of k to some degree, and yields good performance with a larger optimal k, compared to the other state-of-art KNN-based methods.","authors":["Jianping Gou","Lan Du","Yuhong Zhang","Taisong Xiong"],"meta":["November 2011Journal of Information and Computational Science 9(6)"],"references":["285104963_Top_10_algorithms_in_data_mining","282707871_Nearest_Neighbor_Pattern_Classification","242358078_The_Elements_Of_Statistical_Learning","239056767_Discriminatory_Analysis_Nonparametric_Discrimination_Consistency_Properties","228532864_Neighborhood_size_selection_in_the_k-nearest-neighbor_rule_using_statistical_confidence","225304623_Inroduction_to_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition","224112437_The_Distance-Weighted_k-Nearest-Neighbor_Rule","223657769_Locally_linear_reconstruction_for_instance-based_learning","223371990_A_local_mean-based_nonparametric_classifier","220219379_Pseudo_Nearest_Neighbor_Rule_for_Pattern_Classification"]}
