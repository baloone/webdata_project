{"id":"240918079_On_the_Hardnesses_of_Several_Quantum_Decoding_Problems","abstract":"We classify the time complexities of three important decoding problems for\nquantum stabilizer codes. First, regardless of the channel model, quantum\nbounded distance decoding is shown to be NP-hard, like what Berlekamp, McEliece\nand Tilborg did for classical binary linear codes in 1978. Then over the\ndepolarizing channel, the decoding problems for finding a most likely error and\nfor minimizing the decoding error probability are also shown to be NP-hard. Our\nresults indicate that finding a polynomial-time decoding algorithm for general\nstabilizer codes may be impossible, but this, on the other hand, strengthens\nthe foundation of quantum code-based cryptography.","authors":["Kao-Yueh Kuo","Chung-Chin Lu"],"meta":["February 2020Quantum Information Processing 19(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-020-02622-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["289892396_Approximations_and_complex_multiplication_according_to_Ramanujan","268670421_Codes_and_algebraic_curves","262234760_Quantum_McEliece_public-key_cryptosystem","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","227152963_Wild_McEliece","224349527_Concatenated_Quantum_Codes_Constructible_in_Polynomial_Time_Efficient_Decoding_and_Error_Correction","220961220_A_further_study_on_the_encoding_complexity_of_quantum_stabilizer_codes","220695837_Algebraic_Function_Fields_and_Codes","220681472_Quantum_Information_Theory","220555391_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Computation","49457599_Faster_Integer_Multiplication","46583628_NP-hardness_of_decoding_quantum_error-correction_codes","30764214_On_the_inherent_intractability_of_certain_coding_problems","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes","23608386_A_Public-Key_Cryptosystem_Based_on_Algebraic_Coding_Theory"]}
