{"id":"285275138_Classification_with_confidence","abstract":"A framework for classification is developed with a notion of confidence. In this framework, a classifier consists of two tolerance\nregions in the predictor space, with a specified coverage level for each class. The classifier also produces an ambiguous\nregion where the classification needs further investigation. Theoretical analysis reveals interesting structures of the confidence-ambiguity\ntrade-off, and the optimal solution is characterized by extending the Neymanâ€“Pearson lemma. We provide general estimating\nprocedures, along with rates of convergence, based on estimates of the conditional probabilities. The method can be easily\nimplemented with good robustness, as illustrated through theory, simulation and a data example.","authors":["Jing Lei"],"meta":["December 2014Biometrika 101(4):755-769","DOI:10.1093/biomet/asu038"],"references":["254281536_DD-Classifier_Nonparametric_Classification_Procedure_Based_on_DD-Plot","38360933_The_Tight_Constant_in_the_Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz_Inequality","2133079_Optimal_rates_for_plug-in_estimators_of_density_level_sets","2123930_On-line_predictive_linear_regression","263596285_Estimation_of_density_level_sets_with_a_given_probability_content","263557023_Distribution-free_prediction_bands_for_non-parametric_regression","263063666_Distribution-Free_Prediction_Sets","259629201_Set-Valued_Dynamic_Treatment_Regimes_for_Competing_Outcomes","251134121_Nonparametric_estimators","235712549_A_Conformal_Prediction_Approach_to_Explore_Functional_Data","230996365_Conditional_validity_of_inductive_conformal_predictors","227705183_Classification_with_reject_option","225689761_Analysis_to_Neyman-Pearson_classification_with_convex_loss_function","224817352_On_Nonparametric_Estimation_of_Density_Level_Sets","220683116_A_Neyman-Pearson_Approach_to_Statistical_Learning","46537457_Large-scale_multiple_testing_under_dependence","38358892_Optimal_Global_Rates_of_Convergence_for_Nonparametric_Regression","38357488_Measuring_Mass_Concentrations_and_Estimating_Density_Contour_Clusters-An_Excess_Mass_Approach","38322400_Some_theory_for_Fisher's_linear_discriminant_function_naive_Bayes'_and_some_alternatives_when_there_are_many_more_variables_than_observations","5230272_Classification_with_reject_option_in_gene_expression_data","4742774_Oracle_and_Adaptive_Compound_Decision_Rules_for_False_Discovery_Rate_Control","3081601_On_Optimum_Recognition_Error_and_Reject_Tradeoff","2120957_Fast_learning_rates_for_plug-in_classifiers","1917945_High-dimensional_generalized_linear_models_and_the_LASSO"]}
