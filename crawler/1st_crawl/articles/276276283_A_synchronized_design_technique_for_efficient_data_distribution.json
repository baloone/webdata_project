{"id":"276276283_A_synchronized_design_technique_for_efficient_data_distribution","abstract":"One of the important features of database fragmentation and allocation techniques is the fact that they\ndepend not only on the entries of a database relation, but also on their empirical frequencies of use. Distributed\nprocessing is an effective way to improve performance of database systems. However, for a Distributed\nDatabase System (DDBS) to function efficiently, fragments of the database need to be allocated\ncarefully at various sites across the relevant communications network. Therefore, fragmentation and\nproper allocation of fragments across network sites is considered as a key research area in distributed\ndatabase environment. However, fragments allocation to the most appropriate sites is not an easy task\nto perform. This paper proposes a synchronized horizontal fragmentation, replication and allocation\nmodel that adopts a new approach to horizontally fragment a database relation based on attribute retrieval\nand update frequency to find an optimal solution for the allocation problem. A heuristic technique to\nsatisfy horizontal fragmentation and allocation using a cost model to minimize the total cost of distribution\nis developed. Experimental results are consistent with the hypothesis and confirm that the proposed\nmodel can efficiently solve dynamic fragmentation and allocation problem in a distributed relational\ndatabase environment.","authors":["Hassan I.
