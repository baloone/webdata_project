{"id":"264994797_Complement_of_a_fuzzy_graph","abstract":"The definition of complement of a fuzzy graph is modified and some properties of self complementary fuzzy graphs are studied. We show that automorphism groups of a fuzzy graph and its complement are identifical and a relative study of complement and some other operations on fuzzy graphs such as union, join and composition has been made.","authors":["M.
