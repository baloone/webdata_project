{"id":"266371914_Total_phenolics_and_antioxidant_activity_of_Tridax_procumbens_Linn","abstract":"Traditional medicinal plant, Tridax procumbens was analyzed for reducing power ability as an antioxidant using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and for total phenolics using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The results of the analysis show that T. procumbens has a percentage antioxidant activity (AA %) of 96.70 which was observed to be higher than those of gallic (92.92%) and ascorbic acids (94.81%) used as standards. The reductive potential determination shows that T. procumbens has a very significant reductive potential of 0.89 nm at the same concentration with gallic acid whose reductive potential was 0.99 nm. The total phenolic determination shows that T. procumbens has a phenolic content of 12 mg/g GAE. The results of this analysis revealed the fact that plants are rich sources of natural antioxidant.","authors":["J.D Habila","Isaac Bello","A A Dzikwi","H Musa"],"meta":["November 2009African Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology 4(3)"],"references":["272330412_Effect_of_aqueous_leaf_extract_of_Tridax_procumbens_on_blood_pressure_and_heart_rate_in_rats","268327172_Comparative_Study_of_the_Mineral_Element_Composition_of_Some_Common_Nigerian_Medicinal_Plants","237511160_Comparative_Study_of_the_Vitamin_Composition_of_Some_Common_Nigerian_Medicinal_Plants","228352140_Phytochemical_constituent_and_antioxidant_activity_of_extract_from_the_leaves_of_Ocimum_gratissimum","248744360_Phenolics_and_Betacyanins_in_Red_Beetroot_Beta_v_ulgaris_Root_Distribution_and_Effect_of_Cold_Storage_on_the_Content_of_Total_Phenolics_and_Three_Individual_Compounds","222629817_Antioxidant_activity_of_grape_seed_Vitis_vinifera_extracts_on_peroxidation_models_in_vitro","15564716_The_Relative_Antioxidant_Activities_of_Plant-Derived_Polyphenolic_Flavonoids","12747683_Antioxidant_Activity_of_Plant_Extracts_Containing_Phenolic_Compounds","12065185_Screening_of_Brazilian_plant_extracts_for_antioxidant_activity_by_the_use_of_DPPH_free_radical_method","10778252_Free_radical-scavenging_activity_of_Taiwanese_native_plants","7948544_Effect_of_Tridax_procumbens_on_liver_antioxidant_defense_system_during_lipopolysaccharide-induced_hepatitis_in_D-galactosamine_sensitized_rats"]}
