{"id":"307870677_Monte_Carlo_-_Metropolis_Investigations_of_Shape_and_Matrix_Effects_in_2D_and_3D_Spin-Crossover_Nanoparticles","abstract":"The Ising like model, taking into account short-, long-range interaction as well as surface effects is used to investigate size and shape effects on the thermal behaviour of 2D and 3D spin crossover (SCO) nanoparticles embedded in a matrix. We analyze the role of the parametert, representing the ratio between the number of surface and volume molecules, on the unusual thermal hysteresis behaviour (appearance of the hysteresis and a re-entrance phase transition) at small scales.","authors":["Salim Guerroudj","Rafael Caballero","Francisco De Zela","Jureschi Cătălin Maricel"],"meta":["August 2016Journal of Physics Conference Series 738(1):012068","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/738/1/012068"],"references":["243457324_Ising-like_model_for_the_two-step_spin-crossover","243457302_Analytical_solution_of_1D_Ising-like_systems_modified_by_weak_long_range_interaction_Application_to_spin_crossover_compounds","243426932_Two-dimensional_Ising-like_model_with_specific_edge_effects_for_spin-crossover_nanoparticles_A_Monte_Carlo_study","225678442_Single_crystal_diffraction_analysis_of_the_thermal_spin_conversion_in_Febtr2NCS2H2O_Evidence_for_spin-like_domain_formation","225528817_Analytical_solution_of_1D_Ising-like_systems_modified_by_weak_long_range_interaction","50818431_Dynamical_Ising-like_model_for_the_two-step_spin-crossover_systems","282520314_Matrix_and_size_effects_on_the_appearance_of_the_thermal_hysteresis_in_2D_spin_crossover_nanoparticles","265053927_Re-Appearance_of_Cooperativity_in_Ultra-Small_Spin-Crossover_FepzNiCN4_Nanoparticles","254861026_Size_effect_in_spin-crossover_systems_investigated_by_FORC_measurements_for_surfacted_FeNH_2-trz_3Br_23H_2O_nanoparticles_Reversible_contributions_and_critical_size","44631750_Tuning_Size_and_Thermal_Hysteresis_in_Bistable_Spin_Crossover_Nanoparticles"]}
