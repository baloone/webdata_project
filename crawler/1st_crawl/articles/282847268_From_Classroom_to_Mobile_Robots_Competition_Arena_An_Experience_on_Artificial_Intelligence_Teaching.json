{"id":"282847268_From_Classroom_to_Mobile_Robots_Competition_Arena_An_Experience_on_Artificial_Intelligence_Teaching","abstract":"This paper presents an educational experience developed in the fourth year of Computer Engineering degree at Huelva University (Spain). To make Artificial Intelligent (AI) learning processes more captivating, a new educational project was incorporated into classical teaching of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering subject. In this paper, we present the experience fulfilled with a group of college students. Here it is related how they changed for some days their classroom lessons for the robotic competition arena. With this project we have extended regular classroom lessons with additional work that could be useful and cannot be provided by traditional practical lessons, the real life experience. As a real example about how the work was accomplished we describe the mechanical construction of the mobile robots as well as the software development process.","authors":["Tom√°s de J.
