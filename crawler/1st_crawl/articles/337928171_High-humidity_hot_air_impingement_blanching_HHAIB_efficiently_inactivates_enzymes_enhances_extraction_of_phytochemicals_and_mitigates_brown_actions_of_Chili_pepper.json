Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the blanching conditions based on product POD residual activity and browning index. Results indicated that blanching temperature of 110 °C, relative humidity of 40% and blanching time of 38 s were the optimum blanching conditions, which resulted in the minimum POD residual activity (0.52%) and browning index difference (7.09). Validation test showed that the predicted data had good agreement with the experimental data. Results also indicated that compared with the non-blanched samples, the extraction content of ascorbic acid and red pigment from blanched pepper under optimal blanching conditions increased by 42.85% and 8.20%, respectively. Ultrastructural observations explained why moderate blanching can promote the extraction of phytochemicals. The findings in current work indicate that HHAIB can efficiently inactivate enzymes, enhance extraction of phytochemicals and at the meantime mitigate brown actions under optimal conditions.","authors":["HuiWang","Qian Zhang","Arun Mujumdar","Xiao-Ming Fang"],"meta":["December 2019Food Control
