{"id":"309641807_A_Survey_on_Survey_of_Migration_of_Legacy_Systems","abstract":"Legacy systems are mission critical complex systems which are hard to maintain owing to shortage of skill sets and monolithic code architecture with tightly coupled tiers, all of which are indication of obsoleteness of the system technology. Thus, they have to be migrated to the latest technology(ies). Migration is an offspring research in Software Engineering which is almost three decades old research and numerous publications have emerged in many topics in the migration domain with focus areas of code migration, architecture migration, case study on migration and effort estimation on migration. In addition, various survey works surveying different aspects of migration have also emerged. This paper provides a survey of these survey works in order to provide a consolidation of these survey works. As an outcome of the survey on survey of migration, a road map of migration evolution from the early stages to the recent works on migration comprising of significant milestones in migration research has been presented in this work.","authors":["A.
