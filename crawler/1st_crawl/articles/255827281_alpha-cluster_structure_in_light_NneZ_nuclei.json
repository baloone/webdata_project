{"id":"255827281_alpha-cluster_structure_in_light_NneZ_nuclei","abstract":"The clustering phenomena in light N{ne}Z nuclei are discussed. Measurements of resonance elastic scattering of {sup 14}C on {sup 4}He, and the excitation functions for the {sup 9}Be(p,{alpha}){sup 6}Li(T = 1) reaction has been performed. All measurements were made in inverse kinematics. The excitation functions were analyzed in the framework of the R-matrix approach. Many new states with large {alpha} reduced widths were identified in {sup 18}O. Strong cluster T = 1 states in {sup 10}B have been identified in {sup 9}Be. The results show that extra (in comparison with the self-conjugate nuclei) nucleons make evident changes in the properties of the {alpha}-cluster bands.","authors":["V. Z.
