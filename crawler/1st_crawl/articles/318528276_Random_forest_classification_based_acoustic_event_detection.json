{"id":"318528276_Random_forest_classification_based_acoustic_event_detection","abstract":"This paper deals with the acoustic event detection (AED) to improve the detection accuracy of acoustic events. Acoustic event detection task is performed by a regression via classification (RvC) based approach along with the random forest technique. A discretization process is used to convert the continuous frame positions within acoustic events into event duration class labels. Outputs of the category-specific random forest classifiers are then reversed back to the event boundary information. Evaluations on the UPC-TALP database which consists of highly variable acoustic events demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches with improvements in detection error rate compared to the best baseline system.","authors":["Xianjun Xia","Roberto Togneri","Ferdous Sohel","Defeng David Huang"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICME.2017.8019452","Conference: IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) 2017","Project: acoustic event detection"],"references":["281947316_A_Database_and_Challenge_for_Acoustic_Scene_Classification_and_Event_Detection","267324812_Random_Regression_Forests_for_Acoustic_Event_Detection_and_Classification","261502450_Automatic_acoustic_siren_detection_in_traffic_noise_by_part-based_models","261466213_Log-frequency_spectrogram_for_respiratory_sound_monitoring","258168712_Hierarchical_modeling_using_automated_sub-clustering_for_sound_event_recognition","221545753_The_CLEAR_2007_evaluation","271449987_Fear-type_emotion_recognition_and_abnormal_events_detection_for_an_audio-based_surveillance_system","261315206_An_exemplar-based_NMF_approach_to_audio_event_detection","221545778_CLEAR_Evaluation_of_Acoustic_Event_Detection_and_Classification_Systems","221512431_Random_Forest_Classification_for_Automatic_Delineation_of_Myocardium_in_Real-Time_3D_Echocardiography"]}
