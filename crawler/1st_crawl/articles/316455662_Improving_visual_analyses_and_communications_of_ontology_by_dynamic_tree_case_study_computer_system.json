{"id":"316455662_Improving_visual_analyses_and_communications_of_ontology_by_dynamic_tree_case_study_computer_system","abstract":"Visual Analysis is one participatory tool for mapping out main domains like ontology; along with their causes and effects, it supports domain planners to identify clear and manageable communications between the components of the domain and the strategy aimed at achieving them. Presenting computer system is a good area of employing visualization effectively; a computer system domain consists of hardware components that are integrated with each other to build full computer. The purpose of this paper is to create a visual analysis dynamic tree for the hardware components of a computer system by creating a number of concepts that represent the knowledge of this domain in a dynamic way in order to reduce the size of the layout since issue is critical in data visualization. The paper also aims at supporting the sharing and the reusing of the represented knowledge on other related problems.","authors":["Ameen Shaheen","Rizik M.
