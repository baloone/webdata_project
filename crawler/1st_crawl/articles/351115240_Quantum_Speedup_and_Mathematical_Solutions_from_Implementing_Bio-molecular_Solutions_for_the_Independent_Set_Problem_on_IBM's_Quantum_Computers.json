Next, we show that a new kind of the straightforward Boolean circuit yielded from the bio-molecular solutions with m NAND gates, (m + n × (n +1)) AND gates and ((n × (n + 1)) / 2) NOT gates can find the maximal independent-set(s) to the independent-set problem for any graph G with m edges and n vertices. We show that a new kind of the proposed quantum-molecular algorithm can find the maximal independent set(s) with the lower bound O(2n/2) queries and the upper bound Ω(2n/2) queries. This work offers an obvious evidence that to solve the independent-set problem in any graph G with m edges and n vertices, bio-molecular computers are able to generate a new kind of the straightforward Boolean circuit such that by means of implementing it quantum computers can give a quadratic speed-up. This work also offers one obvious evidence that quantum computers can significantly accelerate the speed and enhance the scalability of bio-molecular computers. Furthermore, to justify the feasibility of the proposed quantum-molecular algorithm, we successfully solve a typical independent set problem for a graph G with three vertices and two edges by carrying out experiments on the backend ibmqx4 with five quantum bits and the backend simulator with 32 quantum bits on IBM's quantum computer.","authors":["Weng-Long Chang","Ju-Chin Chen","Wen-Yu Chung","Chun-Yuan Hsiao"],"meta":["April 2021IEEE transactions on nanobioscience 20(3):354-376","DOI:10.1109/TNB.2021.3075733","Project: My publications using IBM Quantum systems / Qiskit"],"references":["347321641_Parallel_DNA_Algorithms_of_Generalized_Traveling_Salesman_Problem-Based_Bioinspired_Computing_Model","336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","331911375_Diverse_and_robust_molecular_algorithms_using_reprogrammable_DNA_self-assembly","324097602_Quantum_speedup_in_solving_the_maximal-clique_problem","323388632_A_DNA_Computing_Model_for_the_Graph_Vertex_Coloring_Problem_Based_on_a_Probe_Graph","334757141_A_novel_bio-heuristic_computing_algorithm_to_solve_the_capacitated_vehicle_routing_problem_based_on_Adleman-Lipton_model","332953438_Solving_large_minimum_vertex_cover_problems_on_a_quantum_annealer","329598188_Practical_Quantum_Computing_for_Developers_Programming_Quantum_Rigs_in_the_Cloud_using_Python_Quantum_Assembly_Language_and_IBM_QExperience","321596330_Theoretical_and_Experimental_DNA_Computation","317404417_Exact_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set","283323295_The_DNA-Based_Algorithms_of_Implementing_Arithmetical_Operations_of_Complex_Vectors_on_a_Biological_Computer","316520114_Breaking_DES_using_a_molecular_computer","311737132_Quantum_speedup_of_the_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_for_bounded-degree_graphs","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers"]}
