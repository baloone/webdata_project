The role of SCM in training of bachelors of computer science and especially their use in operations research learning is revealed. The main characteristics of SCM MAXIMA and ways of access to it both locally and in the cloud-oriented implementation are considered. The results of the expert evaluation of the cloud-based learning component with the use of MAXIMA system for operations research learning are presented.","authors":["Mariya Shyshkina","Ulyana P.
