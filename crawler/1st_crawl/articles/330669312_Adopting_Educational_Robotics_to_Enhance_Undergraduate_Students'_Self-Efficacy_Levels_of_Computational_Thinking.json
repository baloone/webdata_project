{"id":"330669312_Adopting_Educational_Robotics_to_Enhance_Undergraduate_Students'_Self-Efficacy_Levels_of_Computational_Thinking","abstract":"Computational Thinking (CT) skill, as an essential 21 st-century skill, is an important problem-solving and survival abilities in the era of disruption. Universal principles generating a pattern of abstraction develop step-by-step troubleshooting instructions in solving similar problems, perceiving similarities/differences between the patterns, and making a complex problem solvable. The skill could be applied to various engineering fields by emphasising efficiency, accuracy, and capability of problem-solving. Recently, robot enthusiasts in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) learning that involves 'assembling, programming and testing' activities, underscore CT skills. This research explores the CT pattern along with participants-developed robotics activities.","authors":["Feri Ardiana Aristawati","Cucuk Budiyanto","Rosihan Ari Yuana"],"meta":["December 2018Journal of Turkish Science Education 15(Special Issue):42-50","DOI:10.12973/tused.10255a)","Project: Teaching Innovation"],"references":["325846498_Understanding_Students_Behavior_During_the_Adoption_of_Modular_Robotics_in_Learning","312870182_A_review_Can_robots_reshape_K-12_STEM_education","312039564_Developing_Computational_Thinking_in_Compulsory_Education_Implications_for_policy_and_practice","274378317_A_Serious_Game_for_Developing_Computational_Thinking_and_Learning_Introductory_Computer_Programming","265208083_How_to_Support_Students'_Computational_Thinking_Skills_in_Educational_Robotics_Activities","264043999_Educational_Robots_and_Computational_Thinking","325081043_STEM_Outreach_Assessing_Computational_Thinking_and_Problem_Solving","324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","283453083_Advancing_students'_computational_thinking_skills_through_educational_robotics_A_study_on_age_and_gender_relevant_differences","272566756_Qualitative_Data_Analysis_A_Methods_Sourcebook"]}
