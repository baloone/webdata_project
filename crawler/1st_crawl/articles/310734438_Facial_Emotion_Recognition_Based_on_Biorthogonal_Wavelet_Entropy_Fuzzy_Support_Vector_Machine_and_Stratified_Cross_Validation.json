{"id":"310734438_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_Based_on_Biorthogonal_Wavelet_Entropy_Fuzzy_Support_Vector_Machine_and_Stratified_Cross_Validation","abstract":"Emotion recognition represents the position and motion of facial muscles. It contributes significantly in many fields. Current approaches have not obtained good results. This study aimed to propose a new emotion recognition system based on facial expression images. We enrolled 20 subjects and let each subject pose seven different emotions: happy, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and neutral. Afterwards, we employed biorthogonal wavelet entropy to extract multiscale features, and used fuzzy multiclass support vector machine to be the classifier. The stratified cross validation was employed as a strict validation model. The statistical analysis showed our method achieved an overall accuracy of 96.77Â±0.10%. Besides, our method is superior to three state-of-the-art methods. In all, this proposed method is efficient.","authors":["Yu-Dong Zhang","Zhang-Jing yang","Huimin Lu","Xing-Xing Zhou"],"meta":["November 2016IEEE Access 4:8375-8385","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2628407"],"references":["339295916_Performance_Analysis_of_Acoustic_Emotion_Recognition_for_In-Car_Conversational_Interfaces","312645800_Emotion_Recognition_from_Facial_Expressions_for_4D_Videos_Using_Geometric_Approach","307872883_Comparison_of_machine_learning_methods_for_stationary_wavelet_entropy-based_multiple_sclerosis_detection_Decision_tree_k_-nearest_neighbors_and_support_vector_machine","307769408_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Its_Applications_2014","307683503_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Its_Applications","305478088_Does_Facial_Amimia_Impact_the_Recognition_of_Facial_Emotions_An_EMG_Study_in_Parkinson's_Disease","305416960_GroRec_A_Group-Centric_Intelligent_Recommender_System_Integrating_Social_Mobile_and_Big_Data_Technologies","309082022_Structure-Adaptive_Fuzzy_Estimation_for_Random-Valued_Impulse_Noise_Suppression","308730085_A_Hybrid_Bioinspired_Algorithm_for_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_Using_CSO-GA-PSO-SVM","305471707_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_in_Adolescents_With_Disabilities_The_Effects_of_Type_of_Disability_and_Gender"]}
