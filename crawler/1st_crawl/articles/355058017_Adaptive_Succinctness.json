{"id":"355058017_Adaptive_Succinctness","abstract":"Representing a static set of integers S, \\(|S| = n\\) from a finite universe \\(U = [1{..}u]\\) is a fundamental task in computer science. Our concern is to represent S in small space while supporting the operations of \\(\\mathsf {rank}\\) and \\(\\mathsf {select}\\) on S; if S is viewed as its characteristic vector, the problem becomes that of representing a bit-vector, which is arguably the most fundamental building block of succinct data structures. Although there is an information-theoretic lower bound of \\({\\mathcal {B}}(n, u)= \\lg {u\\atopwithdelims ()n}\\) bits on the space needed to represent S, this applies to worst-case (random) sets S, and sets found in practical applications are compressible. We focus on the case where elements of S contain runs of| \\(\\ell >1\\) consecutive elements, one that occurs in many practical situations. Let \\({\\mathcal {C}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle (}n{\\scriptscriptstyle )}}\\) denote the class of \\({u\\atopwithdelims ()n}\\) distinct sets of \\(n\\) elements over the universe \\([1{..}u]\\). Let also \\({\\mathcal {C}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle (}n{\\scriptscriptstyle )}}_{g}\\subset {\\mathcal {C}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle (}n{\\scriptscriptstyle )}}\\) contain the sets whose \\(n\\) elements are arranged in \\(g \\le n\\) runs of \\(\\ell _i \\ge 1\\) consecutive elements from U for \\(i=1,\\ldots , g\\), and let \\({\\mathcal {C}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle (}n{\\scriptscriptstyle )}}_{g,r}\\subset {\\mathcal {C}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle (}n{\\scriptscriptstyle )}}_{g}\\) contain all sets that consist of g runs, such that \\(r \\le g\\) of them have at least 2 elements. This paper yields the following insights and contributions related to \\(\\mathsf {rank}\\)/\\(\\mathsf {select}\\) succinct data structures:\nWe introduce new compressibility measures for sets, including:\n\\({\\mathcal {B}}_1(g,n,u)= \\lg {|{\\mathcal {C}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle (}n{\\scriptscriptstyle )}}_{g}|} = \\lg {{u-n+1 \\atopwithdelims ()g}} + \\lg {{n-1 \\atopwithdelims ()g-1}}\\), and\n\\({\\mathcal {B}}_2(r, g, n,u)= \\lg {|{\\mathcal {C}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle (}n{\\scriptscriptstyle )}}_{g,r}|} =\\lg {{u-n+1 \\atopwithdelims ()g}} + \\lg {{n-g-1 \\atopwithdelims ()r-1}} + \\lg {{g\\atopwithdelims ()r}}\\),\nsuch that \\({\\mathcal {B}}_2(r, g, n,u)\\le {\\mathcal {B}}_1(g,n,u)\\le {\\mathcal {B}}(n, u)\\).\nWe give data structures that use space close to bounds \\({\\mathcal {B}}_1(g,n,u)\\) and \\({\\mathcal {B}}_2(r, g, n,u)\\) and support \\(\\mathsf {rank}\\) and \\(\\mathsf {select}\\) in \\(\\mathrm {O}(1)\\) time.\nWe provide additional measures involving entropy-coding run lengths and gaps between items, and data structures to support \\(\\mathsf {rank}\\) and \\(\\mathsf {select}\\) using space close to these measures.","authors":["Diego Arroyuelo","Rajeev Raman"],"meta":["October 2021Algorithmica","DOI:10.1007/s00453-021-00872-1"],"references":["325408300_Hybrid_compression_of_inverted_lists_for_reordered_document_collections","315371728_Disjoint_interval_partitioning","281066080_A_data-aware_FM-index","347391882_Techniques_for_Inverted_Index_Compression","345901236_A_Walk_Through_Combinatorics_An_Introduction_to_Enumeration_and_Graph_Theory","338628640_Fully_Functional_Suffix_Trees_and_Optimal_Text_Searching_in_BWT-Runs_Bounded_Space","336272205_Adaptive_Succinctness","305765533_An_efficient_method_to_evaluate_intersections_on_big_data_sets1","267678051_From_Time_to_Space_Fast_Algorithms_That_Yield_Small_and_Fast_Data_Structures","267128045_A_walk_through_combinatorics_An_introduction_to_enumeration_and_graph_theory_3rd_ed","232918560_Binary_Interval_Search_BITS_A_Scalable_Algorithm_for_Counting_Interval_Intersections","266658724_Partitioned_Elias-Fano_Indexes","266656596_Overlap_interval_partition_join","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","242378247_Novel_Compression_of_Sparse_Bit-Strings_-_Preliminary_Report"]}
