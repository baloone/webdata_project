{"id":"307619155_Mining_Educational_Data_for_Academic_Accreditation_Aligning_Assessment_with_Outcomes","abstract":"Institutions in higher education generate terabytes of data that has great value to shape future of nations. This Big Data is in heterogeneous formats, very current, and in large volumes. We propose a framework to collect, scope and verify this large amount of data. The analysis of the data is used to evaluate the institution against a standard set by an accreditation body, for the purpose of the academic accreditation of higher education programs. Therefore, the framework reduces human involvement in accreditation. The paper provides the detailed design of the process of aligning assessment with student learning outcomes.","authors":["Mohammed Hussain","Basel Almourad","Sujith Samuel Mathew","Abdullah Hussein"],"meta":["September 2016Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management 18(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40171-016-0143-3","Project: A Big Data Approach for Analyzing Student Interaction with Educational Systems"],"references":["282301373_Exascale_Computing_and_Big_Data","276248376_Beyond_the_hype_Big_data_concepts_methods_and_analytics","263890120_Technology_Enhanced_Analytics_TEA_in_Higher_Education","285418710_The_Implementation_of_Innovative_Services_in_Education_by_Using_Cloud_Infrastructure_and_Their_Economic_Aspects","280113623_The_Text_Mining_Handbook_Advanced_Approaches_in_Analyzing_Unstructured_Data","263480370_Big_data_A_survey","259682881_Preparing_for_Program_Accreditation_Review_Under_ABET_Engineering_Criteria_2000_Choosing_Outcome_Indicators","254012870_Survey_on_NoSQL_database","228346723_The_Hadoop_Distributed_File_System","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections"]}
