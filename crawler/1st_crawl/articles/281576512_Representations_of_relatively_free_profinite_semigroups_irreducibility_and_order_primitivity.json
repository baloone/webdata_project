{"id":"281576512_Representations_of_relatively_free_profinite_semigroups_irreducibility_and_order_primitivity","abstract":"We establish that, under certain closure assumptions on a pseudovariety of\nsemigroups, the corresponding relatively free profinite semigroups freely\ngenerated by a non-singleton finite set act faithfully on their minimum ideals.\nAs applications, we enlarge the scope of several previous join irreducibility\nresults for pseudovarieties of semigroups, which turn out to be even join\nirreducible in the lattice of pseudovarieties of ordered semigroups, so that,\nin particular, they are not generated by proper subpseudovarieties of ordered\nsemigroups. We also prove the stronger form of join irreducibility for the\nKrohn-Rhodes complexity pseudovarieties, thereby solving a problem proposed by\nRhodes and Steinberg.","authors":["Jorge Almeida","Ondrej Klima"],"meta":["September 2015Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 373(3)","DOI:10.1090/tran/7951","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265218456_The_Translational_Hull_of_a_Topological_Semigroup","244194145_Ash's_type_II_theorem_pronite_topology_and_Malcev_products_Part_I","220980094_Join_Irreducible_Pseudovarieties_Group_Mapping_and_Kovcs-Newman_Semigroups","220169631_Subword_Complexity_of_Profinite_Words_and_Subgroups_of_Free_Profinite_Semigroups","2420365_Irreducibility_of_Certain_Pseudovarieties","266014209_The_theory_of_topological_semigroups_Volume_2","264946710_Varieties_and_Pseudovarieties_of_Ordered_Normal_Bands","256269896_Almost_finite_expansions_of_arbitrary_semigroups","256206328_Partially_ordered_finite_monoids_and_a_theorem_of_I_Simon","256204993_Equidivisible_semigroups","248068470_Theorems_on_Compact_Totally_Disconnected_Semigroups_and_Lattices","247516552_Sigma_Series_in_Pure_Mathematics","246674457_Lectures_on_the_algebraic_theory_of_finite_semi-groups_and_finite-state_machines","245434451_Aperiodic_homomorphisms_and_the_concatenation_product_of_recognizable_sets","244922065_Actions_Wreath_Products_of_C-varieties_and_Concatenation_Product","243018203_Infinite_iteration_of_matrix_semigroups_II_Structure_theorem_for_arbitrary_semigroups_up_to_aperiodic_morphism","242983012_The_Rhodes_expansion_and_free_objects_in_varieties_of_completely_regular_semigroups","242982445_Iteration_of_expansions_-_unambiguous_semigroups","239284656_Chapter_4_Synthesis_of_the_classical_and_modern_theory_of_finite_semigroups","231869660_Complete_endomorphisms_of_the_lattice_of_pseudovarieties_of_finite_semigroups","231786922_Hyperdecidability_of_pseudovarieties_of_orthogroups","226897983_The_Birkhoff_theorem_for_finite_algebras","226802281_A_Reiterman_theorem_for_pseudovarieties_of_finite_first-order_structures","226725378_On_the_word_problem_for_free_completely_regular_semigroups","226349461_Nonstandard_characterization_of_pseudovarieties","221220325_Piecewise_testable_events","51956710_Star-Free_Languages_are_Church-Rosser_Congruential","38383182_Undecidability_of_the_Identity_Problem_for_Finite_Semigroups","2386547_On_The_Extension_Problem_For_Partial_Permutations"]}
