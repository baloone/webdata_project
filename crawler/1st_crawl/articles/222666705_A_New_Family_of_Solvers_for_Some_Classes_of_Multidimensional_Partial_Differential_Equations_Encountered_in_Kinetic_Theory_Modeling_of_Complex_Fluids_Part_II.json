However, these techniques involve a high number of approximation functions. In the finite element framework, widely used in complex flow simulations, each approximation function is related to a node that defines the associated degree of freedom. When the model involves high dimensional spaces (including physical and conformation spaces and time), standard discretization techniques fail due to an excessive computation time required to perform accurate numerical simulations. One appealing strategy that allows circumventing this limitation is based on the use of reduced approximation basis within an adaptive procedure making use of an efficient separation of variables.","authors":["Amine Ammar","Béchir Mokdad","Francisco Chinesta","R.
