{"id":"308083512_Raspberry_Pi_An_Effective_Vehicle_in_Teaching_the_Internet_of_Things_in_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","abstract":"The Raspberry Pi is being increasingly adopted as a suitable platform in both research and applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). This study presents a novel project-based teaching and learning approach devised in an Internet of Things course for undergraduate students in the computer science major, where the Raspberry Pi platform is used as an effective vehicle to greatly enhance studentsâ€™ learning performance and experience. The devised course begins with learning simple hardware and moves to building a whole prototype system. This paper illustrates the outcome of the proposed approach by demonstrating the prototype IoT systems designed and developed by students at the end of one such IoT course. Furthermore, this study provides insights and lessons regarding how to facilitate the use of the Raspberry Pi platform to successfully achieve the goals of project-based teaching and learning in IoT.","authors":["Xiaoyang Zhong","Yao Liang"],"meta":["September 2016Electronics 5(3):56","DOI:10.3390/electronics5030056","Project: Course"],"references":["278450797_The_Effects_of_Project_Based_Learning_on_Undergraduate_Students'_Achievement_and_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_Towards_Science_Teaching","276428967_Teaching_Power_Electronics_With_a_Design-Oriented_Project-Based_Learning_Method_at_the_Technical_University_of_Denmark","271658486_HOW_SCIENCE_TECHNOLOGY_ENGINEERING_AND_MATHEMATICS_STEM_PROJECT-BASED_LEARNING_PBL_AFFECTS_HIGH_MIDDLE_AND_LOW_ACHIEVERS_DIFFERENTLY_THE_IMPACT_OF_STUDENT_FACTORS_ON_ACHIEVEMENT","269112096_Towards_Long-Term_Multi-Hop_WSN_Deployments_for_Environmental_Monitoring_An_Experimental_Network_Evaluation","308815961_More_missing_the_Boat_-_Arduino_Raspberry_Pi_and_small_prototyping_boards_and_engineering_education_needs_them","302484330_The_Empathy_Project_Using_a_Project-Based_Learning_Assignment_to_Increase_First-Year_College_Students'_Comfort_with_Interdisciplinarity","283094265_Make_space_for_the_Pi","283020016_Developing_a_new_affordable_DC_motor_laboratory_kit_for_an_existing_undergraduate_controls_course","282741776_Future_classroom_with_the_internet_of_things_a_service-oriented_framework","282551844_Bioinstrumentation_A_Project-Based_Engineering_Course"]}
