{"id":"303884143_Graph-FCA_in_Practice","abstract":"With the rise of the Semantic Web, more and more relational data are made available in the form of knowledge graphs (e.g., RDF, conceptual graphs). A challenge is to discover conceptual structures in those graphs, in the same way as Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) discovers conceptual structures in tables. Graph-FCA has been introduced in a previous work as an extension of FCA for such knowledge graphs. In this paper, algorithmic aspects and use cases are explored in order to study the feasibility and usefulness of G-FCA. We consider two use cases. The first one extracts linguistic structures from parse trees, comparing two graph models. The second one extracts workflow patterns from cooking recipes, highlighting the benefits of n-ary relationships and concepts.","authors":["Sébastien Ferré","Peggy Cellier"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-40985-6_9","Conference: International Conference on Conceptual Structures"],"references":["281693326_A_Proposal_for_Extending_Formal_Concept_Analysis_to_Knowledge_Graphs","281326393_Analyzing_inheritance_hierarchies_through_Formal_Concept_Analysis_A_22-years_walk_in_a_landscape_of_conceptual_structures","265547540_Graph_homomorphisms_Structure_and_symmetry","262402264_SPARQL_query_containment_under_RDFS_entailment_regime","257514875_Relational_Concept_Analysis_Mining_Concept_Lattices_From_Multi-Relational_Data","225509941_A_Logical_Generalizationof_Formal_Concept_Analysis","300209826_Analyzing_inheritance_hierarchies_through_Formal_Concept_Analysis","279347205_Formal_Concept_Analysis","265340290_Conceptual_structures_information_processing_in_mind_and_machine","248283828_A_Graph-Based_Approach_to_Knowledge_Representation_Computational_Foundations_of_Conceptual_Graphs_Part_I"]}
