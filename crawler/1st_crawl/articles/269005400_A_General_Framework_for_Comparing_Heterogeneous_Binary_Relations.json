{"id":"269005400_A_General_Framework_for_Comparing_Heterogeneous_Binary_Relations","abstract":"We propose a general framework for measuring the proximity between heterogeneous binary relations. We are particularly interested in equivalence relations (or partitions, or categorical variables) on the one hand, and in order relations (or rankings or ranked data) on the other hand. We study Kendallâ€™s general correlation coefficient that encompasses many statistical association measures for both types of binary relations. Then, we propose a generalization of this approach. Our proposal has several interesting properties. It addresses the case of heterogeneous binary relations, it has a well-motivated geometrical interpretation and it also leads to Euclidean metrics.","authors":["Julien Ah-Pine"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40020-9_19"],"references":["267179270_Some_Measures_of_Agreement_Between_Close_Partitions","221907708_Overview_of_the_Relational_Analysis_approach_in_Data-Mining_and_Multi-criteria_Decision_Making","47280287_On_aggregating_binary_relations_using_0-1_integer_linear_programming","24056133_Metric_and_Euclidean_properties_of_dissimilarity_coefficients","315454089_Rank_Correlation_Methods","292432128_Paradigme_logique_des_ecritures_relationnelles_de_quelques_criteres_fondamentaux_d'association","284882132_Modeles_d'optimisation_en_analyse_des_donnees_relationnelles","284529285_Rank_Correlation_Methods","265527564_Modeles_d'optimisation_en_analyse_des_donnees_relationnelles","265366759_Rank_correlation_methods_2nd_ed_rev_and_enlarged","263609134_Unifying_Some_Association_Criteria_Between_Partitions_by_Using_Relational_Matrices","227596499_Criteria_for_symmetric_measures_of_association_for_nominal_data","220895110_Normalized_Kernels_as_Similarity_Indices","30448691_Modeles_d'optimisation_en_analyse_des_donnees"]}
