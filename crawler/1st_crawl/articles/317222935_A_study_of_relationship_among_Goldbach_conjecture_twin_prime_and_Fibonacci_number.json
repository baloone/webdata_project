{"id":"317222935_A_study_of_relationship_among_Goldbach_conjecture_twin_prime_and_Fibonacci_number","abstract":"In 2015, Liu et al. Proposed a relationship between RSA public key cryptosystem and Goldbach's conjecture properties. In this paper I will examine two other relationship's with Goldbach's conjecture: 1) Goldbach's conjecture and twin ' 2) Goldbach's conjecture and Fibonacci number. I completely list all combination of twin prime in Goldbach conjecture, and propose a very simple method to recognize the prime in Fibonacci sequence. I also give a estimation formula to Goldbach's partition.","authors":["C.
