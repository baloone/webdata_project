{"id":"315437334_Informational_Worldview_Scientific_Foundations_and_Philosophical_Perspectives","abstract":"In the text, I synthetically discuss the cultural background, computer science basis, and philosophical potential of an informational worldview, which I treat as an indirect link between awareness of the significance of contemporary achievements of computer science (its theories and applications) and the philosophy of future (informatism) based on the concept of information. Within the philosophical and cognitive science thread of this work, I focus on informationally-driven questions about the mind (its informational content and computational strategies of modelling) and the complexity of the world (which is directly related to the complexity of problems in which the mind is involved).","authors":["Pawe≈Ç Stacewicz"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1515/slgr-2016-0054"],"references":["346646183_Algorithmics","341438036_Neurophilosophy_Toward_a_Unified_Science_of_the_Mind-Brain","341350392_The_Rediscovery_of_the_Mind","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","275737110_Turing's_Man_Western_Culture_in_the_Computer_Age","267091128_Uber_die_Lange_von_Beweisen","262179151_Human_Problem_Solving","256563555_Neurophilosophy_Toward_a_unified_science_of_the_mind-brain","235700798_Human_problem_solving","226466290_Uber_formal_unentscheidbare_Satze_der_Principia_Mathematica_und_Verwandter_Systeme_I"]}
