{"id":"311313212_Performing_universal_tasks_using_a_mini_iPad_usability_assessment_per_people_with_intellectual_disabilities","abstract":"With this study we aim at assessing if a mini iPad device is a usable option for digital interaction to perform selection, manipulation, and insertion tasks by people with intellectual disabilities. This study builds on previous studies where usability was evaluated for universal tasks using the keyboard and a mouse input device [1]. This allowed us to assess the usability of a small mini iPad and compare it with other two input devices, namely keyboards and the mouse.\nFor usability assessment we registered the following variables: successful conclusion of activities, type of difficulties found, errors and satisfaction indicators. The results showed that this group was much motivated to learn how to handle with the iPad, several asked to repeat the task and no one quit any task requested. Despite the number of errors as registered in their interaction, they always knew how to overcome the error and never showed frustration or demotivation. Furthermore, they had a good performance (relation between variables: time to conclude the task, number of errors and difficulties felt) with the mini iPad device, however when compared with the keyboard and mouse, their performance increased.","authors":["Tania Rocha","Maximino Bessa","Luciana Cabral"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1145/2998626.2998668","Conference: the XVII International Conference"],"references":["305926790_Usability_evaluation_of_navigation_tasks_by_people_with_intellectual_disabilities_a_Google_and_SAPO_comparative_study_regarding_different_interaction_modalities","301548427_Performing_universal_tasks_on_the_Web_interaction_with_digital_content_by_people_with_intellectual_disabilities","269698154_Different_interaction_paradigms_for_different_user_groups_an_evaluation_regarding_content_selection","264002212_Accessibility_and_Usability_on_the_Internet_for_people_with_intellectual_disabilities","232231887_The_Recognition_of_Web_Pages'_Hyperlinks_by_People_with_Intellectual_Disabilities_An_Evaluation_Study","260584349_The_Human_Factors_of_Computer_Graphics_Interaction_Techniques","236017807_Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders_DSM-V","227755747_How_people_with_developmental_disabilities_navigate_the_Internet","221517868_Web_accessibility_for_people_with_cognitive_disabilities","221474950_Determining_the_benefits_of_direct-touch_bimanual_and_multifinger_input_on_a_multitouch_workstation"]}
