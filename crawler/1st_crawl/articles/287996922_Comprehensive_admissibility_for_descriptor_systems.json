{"id":"287996922_Comprehensive_admissibility_for_descriptor_systems","abstract":"This paper presents a complete solution to the problem of comprehensive admissibility for descriptor systems with unstable and nonproper weights. In such non-standard circumstances, it is hard to render the closed-loop system admissible due to the uncontrollable and unobservable weights. The necessary and sufficient condition is given and a specifically structured output feedback controller is conducted in terms of the dynamics of the weighs. It is shown that determining suitable controllers for a given descriptor system with the presence of unstable and nonproper weights requires solving an admissibility problem for an augmented system explicitly constructed in this paper. A numerical example is included to illustrate the current result.","authors":["Yu Feng","Mohamed Yagoubi"],"meta":["January 2016Automatica 66:271-275","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2016.01.028"],"references":["270766038_Observers_and_Observer-Based_Control_for_Descriptor_Systems_Revisited","260508801_On_state_feedback_Hinfinity_control_for_discrete-time_singular_systems","256660730_H_control_with_unstable_and_nonproper_weights_for_descriptor_systems","251724095_Parametrization_of_extended_stabilizing_controllers_for_continuous-time_descriptor_systems","268859111_Robust_Control_and_Filtering_of_Singular_Systems","266704143_Analysis_and_Design_of_Descriptor_Linear_Systems","266289066_Robust_control_and_H-optimization-Tutorial_paper","242795411_Extended_H_control_-_H_control_with_unstable_weights","242795260_Unstable_and_nonproper_weights_in_H_control","242717408_Robust_Control_Toolbox_3_User's_Guide"]}
