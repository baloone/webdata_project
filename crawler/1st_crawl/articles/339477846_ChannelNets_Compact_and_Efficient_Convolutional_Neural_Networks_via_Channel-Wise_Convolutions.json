{"id":"339477846_ChannelNets_Compact_and_Efficient_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_via_Channel-Wise_Convolutions","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great capability of solving various artificial intelligence tasks. However, the increasing model size has raised challenges in employing them in resource-limited applications. In this work, we propose to compress deep models by using channel-wise convolutions, which replace dense connections among feature maps with sparse ones in CNNs. Based on this novel operation, we build light-weight CNNs known as ChannelNets. ChannelNets use three instances of channel-wise convolutions; namely group channel-wise convolutions, depth-wise separable channel-wise convolutions, and the convolutional classification layer. Compared to prior CNNs designed for mobile devices, ChannelNets achieve a significant reduction in terms of the number of parameters and computational cost without loss in accuracy. Notably, our work represents the first attempt to compress the fully-connected classification layer, which usually accounts for about 25% of total parameters in compact CNNs. Along this new direction, we investigate the behavior of our proposed convolutional classification layer and conduct detailed analysis. Based on our in-depth analysis, we further propose convolutional classification layers without weight-sharing. This new classification layer achieves a good trade-off between fully-connected classification layers and the convolutional classification layer. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ChannelNets achieve consistently better performance compared to prior methods.","authors":["Hongyang Gao","Zhengyang Wang","Lei Cai","Shuiwang Ji"],"meta":["February 2020IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2020.2975796","Project: Model Compression"],"references":["329747614_CondenseNet_An_Efficient_DenseNet_Using_Learned_Group_Convolutions","327513283_ChannelNets_Compact_and_Efficient_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_via_Channel-Wise_Convolutions","322749812_SegNet_A_Deep_Convolutional_Encoder-Decoder_Architecture_for_Image_Segmentation","338510249_MnasNet_Platform-Aware_Neural_Architecture_Search_for_Mobile","338504030_Building_Efficient_Deep_Neural_Networks_With_Unitary_Group_Convolutions","329740202_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","329740172_ShuffleNet_An_Extremely_Efficient_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Mobile_Devices","329602858_Deep_Neural_Network_Compression_by_In-Parallel_Pruning-Quantization","329131899_Deep_Variational_and_Structural_Hashing","328153791_Shallowing_Deep_Networks_Layer-Wise_Pruning_Based_on_Feature_Representations"]}
