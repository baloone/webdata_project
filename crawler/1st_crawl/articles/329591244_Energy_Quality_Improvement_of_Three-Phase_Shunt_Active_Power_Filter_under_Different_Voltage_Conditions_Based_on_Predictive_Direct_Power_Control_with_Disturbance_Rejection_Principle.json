It is characterized by a high transient dynamic, which makes it an interesting alternative for conventional direct power control (DPC). Furthermore, in the existence of a non-linear load, the source currents would become highly distorted under perturbed and unbalanced voltage grid conditions. In order to resolve the problems mentioned above, the present paper proposes an improved P-DPC control for APF based on disturbance rejection principle, which is able to operate under balanced, unbalanced and distorted grid voltages conditions and can attain sinusoidal source currents with a respectable total harmonic distortion (THD) meets with IEEE-519 standard. Simulation results and comparative study are presented to confirm the efficiency of the proposed approaches.","authors":["Sabir Ouchen","Jean-Paul Gaubert","Heinrich Steinhart","Achour Betka"],"meta":["December 2018Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 158(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.matcom.2018.11.024","Project: active filtering of a photovoltaic system connected to the network"],"references":["308873078_Experimental_comparison_of_DPC_and_VOC_control_of_a_three-level_NPC_grid_connected_converter","305767107_Design_and_Experimental_Validation_Study_on_Direct_Power_Control_Applied_on_Active_Power_Filter","351089388_Direct_Power_Control_Switching_Table_Concept_and_Analysis_for_Three-Phase_Shunt_Active_Power_Filter","315316687_Table-based_DPC_for_grid_connected_VSC_under_unbalanced_and_distorted_grid_voltages_Review_and_optimal_method","307155488_Experimental_validation_of_sliding_mode-predictive_direct_power_control_of_a_grid_connected_photovoltaic_system_feeding_a_nonlinear_load","303980057_Fuzzy-predictive_direct_power_control_implementation_of_a_grid_connected_photovoltaic_system_associated_with_an_active_power_filter","303462570_Experimental_Validation_of_Active_Power_Filtering_With_a_Simple_Robust_Control","298091674_Handbook_of_Power_Quality","282351582_Real_time_simulation_and_experimental_validation_of_active_power_filter_operation_and_control","280613348_Design_and_real_time_implementation_of_fuzzy_switched_controller_for_single_phase_active_power_filter"]}
