{"id":"228616759_Term_representation_with_Generalized_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","abstract":"Document indexing and representation of term-document relations are very important issues for document clustering and retrieval. In this paper, we present Generalized Latent Seman-tic Analysis as a framework for computing se-mantically motivated term and document vec-tors. Our focus on term vectors is motivated by the recent success of co-occurrence based mea-sures of semantic similarity obtained from very large corpora. Our experiments demonstrate that GLSA term vectors efficiently capture se-mantic relations between terms and outperform related approaches on the synonymy test.","authors":["Irina Matveeva","Gina-Anne Levow","Ayman Farahat","Christiaan Royer"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1075/cilt.292.08mat"],"references":["221620547_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","221112660_Mining_the_web_for_synonyms_PMI-IR_versus_LSA_on_TOEFL","220500224_Nonlinear_Component_Analysis_as_a_Kernel_Eigenvalue_Problem","1957648_Human-Level_Performance_on_Word_Analogy_Questions_by_Latent_Relational_Analysis","298836450_Automatic_word_sense_discrimination","248259011_Using_Bag-of-Concepts_to_Improve_the_Performance_of_Support_Vector_Machines_in_Text_Categorization","222301641_Dictionary-based_techniques_for_cross-language_information_retrieval_Information_Processing_and_Management_413_523-547","221301217_Locality_Preserving_Indexing_for_Document_Representation_The","221299086_Document_Clustering_Based_On_Non-negative_Matrix_Factorization","221013129_VerbOcean_Mining_the_Web_for_Fine-Grained_Semantic_Verb_Relations","220688577_Introduction_To_Modern_Information_Retrieval","200045221_A_solution_to_Plato's_problem_The_latent_semantic_analysis_theory_of_acquisition_induction_and_representation_of_knowledge","200038880_Laplacian_Eigenmaps_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Data_Representation","2934925_A_Parallel_Eigensolver_for_Dense_Symmetric_Matrices_Based_on_Multiple_Relatively_Robust_Representations","2873938_Frequency_Estimates_for_Statistical_Word_Similarity_Measures","2709510_A_Language_Modeling_Approach_to_Information_Retrieval","2662882_Latent_Semantic_Indexing_is_an_Optimal_Special_Case_of_Multidimensional_Scaling","2429508_Latent_Semantic_Space_Iterative_Scaling_Improves_Precision_of_Inter-document_Similarity_Measurement","2374126_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation"]}
