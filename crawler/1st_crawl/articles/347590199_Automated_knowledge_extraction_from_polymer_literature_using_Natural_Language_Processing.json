{"id":"347590199_Automated_knowledge_extraction_from_polymer_literature_using_Natural_Language_Processing","abstract":"Materials science literature has grown exponentially in recent years making it difficult for individuals to master all of this information. This constrains the formulation of new hypotheses that scientists can come up with. In this work, we explore whether materials science knowledge can be automatically inferred from textual information contained in journal papers. Using a dataset of 0.5 million polymer papers, we show, using natural language processing methods that vector representations trained for every word in our corpus can indeed capture this knowledge in a completely unsupervised manner. We perform time-based studies through which we track popularity of various polymers for different applications and predict new polymers for novel applications based solely on the domain knowledge contained in our dataset. Using co-relations detected automatically from literature in this manner thus, opens up a new paradigm for materials discovery.","authors":["Pranav Shetty","Rampi Ramprasad"],"meta":["December 2020iScience 24(1):101922","DOI:10.1016/j.isci.2020.101922"],"references":["336978633_Complex_dielectric_behavior_of_doped_polyaniline_conducting_polymer_at_microwave_frequencies_using_time_domain_reflectometry","334984921_A_Review_on_Porous_Polymeric_Membrane_Preparation_Part_II_Production_Techniques_with_Polyethylene_Polydimethylsiloxane_Polypropylene_Polyimide_and_Polytetrafluoroethylene","334209824_Unsupervised_word_embeddings_capture_latent_knowledge_from_materials_science_literature","338455121_Polypyrole_polyaniline_and_sodium_alginate_biocomposites_and_adsorption-desorption_efficiency_for_imidacloprid_insecticide","334775636_Named_Entity_Recognition_and_Normalization_Applied_to_Large-Scale_Information_Extraction_from_the_Materials_Science_Literature","332536841_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Zeolite_Synthesis_Enabled_by_Automatic_Literature_Data_Extraction","326385726_Polymer_Genome_A_Data-Powered_Polymer_Informatics_Platform_for_Property_Predictions","320507500_Materials_Synthesis_Insights_from_Scientific_Literature_via_Text_Extraction_and_Machine_Learning","313330946_Sensor_development_of_12_Dichlorobenzene_based_on_polypyroleCu-doped_ZnO_PPYCZO_nanocomposite_embedded_silver_electrode_and_their_antimicrobial_studies","308820268_Support_vector_machines_and_Word2vec_for_text_classification_with_semantic_features"]}
