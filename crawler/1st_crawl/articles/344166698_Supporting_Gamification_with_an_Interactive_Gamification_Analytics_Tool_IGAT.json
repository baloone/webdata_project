{"id":"344166698_Supporting_Gamification_with_an_Interactive_Gamification_Analytics_Tool_IGAT","abstract":"We present the design, implementation, and early evaluation results of the Interactive Gamification Analytics Tool (IGAT) for the learning management system Moodle. IGAT incorporates key Gamification Analytics aspects and provides teachers and gamification designers insights into the students' interaction in a gamified learning environment. It includes various metrics on students' activity on the gamification dashboard as well as statistics on the game elements usage. Additionally, IGAT supports students understanding of how and why game elements are incorporated in the learning process to support them.","authors":["Nadja Zaric","Manuel Gottschlich","René Röpke","Ulrik Schroeder"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-57717-9_45","Conference: 15th European Conference on Technology-Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL)At: Heidelberg, Germany","Project: Gamification in personalized e-learning"],"references":["278681698_Gamification_in_Education_and_Business","270273830_Gamification_in_Education_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","311999418_Gamification_Analytics-Methods_and_Tools_for_Monitoring_and_Adapting_Gamification_Designs"]}
