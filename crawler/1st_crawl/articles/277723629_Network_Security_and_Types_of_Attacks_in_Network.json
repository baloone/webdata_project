{"id":"277723629_Network_Security_and_Types_of_Attacks_in_Network","abstract":"The computer network technology is developing rapidly, and the development of internet technology is more quickly, people more aware of the importance of the network security. Network security is main issue of computing because many types of attacks are increasing day by day. In mobile ad-hoc network the nodes are independent. Protecting computer and network security are critical issues. The malicious nodes create a problem in the network. This malicious nodes acts as selfishness, It can use the resources of other nodes and preserve the resources of its own. After analyzing and quantifying the network information security elements confidentiality, integrity and availability, this paper describes the network security confidentiality vector, network security integrity vector and network security availability vector; also we present some major type of attacks in MANET.","authors":["Mohan V Pawar","J.
