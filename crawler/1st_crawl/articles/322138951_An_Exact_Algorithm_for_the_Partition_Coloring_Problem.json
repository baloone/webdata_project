{"id":"322138951_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Partition_Coloring_Problem","abstract":"We study the Partition Coloring Problem (PCP), a generalization of the Vertex Coloring Problem where the vertex set is partitioned. The PCP asks to select one vertex for each subset of the partition in such a way that the chromatic number of the induced graph is minimum. We propose a new Integer Linear Programming formulation with an exponential number of variables. To solve this formulation to optimality, we design an effective Branch-and-Price algorithm. Good quality initial solutions are computed via a new metaheuristic algorithm based on adaptive large neighborhood search. Extensive computational experiments on a benchmark test of instances from the literature show that our Branch-and-Price algorithm, combined with the new metaheuristic algorithm, is able to solve for the first time to proven optimality several open instances, and compares favorably with the current state-of-the-art exact algorithm.","authors":["Fabio Furini","Enrico Malaguti","Alberto Santini"],"meta":["December 2017Computers & Operations Research 92","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2017.12.019"],"references":["325369748_A_comparison_of_acceptance_criteria_for_the_adaptive_large_neighbourhood_search_metaheuristic","309822984_Solving_vertex_coloring_problems_as_maximum_weight_stable_set_problems","257658033_Exact_weighted_vertex_coloring_via_branch-and-price","321515062_A_Guide_to_Graph_Colouring","286214309_On_some_properties_of_linear_complexes","284084779_On_the_minimum_and_maximum_selective_graph_coloring_problems_in_some_graph_classes","264550133_On_Some_Applications_Of_The_Selective_Graph_Coloring_Problem","257786613_Maximum-Weight_Stable_Sets_and_Safe_Lower_Bounds_For_Graph_Coloring","250927254_Perfectness_of_clustered_graphs","248580976_The_graph_coloring_problem_A_bibliographic_survey"]}
