{"id":"284543783_Software_Engineering_Economics","abstract":"A summary is presented of the current state of the art and recent trends in software engineering economics. It provides an overview of economic analysis techniques and their applicability to software engineering and management. It surveys the field of software cost estimation, including the major estimation techniques available, the state of the art in algorithmic cost models, and the outstanding research issues in software cost estimation.","authors":["Barry Boehm"],"meta":["January 1981IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 10(1):4-21","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-48354-7_5"],"references":["279601776_Measures_of_programming_complexity","38008709_A_model_of_software_project_management_dynamics","23865798_Deep_space_network_software_cost_estimation_model","313401756_Estimating_software_costs","303112223_A_general_empirical_solution_to_the_macrosoftware_sizing_and_estimating_problem","277751849_RESEARCH_IN_THE_MANAGEMENT_OF_COMPUTER_PROGRAMMING","258138248_Goals_and_Performance_in_Computer_Programming","248794857_Software_cost_estimation_study_-_study_results","243628960_System_evolution_dynamics_of_VME","242530080_Estimating_Resources_for_Large_Programming_Systems","242484728_The_characteristics_of_large_systems","242410193_Price_software_model-version_3_An_overview","239568755_Tutorial_on_models_and_metrics_for_software_management_engineering","238190984_Applying_software_complexity_measures_to_program_mainte-nance","235978042_Measuring_Application_Development_Productivity","235209114_BCS_Software_Production_Data","235154573_An_Evaluation_of_Software_Cost_Estimating_Models","235043244_Management_Handbook_for_Estimation_of_Computer_Programming_Costs","224102549_A_method_of_program_measurement_and_estimation","221560777_Analytics_for_software_development","221555926_The_TRW_Software_Productivity_System","221555619_Program_Complexity_Measure_for_Software_Development_Management","221554328_M_H_Halstead's_Software_Science_-_A_Critical_Examination","221554177_A_Model_for_Estimating_Program_Size_and_Its_Evaluation","220376524_A_model_of_the_software_development_process","220375700_Programming_methodology_organizational_environment_and_programming_productivity","220071260_Putnam_LH_A_General_Empirical_Solution_to_the_Macro_Software_Sizing_and_Estimating_Problem_IEEE_Transactions_on_Software_Engineering_44_345-361","220070444_A_Complexity_Measure","44722658_The_Economics_of_information_processing_Robert_Goldberg_Harol","3799219_Example_of_an_early_sizing_cost_and_schedule_estimate_for_an_application_software_system","3189025_A_Complexity_Measure","3046257_The_Cost_of_Developing_Large-Scale_Software","2995854_Programs_life_cycles_and_laws_of_software_evolution"]}
