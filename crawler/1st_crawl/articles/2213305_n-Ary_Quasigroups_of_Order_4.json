{"id":"2213305_n-Ary_Quasigroups_of_Order_4","abstract":"We characterize the set of all N-ary quasigroups of order 4: every N-ary quasigroup of order 4 is permutably reducible or semilinear. Permutable reducibility means that an N-ary quasigroup can be represented as a composition of K-ary and (N-K+1)-ary quasigroups for some K from 2 to N-1, where the order of arguments in the representation can differ from the original order. The set of semilinear N-ary quasigroups has a characterization in terms of Boolean functions.
