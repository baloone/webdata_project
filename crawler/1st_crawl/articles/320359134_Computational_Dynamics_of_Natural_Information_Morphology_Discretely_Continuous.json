{"id":"320359134_Computational_Dynamics_of_Natural_Information_Morphology_Discretely_Continuous","abstract":"This paper presents a theoretical study of the binary oppositions underlying the mechanisms of natural computation understood as dynamical processes on natural information morphologies. Of special interest are the oppositions of discrete vs. continuous, structure vs. process, and differentiation vs. integration. The framework used is that of computing nature, where all natural processes at different levels of organisation are computations over informational structures. The interactions at different levels of granularity/organisation in nature, and the character of the phenomena that unfold through those interactions, are modeled from the perspective of an observing agent. This brings us to the movement from binary oppositions to dynamic networks built upon mutually related binary oppositions, where each node has several properties.","authors":["Gordana Dodig Crnkovic"],"meta":["October 2017Philosophies 2(4):23","DOI:10.3390/philosophies2040023","Project: Morphological Computing in Cognitive Systems"],"references":["319398324_Reality_Construction_in_Cognitive_Agents_Through_Processes_of_Info-computation","318019537_Computational_Aspects_of_Model-Based_Reasoning","311627189_Nature_as_a_Network_of_Morphological_Infocomputational_Processes_for_Cognitive_Agents_THE_EUROPEAN_PHYSICAL_JOURNAL_SPECIAL_TOPICS","272890734_Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy's_Organismic_View_on_the_Theory_of_Evolution","338529424_Fundamentals_of_Language","321555992_Logos_and_Life_Creative_Experience_and_the_Critique_of_Reason_Introduction_to_the_Phenomenology_of_Life_and_the_Human_Condition","318666474_The_Natural_Science_of_Computing","313561092_Dualism_of_selective_and_structural_information_in_modelling_dynamics_of_information","300660261_The_Law_of_Opposites_in_the_Ontopoiesis_of_Life_and_in_Language","274810678_Steps_to_an_Ecology_of_Mind"]}
