{"id":"315487360_The_Future_of_Industrial_Communication_Automation_Networks_in_the_Era_of_the_Internet_of_Things_and_Industry_40","abstract":"With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyberphysical system (CPS) concepts in industrial application scenarios, industrial automation is undergoing a tremendous change. This is made possible in part by recent advances in technology that allow interconnection on a wider and more fine-grained scale. The purpose of this article is to review technological trends and the impact they may have on industrial communication. We will review the impact of IoT and CPSs on industrial automation from an industry 4.0 perspective, give a survey of the current state of work on Ethernet time-sensitive networking (TSN), and shed light on the role of fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks in automation. Moreover, we will point out the need for harmonization beyond networking.","authors":["Martin Wollschlaeger","Thilo Sauter","Juergen Jasperneite"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine 11(1):17 - 27","DOI:10.1109/MIE.2017.2649104","Project: Intelligent Automation Technologies"],"references":["321538522_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Applications_of_Industrial_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","311417319_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Applications_of_Industrial_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","310823803_A_Review_of_Technology_Standards_and_Patent_Portfolios_for_Enabling_Cyber-Physical_Systems_in_Advanced_Manufacturing","309757619_Approach_to_interconnect_existing_industrial_automation_systems_with_the_Industrial_Internet","302919495_Software-Defined_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_in_the_Context_of_Industry_40","283522100_Novel_trends_in_automotive_networks_A_perspective_on_Ethernet_and_the_IEEE_Audio_Video_Bridging","282936902_Survey_on_real-time_communication_via_Ethernet_in_industrial_automation_environments","276127288_Strategies_and_Services_for_Energy_Efficiency_in_Real-Time_Ethernet_Networks","273139405_An_Analysis_of_Real-Time_Ethernets_With_Regard_to_Their_Automatic_Configuration","263285662_Industrie_40_Hit_or_Hype_Industry_Forum","261203734_Comparative_assessments_of_IEEE_802154ZigBee_and_6LoWPAN_for_low-power_industrial_WSNs_in_realistic_scenarios","261161659_Scalability_of_OPC-UA_down_to_the_chip_level_enables_Internet_of_Things","224115870_Adaptation_of_resource-oriented_service_technologies_for_industrial_informatics","224087268_Towards_new_hybrid_networks_for_industrial_automation","224087267_A_performance_study_of_Ethernet_Audio_Video_Bridging_AVB_for_Industrial_real-time_communication","309964964_Guest_Editorial_Special_Section_on_Communication_in_Automation","309759847_Network_models_for_the_industrial_intranet","309759783_Test_and_on-line_monitoring_of_real-time_Ethernet_with_mixed_pysical_layer_for_Industry_40","309407577_Internet_of_Things_and_Edge_Cloud_Computing_Roadmap_for_Manufacturing","309056656_The_Economics_and_Strategy_of_Manufacturing_and_the_Cloud","308954414_Agent_and_Cyber-Physical_System_Based_Self-Organizing_and_Self-Adaptive_Intelligent_Shopfloor","308845289_Open_cloud_solution_for_integrating_advanced_process_control_in_plant_operation","308671611_Architectural_Considerations_for_a_Centralized_Global_IoT_Platform","301571754_Integration_of_Classical_Components_Into_Industrial_Cyber-Physical_Systems","301571677_Industrial_Cyber-Physical_Systems_Scanning_the_Issue","299524200_Guest_Editorial_Industrial_Wireless_Networks_Applications_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","296684105_Using_Smart_Edge_IoT_Devices_for_Safer_Rapid_Response_With_Industry_IoT_Control_Operations","296473508_Scheduling_for_Source_Relaying_With_Packet_Aggregation_in_Industrial_Wireless_Networks","291018800_Automatic_Packing_Mechanism_for_Simplification_of_the_Scheduling_in_Profinet_IRT","285630112_On_the_Use_of_IEEE_80211n_for_Industrial_Communications","261320981_Prototyping_the_Internet_of_Things_for_the_future_factory_using_a_SOA-based_middleware_and_reliable_WSNs","260625558_Industrial_Wireless_Networks_The_Significance_of_Timeliness_in_Communication_Systems","259779074_Synchronize_Your_Watches_Part_II_Special-Purpose_Solutions_for_Distributed_Real-Time_Control","241194290_The_Evolution_of_Factory_and_Building_Automation","224401615_A_Proposal_for_a_Generic_Real-Time_Ethernet_System","224332905_A_new_approach_for_increasing_the_performance_of_the_industrial_Ethernet_system_PROFINET","224163349_The_Three_Generations_of_Field-Level_Networks-Evolution_and_Compatibility_Issues","224146237_The_Roots_of_Automation_Before_Mechatronics","220366254_How_to_Access_Factory_Floor_Information_Using_Internet_Technologies_and_Gateways","220366216_Functional_Analysis_of_Manufacturing_Execution_System_Distribution","3481205_Hybrid_WiredWireless_Networks_for_Real-Time_Communications","3481119_The_continuing_evolution_of_integration_in_manufacturing_automation"]}
