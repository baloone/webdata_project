{"id":"227001577_Examining_the_Effects_of_Parental_Absence_on_the_Academic_Achievement_of_Adolescents_The_Challenge_of_Controlling_for_Family_Income","abstract":"Increasingly, researchers are concerned about how to best control for family income when examining the effects of parental divorce and the death of a parent on the children's academic achievement. Some researchers have argued that a predissolution control is preferable over a postdissolution control for family income, because parental divorce or the death of a parent nearly always causes family income reduction. Using the National Educational Longitudinal Study 1988â€“92 data set, this study has examined whether using a predissolution control for family income yields a different pattern of effects from when a postdissolution control is used. The results indicate that using a predissolution control rather than a postdissolution control for family income does yield a different pattern of effects.","authors":["William H.
