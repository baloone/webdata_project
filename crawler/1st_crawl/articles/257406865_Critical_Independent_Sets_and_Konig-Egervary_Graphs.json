{"id":"257406865_Critical_Independent_Sets_and_Konig-Egervary_Graphs","abstract":"A set S of vertices is independent or stable in a graph G, and we write S ∈ Ind (G), if no two vertices from S are adjacent, and α(G) is the cardinality of an independent set of maximum size, while core(G) denotes the intersection of all maximum independent sets. G is called a König–Egerváry graph if its order equals α(G) + μ(G), where μ(G) denotes the size of a maximum matching. The number def (G) = | V(G) | −2μ(G) is the deficiency of G. The number \\({d(G)=\\max\\{\\left\\vert S\\right\\vert -\\left\\vert N(S)\\right\\vert :S\\in\\mathrm{Ind}(G)\\}}\\) is the critical difference of G. An independent set A is critical if \\({\\left\\vert A\\right\\vert -\\left\\vert N(A)\\right\\vert =d(G)}\\) , where N(S) is the neighborhood of S, and α\nc\n(G) denotes the maximum size of a critical independent set. Larson (Eur J Comb 32:294–300, 2011) demonstrated that G is a König–Egerváry graph if and only if there exists a maximum independent set that is also critical, i.e., α\nc\n(G) = α(G). In this paper we prove that: (i) \\({d(G)=\\left \\vert \\mathrm{core}(G) \\right \\vert -\\left \\vert N (\\mathrm{core}(G))\\right\\vert =\\alpha(G)-\\mu(G)=def \\left(G\\right)}\\) holds for every König–Egerváry graph G; (ii) G is König–Egerváry graph if and only if each maximum independent set of G is critical.","authors":["Vadim Levit","Eugen Mandrescu"],"meta":["January 2009Graphs and Combinatorics 28(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-011-1037-y","SourcearXiv","Project: Critical independent sets"],"references":["226831014_Ear-decompositions_of_matching-covered_graphs","284266939_On_combinatorial_properties_of_matrices","283559921_Paths_trees_flowers","267672253_Well-covered_and_Koenig-Egervary_graphs","228991216_A_note_on_critical_independence_reductions","226900103_Vertex_Packings_Structural_Properties_and_Algorithms","225873252_Node-weighted_graphs_having_the_Konig-Egervary_property","223707566_A_generalization_of_Konig-Egervary_graphs_and_heuristics_for_the_maximum_independent_set_problem_with_improved_approximation_ratios","223068640_On_a-stable_Konig-Egervary_graphs","222948785_On_-critical_edges_in_Konig-Egervary_graphs"]}
