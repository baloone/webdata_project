{"id":"273394866_An_Overview_of_Internet_of_Vehicles","abstract":"The new era of the Internet of Things is driving the evolution of conventional Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). With the rapid development of computation and communication technologies, IoV promises huge commercial interest and research value, thereby attracting a large number of companies and researchers. This paper proposes an abstract network model of the IoV, discusses the technologies required to create the IoV, presents different applications based on certain currently existing technologies, provides several open research challenges and describes essential future research in the area of IoV.","authors":["Yang Fangchun","Shangguang Wang","Jinglin Li","Zhihan Liu"],"meta":["October 2014China Communications 11(10):1-15","DOI:10.1109/CC.2014.6969789"],"references":["307475482_Improving_QoS_in_VANET_using_MPLS","274151315_End-to-end_Delay_Assessment_and_Hybrid_Routing_Protocol_for_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Network","290325489_Internet_of_vehicles_the_framework_and_key_technology","269032355_GeoSVR_A_geographic_stateless_VANET_routing","265555609_Theory_Analysis_of_the_Handover_Challenge_in_Express_Train_Access_Networks_ETAN","264984071_A_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_Based_on_Intelligent_Batteries_Transfer_Management_for_the_EV_Network","262922652_A_systematic_review_on_routing_protocols_for_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks","261417622_Augmenting_vehicular_3G_users_through_inter-vehicle_communications","261078009_Delay_Analysis_and_Study_of_IEEE_80211p_based_DSRC_Safety_Communication_in_a_Highway_Environment","260636609_When_3G_meets_VANET_3G-assisted_data_delivery_in_VANETs"]}
