{"id":"257458253_Resistance_Is_Futile_Reading_Science_Fiction_alongside_Ubiquitous_Computing","abstract":"Design-oriented research is an act of collective imaginingâ€”a way in which we work together to bring about a future that lies slightly out of our grasp. In this paper, we examine the collective imagining of ubiquitous computing by bringing it into alignment with a related phenomenon, science fiction, in particular as imagined by a series of television shows that form part of the cultural backdrop for many members of the research community. A comparative reading of these fictional narratives highlights a series of themes that are also implicit in the research literature. We argue both that these themes are important considerations in the shaping of technological design and that an attention to the tropes of popular culture holds methodological value for ubiquitous computing.","authors":["Paul Dourish","Genevieve Bell"],"meta":["April 2014Personal and Ubiquitous Computing 18(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00779-013-0678-7"],"references":["220141795_Yesterday's_Tomorrows_Notes_on_Ubiquitous_Computing's_Dominant_Vision","3436914_Wearable_computers_No_longer_science_fiction","312985209_Up_the_anthropologist_perspectives_gained_from_studying_up_In_Reinventing_anthropology","284411684_Up_the_Anthropologist-Perspectives_Gained_from_Studying_Up","282003885_In_the_Realm_of_the_Diamond_Queen","274348113_The_Magic_of_the_State","273716264_Four_African_Political_Systems","249562241_The_Science_Fiction_of_Technoscience_The_Politics_of_Simulation_and_a_Challenge_for_New_Media_Art","249177800_Anthropology_and_Science_Fiction","249038454_Captain_Video_Television's_First_Fantastic_Voyage","247202435_The_Political_Systems_of_Highland_Burma","240650971_Blurred_Boundaries_The_Discourse_of_Corruption_the_Culture_of_Politics_and_the_Imagined_State","239061068_The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe","238345519_The_Places_of_Books_in_the_Age_of_Electronic_Reproduction","237132779_NASATrek_Popular_science_and_sex_in_America","237005390_Hitch_Hikers_Guide_to_the_Galaxy","234147732_Ethnography_InOf_the_World_System_The_Emergence_of_Multi-Sited_Ethnography","233445533_Weapons_of_the_Weak_Everyday_Forms_of_Peasant_Resistance","200456918_Anthropology_and_Mass_Media","40542347_Resistance_and_Contradiction_Miskitu_Indians_and_the_Nicaraguan_State_1894-1987"]}
