{"id":"317934887_An_Novel_Protocol_for_the_Quantum_Secure_Multi-Party_Summation_Based_on_Two-Particle_Bell_States","abstract":"A protocol for the quantum secure multi-party summation based on two-particle Bell states is proposed. In this protocol, two-particle Bell states are used as private information carriers. Without using the entangled character of Bell states, we also use Pauli matrices operations to encode information and Hadamard matrix to extract information. The proposed protocol can also resist various attacks and overcomes the problem of information leakage with acceptable efficiency. In theory, our protocol can be used to build complex secure protocols for other multiparty computations and also lots of other important applications in distributed networks.","authors":["Wen Liu","Yong-Bin Wang","Wen-Qin Fan"],"meta":["September 2017International Journal of Theoretical Physics 56(1):1-9","DOI:10.1007/s10773-017-3442-3"],"references":["307875651_Dynamic_Multi-Party_Quantum_Private_Comparison_Protocol_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","291420684_Secure_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_for_Summation_and_Multiplication","301279477_Practical_quantum_private_query_with_better_performance_in_resisting_joint-measurement_attack","293178577_Secure_multiparty_quantum_summation","282951983_QKD-based_quantum_private_query_without_a_failure_probability","282054196_A_simple_participant_attack_on_the_Bradler-Dusek_protocol","276455918_Three-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party","275671831_Quantum_Multi-party_Private_Comparison_Protocol_using_d-dimensional_Bell_States","261884284_A_Quantum_Protocol_for_Millionaire_Problem_with_Continuous_Variables","260530145_Multi-party_Quantum_Private_Comparison_Protocol_Using_d-Dimensional_Basis_States_Without_Entanglement_Swapping","257641706_A_quantum_protocol_for_millionaire_problem_with_Bell_states","260456504_High-Capacity_Quantum_Summation_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","257641919_Quantum_private_comparison_protocol_based_on_entanglement_swapping_of_-level_Bell_states","257641650_Quantum_private_comparison_protocol_with_d-dimensional_Bell_states","257572357_New_Quantum_Private_Comparison_Protocol_Using_X-Type_State"]}
