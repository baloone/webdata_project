{"id":"331057932_Spiderweb_strategy_Application_for_area_coverage_with_mobile_sensor_nodes_in_3D_wireless_sensor_network","abstract":"The problem of area coverage in 3D wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a NP-Hard problem. The approaches used to optimise this problem are not effective due to the difficulty of ensuring 3D connectivity, communication, and monitoring. The fundamental issue of all these constraints is the difficulty of deploying the sensor nodes with fair densities on the 3D areas, in order to guarantee the connectivity and the coverage over all the network. In this paper, we will mimic the spider techniques to texture their web to the movements of their enemies, and to hunt their prey, to ensure the 3D coverage inside WSNs. Indeed, spider web are made to catch insects and they have remarkable strength and resilience. The mobility of the sensor nodes, according to Archimedesâ€™ spiral function, facilitates the proper node positioning. Positioning the mobile sensor nodes by miming a spider canvas in 3D ensures the equitable distribution of nodes in the area of interest (AoI). Moreover, the ability to vary communication and surveillance radii ensures the connectivity and the entire coverage. We have made some simulations to assess performance of our algorithms. Our simulation shows that the spider canvas strategy outperforms the area coverage in 3D scheme in both effectiveness and efficiency.","authors":["Sia Adda Boualem","Youcef Dahmani","Cyril De Runz","Marwane Ayaida"],"meta":["January 2019International Journal of Sensor Networks 29(2):121","DOI:10.1504/IJSNET.2019.097808","Project: Area Coverage in WSN by uncertain theories"],"references":["320369547_Quantizer_Design_for_Generalized_Locally-Optimum_Detectors_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","318702150_Node_Deployment_Strategies_and_Coverage_Prediction_in_3D_Wireless_Sensor_Network_with_Scheduling","314605052_Generalized_Rao_Test_for_Decentralized_Detection_of_an_Uncooperative_Target","311736900_Distributed_Detection_of_a_Non-cooperative_Target_via_Generalized_Locally-optimum_Approaches","224251951_Distributed_classification_of_multiple_moving_targets_with_binary_wireless_sensor_networks","309912347_A_Study_of_Wireless_Mobile_Sensor_Network_Deployment","308601107_Energy_efficient_aggregate_monitoring_for_sensor_fields_with_time-varying_statistics","260111303_Ant_colony_optimization_with_greedy_migration_mechanism_for_node_deployment_in_wireless_sensor_networks","246746952_Maintaining_Sensing_Coverage_and_Connectivity_in_Large_Sensor_Networks","224113018_Wireless_sensor_deployment_for_3D_coverage_with_constraints"]}
