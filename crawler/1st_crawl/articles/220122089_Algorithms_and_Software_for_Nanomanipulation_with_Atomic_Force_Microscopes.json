{"id":"220122089_Algorithms_and_Software_for_Nanomanipulation_with_Atomic_Force_Microscopes","abstract":"Interactive manipulation of nanoparticles by mechanically pushing them with the tip of an AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) is now done routinely at many laboratories around the world. However, a human in the loop introduces significant inaccuracies and results in a very slow process, mostly because of the need for locating the particles before and after manipulation operations, in the presence of large spatial uncertainties which are often comparable to the size of the particles. This paper describes the nanomanipulation systems developed at USC's Laboratory for Molecular Robotics over the last decade, culminating in a fully automatic system that is capable of accurately positioning small nanoparticles, with diameters ~ 10 nm. This system uses software compensators for the nonlinearities inherent in the piezoelectric actuators used in most AFMs. The planner and execution systems are described, as well as the software architecture of the systems. Experimental results are presented that validate the approach and show that nanoparticle patterns that would take hours to build interactively can now be built in minutes. Automatic operation makes possible the construction by manipulation of nanostructures much more complex than those built in the past.","authors":["Aristides A. G.
