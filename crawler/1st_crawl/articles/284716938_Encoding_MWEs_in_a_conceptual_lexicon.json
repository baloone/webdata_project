{"id":"284716938_Encoding_MWEs_in_a_conceptual_lexicon","abstract":"The proposed paper reports on work in progress aimed at the development of a conceptual lexicon of Modern Greek (MG) and the encoding of MWEs in it. Morphosyntactic and semantic properties of these expressions were specified formally and encoded in the lexicon. The resulting resource will be applicable for a number of NLP applications.","authors":["Angeliki/Aggeliki Fotopoulou","Stella Markantonatou","Voula Giouli"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.1.4086.9208","Conference: 10th EACL Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2014)At: Gothenburg, Sweden","Project: Project_Conceptual_lexicon_EKFRASIS_POLYTROPO"],"references":["263388008_Interpretation_of_idiomatic_expressions_by_Greek_speaking_children_Implications_for_the_linguistic_and_psycholinguistic_research_-_An_interdisciplinary_approach","248904594_Les_notions_linguistiques_de_figement_et_de_contrainte","240131679_Multiword_Units_in_Syntactic_Parsing","332862848_The_contemporary_theory_of_metaphor","324371655_Rules_and_Representations","301325905_Idiom_meanings_and_allusional_content","271124716_Une_classification_des_phrases_figees_du_francais","250284636_Sur_les_phrases_figees_complexes_du_francais","242610165_Du_bon_usage_des_expressions_idiomatiques_dans_l'argumentation_en_syntaxe_generative","238258346_Les_limites_de_la_phrase_figee"]}
