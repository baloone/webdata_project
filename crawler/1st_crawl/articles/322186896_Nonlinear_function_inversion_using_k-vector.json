{"id":"322186896_Nonlinear_function_inversion_using_k-vector","abstract":"This work introduces a general numerical technique to invert one dimensional analytic or tabulated nonlinear functions in assigned ranges of interest. The proposed approach is based on an “optimal” version of the k-vector range searching, an ad-hoc modification devised for function inversion. The optimality consists of retrieving always the same number of data (1,2,⋯) for a specified searching range to initiate the root solver. This provides flexibility to adapt the technique to a variety of root solvers (e.g., bisection, Newton, etc.), using a specified number of starting points. The proposed method allows to build an inverse function toolbox for a set of specified nonlinear functions. In particular, the method is suitable when intensive inversions of the same function are required. The inversion is extremely fast (almost instantaneous), but it requires a one-time preprocessing effort.","authors":["David Arnas","Daniele Mortari"],"meta":["March 2018Applied Mathematics and Computation 320:754-768","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2017.10.009"],"references":["339460598_Random_number_generation_using_k-vector","272132970_Theoretical_study_of_contact-mode_triboelectric_nanogenerators_as_an_effective_power_source","260967632_Solving_Kepler's_equation_using_implicit_functions","254199748_Lost-in-Space_Pyramid_Algorithm_for_Robust_Star_Pattern_Recognition","254199734_Search-Less_Algorithm_for_Star_Pattern_Recognition","254199673_A_Fast_On-Board_Autonomous_Attitude_Determination_System_Based_ona_New_Star-ID_Technique_for_a_Wide_FOV_Star_Tracker","283278242_A_k-Vector_Approach_to_Sampling_Interpolation_and_Approximation","268242338_Computation_of_Fresnel_Integrals","243491665_Classical_Electrodynamics","242926815_A_new_family_of_higher_order_methods_for_solving_equations"]}
