{"id":"351374809_A_Modified_Adaptive_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Multi-product_Multi-period_Inventory_Routing_Problem","abstract":"Recent developments in urbanization and e-commerce have pushed businesses to deploy efficient\nsystems to decrease their supply chain cost. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is one of the most\nwidely used strategies to effectively manage supply chains with multiple parties. VMI implementation\nasks for solving the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP). This study considers a multi-product multiperiod inventory routing problem, including a supplier, set of customers, and a fleet of heterogeneous\nvehicles. Due to the complex nature of the IRP, we developed a Modified Adaptive Genetic Algorithm\n(MAGA) to solve a variety of instances efficiently. As a benchmark, we considered the results obtained\nby Cplex software and an efficient heuristic from the literature. Through extensive computational\nexperiments on a set of randomly generated instances, and using different metrics, we show that our\napproach distinctly outperforms the other two methods.","authors":["Meysam Mahjoob","Seyed Sajjad Fazeli","Soodabeh Milanlouei","Leyla Sadat Tavassoli"],"meta":["January 2022","DOI:10.1016/j.susoc.2021.08.002"],"references":["347777604_Integrated_Preventive_Maintenance_Scheduling_Model_with_Redundancy_for_Cutting_Tools_on_a_Single_Machine","309389858_An_Evolutionary_Computation_Approach_to_Solving_Repairable_Multi-State_Multi-Objective_Redundancy_Allocation_Problems","353541400_Green_Supply_Chain_Network_Design_with_Emphasis_on_Inventory_Decisions","345598549_An_Augmented_Tabu_Search_Algorithm_for_the_Green_Inventory-Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","339805888_Heuristic_Sequence_Selection_for_Inventory_Routing_Problem","339731840_A_Matheuristic_Algorithm_for_the_Inventory_Routing_Problem","337701994_An_Exact_Approach_for_Cyclic_Inbound_Inventory_Routing_in_a_Level_Production_System","314793359_Sustainable_maritime_inventory_routing_problem_with_time_window_constraints","311865066_A_Genetic_Algorithm-Taguchi_Based_Approach_to_Inventory_Routing_Problem_of_a_Single_Perishable_Product_with_Transshipment","289522946_A_decomposition-based_heuristic_for_the_multiple-product_inventory-routing_problem"]}
