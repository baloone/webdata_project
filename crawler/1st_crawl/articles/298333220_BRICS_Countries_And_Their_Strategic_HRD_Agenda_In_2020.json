{"id":"298333220_BRICS_Countries_And_Their_Strategic_HRD_Agenda_In_2020","abstract":"This paper will discuss HRDs future in BRICS countries, focusing on an 11-point agenda specially designed for them. These nations are building a consortium to tackle HRD issues and enhance their quality of life by addressing issues such as health, safety, inadequate income, widespread hunger, gender inequality, environmental degradation, virulent diseases, and lack of technological expertise. They intend to promote BRICS and build global partnerships for long-term development and sustainability. This paper will also discuss BRICS strategic HRD practices that are rapidly achieving their objectives. The BRICS have been investing in knowledge-based projects for many years as they believe that growth requires a knowledge economy. This paper will focus on the BRICS nurturing of intellectual capital and evaluates the trend in BRICS HRD practices as they follow their knowledge-based 11-point agenda.","authors":["Nadir Ali Kolachi","Haider Ali Shah"],"meta":["March 2013International Journal of Management & Information Systems (IJMIS) 17(2):105","DOI:10.19030/ijmis.v17i2.7714"],"references":[]}
