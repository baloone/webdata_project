{"id":"348770910_A_semi-explicit_integration_scheme_for_weakly-coupled_poroelasticity_with_nonlinear_permeability","abstract":"Within the time integration of linear elliptic‐parabolic problems such as poroelasticity, large systems have to be solved in every time step. With a semi‐explicit approach, these systems decouple, leading to a remarkable speed‐up. This paper indicates that this idea can also be applied to nonlinear problems such as poroelasticity with nonlinear permeability. To see this, we consider a related toy problem.","authors":["Robert Altmann","Roland Maier","Benjamin Unger"],"meta":["January 2021PAMM 20(1)","DOI:10.1002/pamm.202000061"],"references":["322221096_Computational_Multiscale_Methods_for_Linear_Heterogeneous_Poroelasticity","262602146_Analysis_and_numerical_approximations_of_equations_of_nonlinear_poroelasicity","346305807_Semi-explicit_discretization_schemes_for_weakly_coupled_elliptic-parabolic_problems","224558403_General_Theory_of_Three-Dimensional_Consolidation"]}
