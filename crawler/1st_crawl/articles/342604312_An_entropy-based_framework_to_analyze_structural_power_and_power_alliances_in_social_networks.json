{"id":"342604312_An_entropy-based_framework_to_analyze_structural_power_and_power_alliances_in_social_networks","abstract":"power is a central phenomenon in societies. So for ages, numerous power perceptions in philosophy and sociology have existed. Measuring power of an actor in its social fabric is a difficult issue, however. After sketching first attempts for this in social network analyses, we develop a new power theory. To this end, we distinguish between vertices in the network and actors acting in vertices. Vertices get structural power potential from their position in the net. in an entropy-driven model such potential can be calculated for all vertices; for selected networks, the method is exemplified. Actors in vertices can deploy power potential once they have respective personal skills, and dominate actors in adjacent vertices. if chosen with suitable care, an alliance of actors can even dominate the whole network. the findings are applied to the famous 9/11-network with 34 vertices and 93 edges.","authors":["Andreas Dellnitz","Wilhelm RÃ¶dder"],"meta":["July 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-67542-0","Project: ESNA: Entropy-based Social Network Analysis"],"references":["345773798_Marsilius_von_Padua_und_der_Romzug_Ludwigs_des_Bayern_Politische_Theorie_und_politisches_Handeln","338746674_Social_Network_Analysis","321526721_Geschichte_des_politischen_Denkens","317646360_Structural_Models_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Directed_Graphs","315498836_Einfuhrung_in_die_Netzwerkanalyse","314303441_Compressing_strongly_connected_subgroups_in_social_networks_An_entropy-based_approach","291294945_Who_shall_survive_A_new_approach_to_the_problem_of_human_interrelations","283335057_A_theory_on_power_in_networks","265699204_Informationstheorie_Eine_Einfuhrung_Deutsche_Ubersetzung_von_A_Zassenhaus","264349959_Entropy_based_evaluation_of_net_structures_-_Deployed_in_Social_Network_Analysis"]}
