{"id":"268077225_Counting_Solutions_of_Quadratic_Congruences_in_Several_Variables_Revisited","abstract":"Let N_k(n,r,a) denote the number of incongruent solutions of the quadratic congruence a_1x_1^2 + ··· + a_kx_k^2 ≡ n (mod r), where a = (a_1, ... ,a)k) ∈ Z^k, n ∈ Z, r ∈ N. We give short direct proofs for certain less known compact formulas on N_k(n,r,a), valid for r odd, which go back to the work of Minkowski, Bachmann and Cohen. We also deduce some other related identities and asymptotic formulas which do not seem to appear in the literature.","authors":["László Tóth"],"meta":["November 2014Journal of Integer Sequences 2014(11):Article 14.11.6"],"references":["319865632_The_number_of_k-free_divisors_of_an_integer","274075955_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Numbers","268637326_History_of_the_theory_of_numbers_I_II_III","265587112_Quadratic_Congruences_with_an_Odd_Number_of_Summands","265586935_Representation_of_Integers_as_Sums_of_Squares","264955099_A_classical_introduction_to_modern_number_theory_Rev_and_expand_version_of_1972","263135802_The_Equation_x_2_my_2_k_in_ZpZ","258239817_Elementary_Methods_in_Number_Theory","253690993_Roots_of_unity_and_nullity_modulo_n","248663640_Die_Arithmetik_der_Quadratischen_Formen"]}
