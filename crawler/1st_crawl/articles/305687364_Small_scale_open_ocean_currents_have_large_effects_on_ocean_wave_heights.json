{"id":"305687364_Small_scale_open_ocean_currents_have_large_effects_on_ocean_wave_heights","abstract":"Tidal currents and large oceanic currents, such as the Agulhas, Gulf Stream and Kuroshio, are known to modify ocean wave properties, causing extreme sea states that are a hazard to navigation. Recent advances in the understanding and modeling capability of ocean currents at subme-soscales have revealed the ubiquitous presence of fronts and filaments. Based on realistic numerical models, we show that \nthese structures can be the main source of variability in significant wave heights at scales less than 200 km, including important variations down to 10 km. Model results are consistent with wave height variations along satellite altimeter tracks, resolved at scales larger than 50 km. The spectrum of significant wave heights is found to be roughly proportional to Hs 2 /(g 2 Tm0,−1 2) times the current spectrum, where Hs is the spatially-averaged significant wave height, Tm0,−1 is the average energy period, and g is the gravity acceleration. This variability induced by currents has been largely overlooked in spite of its relevance for extreme wave heights and remote sensing.","authors":["Fabrice Ardhuin","Sarah Gille","Dimitris Menemenlis","Cesar Barbedo Rocha"],"meta":["April 2017Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans , Revised(6)","DOI:10.1002/2016JC012413"],"references":["312068477_Observations_of_Surface-Wave-Current_Interaction","307797493_ECCO_version_4_An_integrated_framework_for_non-linear_inverse_modeling_and_global_ocean_state_estimation","304452423_sea_Surface_KInematics_Multiscale_monitoring_full_proposal_for_ESA_Earth_Explorer_9","303532780_Submesoscale_currents_in_the_ocean","301944936_Surface_waves_affect_frontogenesis","287965183_Mesoscale_to_Submesoscale_Wavenumber_Spectra_in_Drake_Passage","283975918_A_simplified_wave_enhancement_criterion_for_moving_extreme_events","313231546_Sun_glitter_imagery_of_surface_waves_2_Waves_Transformation_on_Ocean_Currents","313199947_Mesoscale_to_submesoscale_transition_in_the_California_current_system_flow_structure_eddy_flux_and_observational_tests","309773332_Winds_and_currents_mission_Ability_to_observe_mesoscale_AIRSEA_coupling"]}
