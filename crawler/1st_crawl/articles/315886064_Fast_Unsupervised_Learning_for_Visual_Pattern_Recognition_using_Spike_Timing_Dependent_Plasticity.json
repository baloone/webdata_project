{"id":"315886064_Fast_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Visual_Pattern_Recognition_using_Spike_Timing_Dependent_Plasticity","abstract":"Real-time learning needs algorithms operating in a fast speed comparable to human or animal, however this is a huge challenge in processing visual inputs. Research shows a biological brain can process complicated real-life recognition scenarios at milliseconds scale. Inspired by biological system, in this paper, we proposed a novel real-time learning method by combing the spike timing-based feed-forward spiking neural network (SNN) and the fast unsupervised spike timing dependent plasticity learning method with dynamic post-synaptic thresholds. Fast cross-validated experiments using MNIST database showed the high efficiency of the proposed method at an acceptable accuracy.","authors":["Daqi Liu","Shigang Yue"],"meta":["April 2017Neurocomputing 249","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2017.04.003"],"references":["261567367_A_Spiking_Self-Organizing_Map_Combining_STDP_Oscillations_and_Continuous_Learning","260662646_Redundant_Neural_Vision_Systems-Competing_for_Collision_Recognition_Roles","254058894_Data-Driven_Cluster_Reinforcement_and_Visualization_in_Sparsely-Matched_Self-Organizing_Maps","247621744_Spike_arrival_times_A_highly_efficient_coding_scheme_for_neural_networks","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","224177605_SWAT_A_Spiking_Neural_Network_Training_Algorithm_for_Classification_Problems","222458686_SpikeNET_A_simulator_for_modeling_large_networks_of_integrate_and_fire_neurons","222405567_Sustained_activity_with_low_firing_rate_in_a_recurrent_network_regulated_by_spike-timing-dependent_plasticity","222394923_Networks_of_integrate-and-fire_neurons_using_Rank_Order_Coding_B_Spike_timing_dependent_plasticity_and_emergence_of_orientation_selectivity","215991023_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI","28352918_Effects_of_Synaptic_Noise_and_Filtering_on_the_Frequency_Response_of_Spiking_Neurons","14567385_Speed_of_Processing_in_the_Human_Visual_System","14422551_A_neuronal_learning_rule_for_sub-millisecond_temporal_coding","14339904_Neural_network_based_on_the_input_organization_of_an_identified_neuron_signaling_impending_collision","14223142_Regulation_of_Synaptic_Efficacy_by_Coincidence_of_Postsynaptic_APs_and_EPSPs","12677428_Modeling_Synaptic_Plasticity_in_Conjunction_with_the_Timing_of_Pre-_and_Postsynaptic_Action_Potentials","12224539_Stable_Hebbian_Learning_from_Spike_Timing-Dependent_Plasticity","11686300_Face_identification_using_one_spike_per_neuron_Resistance_to_image_degradations","11395422_Population_Coding_and_Decoding_in_a_Neural_Field_A_Computational_Study","8106062_Calcium_Time_Course_as_a_Signal_for_Spike-Timing-Dependent_Plasticity","7908150_Neurons_Tune_to_the_Earliest_Spikes_Through_STDP","7060918_Collision_detection_in_complex_dynamic_scenes_using_an_LGMD-based_visual_neural_network_with_feature_enhancement","6500972_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Visual_Features_through_Spike_Timing_Dependent_Plasticity","309602489_A_Rotational_Motion_Perception_Neural_Network_Based_on_Asymmetric_Spatiotemporal_Visual_Information_Processing","270995002_Triplet-based_spike_timing_dependent_plasticity_TSTDP_modeling_using_VHDL-AMS","266263608_Robust_Exemplar_Extraction_Using_Structured_Sparse_Coding","260354085_Rapid_Feedforward_Computation_by_Temporal_Encoding_and_Learning_With_Spiking_Neurons","222520137_Temporal_Pattern_identification_using_Spike-Timing_Dependent_Plasticity","220279756_Visualized_Analysis_of_Mixed_Numeric_and_Categorical_Data_Via_Extended_Self-Organizing_Map","15387355_Noise_neural_codes_and_cortical_organization_Curr_Opin_Neurobiol_4569-579","12677413_Population_Dynamics_of_Spiking_Neurons_Fast_Transients_Asynchronous_States_and_Locking","7877386_Neuronal_variability_Noise_or_part_of_the_signal","7493293_Temporal_codes_and_sparse_representations_A_key_to_understanding_rapid_processing_in_the_visual_system","5960522_Learning_Real-World_Stimuli_in_a_Neural_Network_with_Spike-Driven_Synaptic_Dynamics","5608646_Unsupervised_clustering_with_spiking_neurons_by_sparse_temporal_coding_and_multilayer_RBF_networks","5600780_Self-organization_of_spiking_neurons_using_action_potential_timing"]}
