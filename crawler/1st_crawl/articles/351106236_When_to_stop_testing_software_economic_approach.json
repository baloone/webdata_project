{"id":"351106236_When_to_stop_testing_software_economic_approach","abstract":"When should we stop testing software and release it? Many software engineering papers attempt to answer this question—from the computer science viewpoint. However, the ultimate objective of every company—and software companies are not an exception—is to bring profit. In view of this fact, in this paper, we analyze the problem of when to stop testing from the economic viewpoint. For the simplified first-approximation model, we provide an explicit answer, and we describe how this answer can be made more accurate by using more adequate models.","authors":["Nguyen Ngoc Thach","Francisco Zapata","Olga Kosheleva"],"meta":["June 2021Soft Computing 25(12):1-5","DOI:10.1007/s00500-021-05818-x"],"references":["2364693_Interval_Approach_To_Testing_Software","328870422_Parametric_and_non_parametric_statistical_procedures_Third_edition","274869757_Handbook_of_Parametric_and_Nonparametric_Statistical_Procedures","243720477_Applications_of_Continuous_Mathematics_to_Computer_Science"]}
