{"id":"337427855_Blockchain-based_electronic_healthcare_record_system_for_healthcare_40_applications","abstract":"Modern healthcare systems are characterized as being highly complex and costly. However, this can be reduced through improved health record management, utilization of insurance agencies, and blockchain technology. Blockchain was first introduced to provide distributed records of money-related exchanges that were not dependent on centralized authorities or financial institutions. Breakthroughs in blockchain technology have led to improved transactions involving medical records, insurance billing, and smart con- tracts, enabling permanent access to and security of data, as well as providing a distributed database of transactions. One significant advantage of using blockchain technology in the healthcare industry is that it can reform the interoperability of healthcare databases, providing increased access to patient medical records, device tracking, prescription databases, and hospital assets, including the complete life cycle of a device within the blockchain infrastructure. Access to patientsâ€™ medical histories is essential to cor- rectly prescribe medication, with blockchain being able to dramatically enhance the healthcare services framework. In this paper, several solutions for improving current limitations in healthcare systems using blockchain technology are explored, including frameworks and tools to measure the performance of such systems, e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Composer, Docker Container, Hyperledger Caliper, and the Wireshark capture engine. Further, this paper proposes an Access Control Policy Algorithm for improving data ac- cessibility between healthcare providers, assisting in the simulation of environments to implement the Hyperledger-based eletronic healthcare record (EHR) sharing system that uses the concept of a chain- code. Performance metrics in blockchain networks, such as latency, throughput, Round Trip Time (RTT). have also been optimized for achieving enhanced results. Compared to traditional EHR systems, which use client-server architecture, the proposed system uses blockchain for improving efficiency and security.","authors":["Sudeep Tanwar","Karan Parekh","Richard Evans"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of Information Security and Applications 50(10):102407","DOI:10.1016/j.jisa.2019.102407"],"references":["334966301_A_blockchain-based_architecture_for_securing_electronic_health_record_systems","331476217_BHEEM_A_Blockchain-based_Framework_for_Securing_Electronic_Health_Records","330498481_Blockchain_based_searchable_encryption_for_electronic_health_record_sharing","327361963_Performance_Benchmarking_and_Optimizing_Hyperledger_Fabric_Blockchain_Platform","327111843_Ensuring_Privacy_and_Security_in_E-_Health_Records","327111838_Blind_Signatures_Based_Secured_E-Healthcare_System","326210212_Secure_Cloud-Based_EHR_System_Using_Attribute-Based_Cryptosystem_and_Blockchain","326043995_Blockchain-Based_Data_Preservation_System_for_Medical_Data","325906558_MedBlock_Efficient_and_Secure_Medical_Data_Sharing_Via_Blockchain","325748670_Continuous_Patient_Monitoring_With_a_Patient_Centric_Agent_A_Block_Architecture","324728250_BlocHIE_a_BLOCkchain-based_platform_for_Healthcare_Information_Exchange","320649195_Performance_Modeling_of_PBFT_Consensus_Process_for_Permissioned_Blockchain_Network_Hyperledger_Fabric","320337312_Integrating_Blockchain_for_Data_Sharing_and_Collaboration_in_Mobile_Healthcare_Applications","318666875_MeDShare_Trust-less_Medical_Data_Sharing_Among_Cloud_Service_Providers_Via_Blockchain","311972951_A_Secure_System_For_Pervasive_Social_Network-Based_Healthcare","307156712_Healthcare_Data_Gateways_Found_Healthcare_Intelligence_on_Blockchain_with_Novel_Privacy_Risk_Control","335927651_Blockchain_for_5G-Enabled_IoT_for_Industrial_Automation_A_Systematic_Review_Solutions_and_Challenges","335517902_MudraChain_Blockchain-Based_Framework_for_Automated_Cheque_Clearance_in_Financial_Institutions","334168202_FastFabric_Scaling_Hyperledger_Fabric_to_20000_Transactions_per_Second","332564819_Securing_Electronics_Healthcare_Records_in_Healthcare_40_A_Biometric-based_Approach","329987446_Fog_data_analytics_A_taxonomy_and_process_model","329952216_A_Design_of_Blockchain-Based_Architecture_for_the_Security_of_Electronic_Health_Record_EHR_Systems","328246214_A_Decentralizing_Attribute-Based_Signature_for_Healthcare_Blockchain","327537015_Fog_computing_for_Healthcare_40_environment_Opportunities_and_challenges","326816706_Blockchain_Support_for_Flexible_Queries_with_Granular_Access_Control_to_Electronic_Medical_Records_EMR","322902502_Secure_Attribute-Based_Signature_Scheme_With_Multiple_Authorities_for_Blockchain_in_Electronic_Health_Records_Systems","322408419_Introducing_blockchains_for_healthcare","321657688_Towards_using_blockchain_technology_for_eHealth_data_access_management","318476193_On_the_Design_of_a_Blockchain_Platform_for_Clinical_Trial_and_Precision_Medicine"]}
