{"id":"322198309_Applying_Flipped_Classroom_Methodology_in_Computer_Science_Courses","abstract":"The \"Flipped Classroom\" provides students the opportunity to review material and take notes before class time, but must be coupled with quizzes to assess the student's understanding and review of student notebooks to ensure material is actually reviewed before class. This methodology allows the instructor and students concentrate entirely on the in-class activities, such as reviews of case studies, lab exercises, and mini project developments. The authors share their experience of motivating and stimulating the students to earn benefits from this approach.","authors":["Vladimir Riabov","John J.
