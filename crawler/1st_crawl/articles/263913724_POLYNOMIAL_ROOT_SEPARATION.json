{"id":"263913724_POLYNOMIAL_ROOT_SEPARATION","abstract":"We discuss the following question: How close to each other can two distinct roots of an integer polynomial be? We summarize what is presently known on this and related problems, and establish several new results on root separation of monic, integer polynomials.","authors":["Yannbugeaud","Mauricemignotte"],"meta":["November 2011International Journal of Number Theory 06(03)","DOI:10.1142/S1793042110003083"],"references":["2114432_Distances_between_the_conjugates_of_an_algebraic_number","2099848_Finiteness_Results_for_Hilbert's_Irreducibility_Theorem","346670950_Approximation_by_Algebraic_Numbers","313988237_Classical_Diophantine_Equations","285511618_On_the_difference_x3-y2","285511520_The_Diophantine_equation_x3_-_y2_k","285511328_On_f3t-g2t","266984604_Approximation_by_algebraic_numbers","266730671_On_the_difference_f_3_x-g_2_x","265834048_Distance_entre_les_racines_d'un_polynome","265349424_Some_Useful_Bounds","251630573_Rational_Points_Near_Curves_and_Small_Nonzero_x3-y2_via_Lattice_Reduction","243117359_Mahler's_classification_of_numbers_compared_with_Koksma's_III","243109570_Approximation_mit_algebraischen_Zahlen_beschrankten_Grades","243003631_On_the_global_distance_between_two_algebraic_points_on_a_curve","239061519_Algorithmic_Number_Theory_Volume_1","231853640_On_the_distance_between_roots_of_integer_polynomials","228558978_On_Davenport's_bound_for_the_degree_of_f3-_g2_and_Riemann's_Existence_Theorem","225313965_Diophantine_equation_x3-y2k_and_Hall's_conjecture","222807464_Polynomial_root_separation_examples","46952782_Classical_Diophantine_Equations","46951409_Diophantine_Approximations_and_Diophantine_Equations"]}
