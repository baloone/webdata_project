{"id":"326617363_Modular_based_flexible_digital_twin_for_factory_design","abstract":"Factory design offers many promising capabilities regarding productivity and floor utilization. To evaluate the design and help the designer to escape design flaws, digital twin is proposed to support factory design. With considering of frequently changing in design phase, a modular approach was proposed to help building flexible digital twin and conducting corresponding changes. By using flexible digital twin, designer can quickly evaluate different designs and find design flaws in an easy way. And consequently time saving can be benefited. A case study of application on real factory is presented to illustrate the advantage.","authors":["Jiapeng Guo","Ning Zhao","Lin Sun","Zhang Saipeng"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing 10(6)","DOI:10.1007/s12652-018-0953-6","Projects: Energy- efficient oriented Scheduling and logistics optimization in steel makingPlant simulation support in digital factory planning projects"],"references":["334113041_From_the_Cyber-Physical_System_to_the_Digital_Twin_the_process_development_for_behaviour_modelling_of_a_Cyber_Guided_Vehicle_in_M2M_logic","323397001_Digital_twin-driven_product_design_framework","322708812_A_simulation-based_approach_for_plant_layout_design_and_production_planning","320025921_Digital_Twin_Shop-Floor_A_New_Shop-Floor_Paradigm_Towards_Smart_Manufacturing","319356723_Generating_Digital_Twin_Models_using_Knowledge_Graphs_for_Industrial_Production_Lines","318694164_New_IT_Driven_Service-Oriented_Smart_Manufacturing_Framework_and_Characteristics","317692001_The_Digital_Twin_Demonstrating_the_Potential_of_Real_Time_Data_Acquisition_in_Production_Systems","341246790_Digital_twin_driven_smart_product_design_framework","322390515_Data_Flow_and_Communication_Framework_Supporting_Digital_Twin_for_Geometry_Assurance","320176112_IIHub_An_Industrial_Internet-of-Things_Hub_Toward_Smart_Manufacturing_Based_on_Cyber-Physical_System"]}
