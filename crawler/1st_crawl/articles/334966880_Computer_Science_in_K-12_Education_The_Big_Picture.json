{"id":"334966880_Computer_Science_in_K-12_Education_The_Big_Picture","abstract":"As topics from computer science are increasingly being taught in K-12 schools, it is valuable for those teaching within new curricula to be aware of the purpose of the various components that students are expected to learn. We explore the main purposes of having computer science in curricula in the first place, and then use examples to show how particular topics that might be regarded by some as esoteric can be related to the bigger picture of what is trying to be achieved. The model used is to relate curriculum content to how it affects people, both those who are learning the subject, and those who will be using digital technologies developed by those who have just learned to develop them. This provides a framework to help teachers to motivate themselves, their students, and other stakeholders to engage with new curriculum content.","authors":["Tim BELL"],"meta":["May 2018OLYMPIADS IN INFORMATICS 12:3-11","DOI:10.15388/ioi.2018.01"],"references":[]}
