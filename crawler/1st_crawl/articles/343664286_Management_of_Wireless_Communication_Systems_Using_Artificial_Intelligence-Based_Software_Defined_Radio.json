{"id":"343664286_Management_of_Wireless_Communication_Systems_Using_Artificial_Intelligence-Based_Software_Defined_Radio","abstract":"The wireless communication system was investigated by novel methods, which produce an optimized data link, especially the software-based methods. Software-Defined Radio (SDR) is a common method for developing and implementing wireless communication protocols. In this paper, SDR and artificial intelligence (AI) are used to design a self-management communication system with variable node locations. Three affected parameters for the wireless signal are considered: channel frequency, bandwidth, and modulation type. On one hand, SDR collects and analyzes the signal components while on the other hand, AI processes the situation in real-time sequence after detecting unwanted data during the monitoring stage. The decision was integrated into the system by AI with respect to the instantaneous data read then passed to the communication nodes to take its correct location. The connectivity ratio and coverage area are optimized nearly double by the proposed method, which means the variable node location, according to the peak time, increases the attached subscriber by a while ratio","authors":["Faiq Ahmed","Adnan Mohsin Abdulazeez","Volkan MÃ¼jdat Tiryaki","Diyar Zeebaree"],"meta":["August 2020International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 14(13):107","DOI:10.3991/ijim.v14i13.14211"],"references":["340718529_DSDV_Extension_to_Enhance_the_Performance_of_Ad_Hoc_Networks_in_High_Diverse-Velocity_Environments","337298159_A_Ray_Tracing_Model_for_Wireless_Communications","327131070_Artificial_Neural_Network_Based_Automatic_Modulation_Classification_over_a_Software_Defined_Radio_Testbed","325625815_Multi-channel_Software_Defined_Radio_Experimental_Evaluation_and_Analysis","324201164_Design_and_Implementation_of_Advanced_Encryption_Standard_Security_Algorithm_using_FPGA","324016033_Radio_Hardware_Virtualization_for_Software-Defined_Wireless_Networks","322859325_SDR-Based_Frequency_Interference_Emulator_in_the_Space-Time_Domain_and_Its_Application","322276943_Combination_of_K-means_clustering_with_Genetic_Algorithm_A_review","340500828_Security_and_Routing_Protocol_for_5G_Wireless_Mobile_Networks","329360059_Gene_Selection_and_Classification_of_Microarray_Data_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network"]}
