{"id":"260399814_On_the_Regularity_of_a_Trust_Region-CG_Algorithm_for_Nonlinear_Ill-posed_Inverse_Problems","abstract":"In this paper we consider the regularity of the trust region-cg algorithm, when it is applied to nonlinear ill-posed iverse problems. The trust region algorithm can be viewed as a regularization method, but it diiers from the traditional regularization method, because no penalty term is need. Thus, the determing of the so-called regular-ization parameter in a standard regularization method is avoided. Theoretical analysis of the trust region-cg method is presented, convergency and regularity of the trust region algorithm are proved, and numerical tests are also given.","authors":["Yan-Fei Wang","Ya-xiang Yuan"],"meta":["July 2002","DOI:10.1142/9789812777461_0052"],"references":["268865480_A_Trust_Region_Method_for_Solving_Distributed_Parameter_Identification_Problems","267471662_Trust_region_algorithms_for_nonlinear_programming","233814596_The_theory_of_Tikhonov_regularization_for_Fredholm_equations_of_the_first_kind","313071117_Combining_Trust_Region_and_Line_Search_Techniques","286784019_Ill-posed_problems","247219853_Practical_Methods_of_Optimization_2nd_Edition_Wiley","238880448_On_the_Landweber_iteration_for_nonlinear_ill-posed_problems","238877988_Newton's_Method_with_a_Model_Trust_Region_Modification","238877269_A_Constrained_Least_Squares_Regularization_Method_for_Nonlinear_III-Posed_Problems","238839619_A_convergence_analysis_of_the_Landweber_iteration_fornonlinear_ill-posed_problems"]}
