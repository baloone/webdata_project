{"id":"264229470_Assessing_Creativity_Specific_to_Engineering_with_the_Revised_Creative_Engineering_Design_Assessment","abstract":"Background\nIn engineering, creativity is vital for innovation. The revised Creative Engineering Design Assessment (CEDA) also assesses Usefulness, unlike existing tools. Purpose (Hypothesis)The primary purpose was to test for convergent validity of the CEDA with other engineering creativity and engineering specific measures. The CEDA was administered with the Purdue Creativity Test (PCT), the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test-Rotations (PSVT-R), and a Systems Test that assessed rollercoaster design functionality. We hypothesized that the CEDA would be moderately related to the PCT and anticipated a slight relationship with the PSVT-R and Systems Test. We also investigated gender differences to follow up on previous research. Design/MscethodParticipants were 259 engineering students (221 males and 38 females) in an introductory engineering design two-course sequence who completed the CEDA and PCT (in a cross sectional design). We analyzed PVST-R scores for Fundamentals of Engineering I and Systems Test scores for Fundamentals of Engineering II. ResultsThe CEDA showed high inter-rater reliability. The CEDA and the PCT were significantly related to each other and the CEDA was modestly related to the PSVT-R, both demonstrating convergent validity. Male and female engineering students did not significantly differ on the CEDA, PCT, PSVT-R or Systems Test. Conclusions\nThe CEDA showed high inter-rater reliability. The CEDA and the PCT were significantly related to each other and the CEDA was modestly related to the PSVT-R, both demonstrating convergent validity. Male and female engineering students did not significantly differ on the CEDA, PCT, PSVT-R or Systems Test.","authors":["Christine Charyton","Richard J. Jagacinski","John A.
