{"id":"347545150_High-Fidelity_High-Scalability_Two-Qubit_Gate_Scheme_for_Superconducting_Qubits","abstract":"High-quality two-qubit gate operations are crucial for scalable quantum information processing. Often, the gate fidelity is compromised when the system becomes more integrated. Therefore, a low-error-rate, easy-to-scale two-qubit gate scheme is highly desirable. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new two-qubit gate scheme that exploits fixed-frequency qubits and a tunable coupler in a superconducting quantum circuit. The scheme requires less control lines, reduces cross talk effect, and simplifies calibration procedures, yet produces a controlled-Z gate in 30 ns with a high fidelity of 99.5%, derived from the interleaved randomized benchmarking method. Error analysis shows that gate errors are mostly coherence limited. Our demonstration paves the way for large-scale implementation of high-fidelity quantum operations.","authors":["Yuan Xu","Ji Chu","Jiahao Yuan","Jiawei Qiu"],"meta":["December 2020Physical Review Letters 125(24)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.240503"],"references":["344979894_Demonstrating_a_Continuous_Set_of_Two-Qubit_Gates_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Algorithms","344859590_Improved_Success_Probability_with_Greater_Circuit_Depth_for_the_Quantum_Approximate_Optimization_Algorithm","343872566_Tunable_Coupler_for_Realizing_a_Controlled-Phase_Gate_with_Dynamically_Decoupled_Regime_in_a_Superconducting_Circuit","337627172_Benchmarking_an_11-qubit_quantum_computer","336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","336343721_Realisation_of_high-fidelity_nonadiabatic_CZ_gates_with_superconducting_qubits","335071922_Generation_and_manipulation_of_Schrodinger_cat_states_in_Rydberg_atom_arrays","334527162_A_two-qubit_gate_between_phosphorus_donor_electrons_in_silicon","332825751_Strongly_correlated_quantum_walks_with_a_12-qubit_superconducting_processor","324055328_Tunable_Coupling_Scheme_for_Implementing_High-Fidelity_Two-Qubit_Gates","322243414_Quantum_Computing_in_the_NISQ_era_and_beyond","317711597_Parametrically-Activated_Entangling_Gates_Using_Transmon_Qubits","261837868_Superconducting_quantum_circuits_at_the_surface_code_threshold_for_fault_tolerance","260481583_Optimal_Quantum_Control_Using_Randomized_Benchmarking","260440241_Qubit_Architecture_with_High_Coherence_and_Fast_Tunable_Coupling","260340006_Fast_adiabatic_qubit_gates_using_only_z_control","255787388_Investigating_the_limits_of_randomized_benchmarking_protocols","230609289_Surface_codes_Towards_practical_large-scale_quantum_computation","221719867_Efficient_Measurement_of_Quantum_Gate_Error_by_Interleaved_Randomized_Benchmarking","51653546_Simple_All-Microwave_Entangling_Gate_for_Fixed-Frequency_Superconducting_Qubits","26325687_Demonstration_of_Two-Qubit_Algorithms_with_a_Superconducting_Quantum_Processor","1861297_Charge_insensitive_qubit_design_derived_from_the_Cooper_pair_box","347540183_Implementation_of_Conditional_Phase_Gates_Based_on_Tunable_Z_Z_Interactions","343869327_Error_analysis_in_suppression_of_unwanted_qubit_interactions_for_a_parametric_gate_in_a_tunable_superconducting_circuit","337372819_Diabatic_Gates_for_Frequency-Tunable_Superconducting_Qubits","337182808_Suppression_of_Qubit_Crosstalk_in_a_Tunable_Coupling_Superconducting_Circuit","335901461_Fast_High-Fidelity_Conditional-Phase_Gate_Exploiting_Leakage_Interference_in_Weakly_Anharmonic_Superconducting_Qubits","335072053_Generation_of_multicomponent_atomic_Schrodinger_cat_states_of_up_to_20_qubits","321660516_Resonantly_driven_CNOT_gate_for_electron_spins","311430113_Efficient_Z-Gates_for_Quantum_Computing","301879305_Universal_Gate_for_Fixed-Frequency_Qubits_via_a_Tunable_Bus","282814290_Qubit_Metrology_of_Ultralow_Phase_Noise_Using_Randomized_Benchmarking","256466418_Coherent_Josephson_Qubit_Suitable_for_Scalable_Quantum_Integrated_Circuits","51185722_Scalable_and_Robust_Randomized_Benchmarking_of_Quantum_Processes","1897552_Randomized_Benchmarking_of_Quantum_Gates"]}
