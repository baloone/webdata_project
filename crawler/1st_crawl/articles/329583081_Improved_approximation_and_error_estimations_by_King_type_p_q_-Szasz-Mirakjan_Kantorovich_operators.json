{"id":"329583081_Improved_approximation_and_error_estimations_by_King_type_p_q_-Szasz-Mirakjan_Kantorovich_operators","abstract":"In the present paper, two different modifications are proposed for (p , q)-Szász-Mirakjan-Kantorovich operators which preserve some test functions. Some approximation results with the help of better-known Korovkin's theorem and weighted Korovkin's theorem for these operators are presented. Furthermore, convergence properties in terms of modulus of continuity and class of Lipschitz functions are studied. It has been shown that for a given absolute error bound, King type modified (p , q)-Szász-Mirakjan-Kantorovich operators require lesser value of m and elapsed time within some subintervals. Further for comparisons , some graphics and error estimation tables are presented using MATLAB(R2018a).","authors":["Mohammad Mursaleen","Ambreen Naaz","Asif Khan"],"meta":["December 2018Applied Mathematics and Computation 348(C):175-185","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2018.11.044"],"references":[]}
