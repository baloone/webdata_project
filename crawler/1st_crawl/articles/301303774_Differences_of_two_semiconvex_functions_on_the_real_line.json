{"id":"301303774_Differences_of_two_semiconvex_functions_on_the_real_line","abstract":"It is proved that real functions on R which can be represented as the difference of two semiconvex functions with a general modulus (or of two lower C1-functions, or of two strongly paraconvex functions) coincide with semismooth functions on R (i.e. those locally Lipschitz functions on R for which f'+(x) = limt→x+ f'+(t) and f'-(x) = limt→x- f'-(t) for each x). Further, for each modulus ω, we characterize the class DSCω of functions on R which can be written as f = g - h, where g and h are semiconvex with modulus Cω (for some C > 0) using a new notion of [ω]-variation. We prove that f ∈ DSCω if and only if f is continuous and there exists D > 0 such that f'+ has locally finite [Dω]-variation. This result is proved via a generalization of the classical Jordan decomposition theorem which characterizes the differences of two ω-ondecreasing functions (defined by the inequality f(y) ≥ f(x) - ω(y - x) for y > x) on [a, b] as functions with finite [2ω]-variation. The research was motivated by a recent article by J. Duda and L. Zajíček on Gâteaux differentiability of semiconvex functions, in which surfaces described by differences of two semiconvex functions naturally appear.","authors":["Václav Kryštof","Zajíček Luděk"],"meta":["April 2016Commentationes Mathematicae Universitatis Carolinae 57(1):21-37","DOI:10.14712/1213-7243.2015.153"],"references":["243058794_The_Structure_of_Regulated_Functions"]}
