{"id":"254894817_Learning_Path_Specification","abstract":"Flexible lifelong learning requires that learners can compare and select learning paths that best meet individual needs, not just in terms of learning goals, but also in terms of planning, costs etc. To this end a learning path specification was developed, which describes both the contents and the structure of any learning path, be it formal, non-formal, informal, or indeed a combination of these. This paper briefly explains the learning path specification and presents a framework for the evaluation of the specification based on theories of model quality. A study of learner choice processes (n=15) was carried out to investigate the specification's semantic and pragmatic quality (clarity, completeness and parsimony) with respect to the selection of a learning path. Results indicate that the specification does not contain any redundant information. Instead, the study has led to improvement of the specification's (feasible) completeness by further refinement of scheduling information. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).","authors":["José Janssen","Henry Hermans","Adriana Berlanga","Rob Koper"],"meta":["July 2011Educational Technology & Society 14(3)"],"references":["234782046_Integrating_the_understanding_of_quality_in_requirements_specification_and_conceptual_modeling","220497468_Personal_recommender_systems_for_learners_in_lifelong_learning_networks_The_requirements_techniques_and_model","48909675_Escaping_the_tyranny_of_choice_When_fewer_attributes_make_choice_easier","44823847_Recognition_of_Informal_Learning_Challenges_and_Issues","252816455_Learning_Network_Services_for_Professional_Development","234045697_Towards_a_learning_path_specification","228253834_Learning_Conditions_at_Work_A_Framework_to_Understand_and_Assess_Informal_Learning_in_the_Workplace","228009028_Validation_of_Formal_Non-Formal_and_Informal_Learning_Policy_and_Practices_in_EU_Member_States","227183232_How_to_Find_and_Follow_Suitable_Learning_Paths","220351098_Quality_in_conceptual_modeling_Five_examples_of_the_state_of_the_art"]}
