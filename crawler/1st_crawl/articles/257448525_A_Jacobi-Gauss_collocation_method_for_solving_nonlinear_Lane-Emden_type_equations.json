{"id":"257448525_A_Jacobi-Gauss_collocation_method_for_solving_nonlinear_Lane-Emden_type_equations","abstract":"In this paper, a shifted Jacobi–Gauss collocation spectral method is proposed for solving the nonlinear Lane–Emden type equation. The spatial approximation is based on shifted Jacobi polynomials PT,n(α,β)(x) with α, β ∈ (−1, ∞), T > 0, and n is the polynomial degree. The shifted Jacobi–Gauss points are used as collocation nodes. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique and a comparison is made with existing results. The method is easy to implement and yields very accurate results.","authors":["A. H.
