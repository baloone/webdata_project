{"id":"266549297_Frames_in_tensor_products_of_Hilbert_C_-modules","abstract":"We introduce a tensor product in the category of Hilbert C * -modules, and we show that, if {x α } and {y β } are frames for Hilbert C * -modules H and K, respectively, then {x α ⊗y β } is a frame for their tensor product H⊗K. We also show that, if they are tight, normalized or standard, then so is {x α ⊗y β }. We get some results for the relation between their frame operators. Also, we show that each frame in H⊗K induces frames for H and K.","authors":["Amir Khosravi","Behrooz Khosravi"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
