{"id":"354744380_On_Some_Plane_Graphs_and_Their_Metric_Dimension","abstract":"Metric basis and metric dimension has become an integral part of molecular topology and combinatorial chemistry. It has a lot of applications in pharmacy, chemistry, computer, and mathematical disciplines. Let \\(\\Phi =(V,E)\\) be a simple connected graph. A subset \\(F=\\{y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3},\\ldots ,y_{s}\\}\\) of distinct vertices from \\(V(\\Phi )\\) is called a resolving set if for any \\(a \\in V(\\Phi )\\), the metric code of a with respect to F that is denoted by \\(\\zeta (a|F)\\), which is defined as \\(\\zeta (a|F)=(d(y_{1},a), d(y_{2},a), d(y_{3}, a),\\ldots , d(y_{s},a))\\), is distinct for distinct a. Then, such a set F with minimum cardinality is called the metric basis for \\(\\Phi \\), and this minimum cardinality of a resolving set F is called the metric dimension of \\(\\Phi \\) and is denoted by \\(dim(\\Phi )\\). A polytope in elementary geometry is a geometric object with flat sides. The polytopes which are convex sets and are contained in the n-dimensional space \\(\\mathbb {R}^{n}\\) (Euclidean space) are termed convex polytopes. Convex polytopes have found a lot of applications in different areas of computer science and mathematics. In this work, we construct two closely related families of convex polytope graphs (viz., \\(\\mathfrak {D}_{n}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak {Q}_{n}\\)), using the existing families of convex polytope graphs. We study the metric dimension for these graphs and prove that only three vertices are a minimum requirement for the unique identification of all vertices in these graphs. We also give some partial answers to the problems raised in the recent past.","authors":["Sunny KUMAR Sharma","Vijay Kumar Bhat"],"meta":["October 2021International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics 7(5)","DOI:10.1007/s40819-021-01141-z"],"references":["353252132_The_Vertex-Edge_Resolvability_of_Some_Wheel-Related_Graphs","352528786_Metric_dimension_and_edge_metric_dimension_of_windmill_graphs","343347695_Computing_the_edge_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes_related_graphs","299948405_On_the_metric_dimension_of_rotationally-symmetric_graphs","296848328_Uniquely_identifying_the_edges_of_a_graph_The_edge_metric_dimension","271010685_Computing_the_metric_dimension_of_wheel_related_graphs","351172637_Fault-Tolerant_Metric_Dimension_of_Two-Fold_Heptagonal-Nonagonal_Circular_Ladder","343043804_Metric_Dimension_of_heptagonal_circular_ladder","324468497_A_Combinatory_Detection_Problem","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","268634014_Families_of_rotationally-symmetric_plane_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","265368560_Families_of_plane_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","264553656_Families_of_regular_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","265451458_A_Combinatory_Detection_Problem","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph"]}
