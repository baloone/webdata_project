{"id":"318946565_Hybrid_Neuro-Fuzzy_System_for_Prediction_of_Lung_Diseases_Based_on_the_Observed_Symptom_Values","abstract":"General lung diseases in humans are asthma, tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer. Among all these lung diseases, the lung cancer is the deadliest one. The purpose of this work is to design an Hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy System (HNFS) for the prediction of lung diseases such as asthma, TB and lung cancer, based on observed symptom values, which could be used in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems to save the life of the patient. To predict lung diseases, Cancer Assessment Questionnaire for Lungs (CAQ-L) was prepared, which consists of questions of symptoms on asthma, tuberculosis and lung cancer. This study was carried out for 221 abnormal (asthma, tuberculosis and cancer) subjects and 50 normal subjects, aged between 37-81 years, asked to respond to the CAQ-L. The significant symptoms were identified based on Pearsonâ€™s correlations performed on all the observed data. Out of 271 subjects, 163 were used to train the system and other 108 were used for testing. The proposed HNFS has achieved a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 100%, 75% and 95%, respectively. The pathological reports and Computed Tomographic (CT) scan reports retrospectively collected from pathologists and radiologists were taken as gold standard to validate the result. The experimental results indicated that the performance of the proposed HNFS was comparable with that of gold standard.","authors":["Manikandan Thiyagarajan"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences"],"references":["316707598_Application_of_Neural_Networks_to_Data_Mining","312494579_Hybrid_neuro-fuzzy_system_for_prediction_of_stages_of_lung_cancer_based_on_the_observed_symptom_values","305441176_A_survey_on_computer-aided_diagnosis_systems_for_lung_cancer_detection","303950120_Lung_Cancer_Detection_Using_Fuzzy_Auto-Seed_Cluster_Means_Morphological_Segmentation_and_SVM_Classifier","286441029_Experimental_Study_and_steady_state_stability_analysis_of_CLL-T_Series_Parallel_Resonant_Converter_with_Fuzzy_controller_using_State_Space_Analysis","280042209_DESIGN_OF_LUNG_CANCER_SPECIFIC_QUESTIONNAIRES_FOR_SOUTH_INDIAN_POPULATION","279971066_Lobar_Fissure_Extraction_in_Isotropic_CT_Lung_Images_-An_Application_to_Cancer_Identification","279870118_A_novel_semi-automated_3-D_CAD_visualization_system_as_an_aid_for_surgical_planning_of_lung_cancer","289318363_Diagnosis_of_diabetic_retinopathy_by_extracting_blood_vessels_and_exudates_using_retinal_color_fundus_images","281314251_Feature_selection_based_on_the_classifier_models_Performance_Issues_in_the_pre-diagnosis_of_Lung_cancer"]}
