{"id":"3113692_Decision_Trees_and_Decision-Making","abstract":"Various practical systems capable of extracting descriptive\ndecision-making knowledge from data have been developed and evaluated.\nTechniques that represent knowledge about classified tasks in the form\nof decision trees are examined. A sample of techniques is sketched,\nranging from basic methods of constructing decision trees to ways of\nusing them noncategorically. Some characteristics that suggest whether a\nparticular classification task is likely to be amenable or not to\ntree-based methods are discussed","authors":["Ross Quinlan"],"meta":["April 1990IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics 20(2):339 - 346","DOI:10.1109/21.52545","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["221112466_ASSISTANT_86_A_Knowledge-Elicitation_Tool_for_Sophisticated_Users","220815609_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Pattern_Recognition_Neural_Nets_and_Machine_Learning_Classification_Methods","220344148_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Selection_Measures_for_Decision-Tree_Induction","32033078_Expert_Systems-Rule_Induction_with_Statistical_Data","313757453_Structuring_knowledge_by_asking_questions","313174312_Experience_in_the_use_of_an_inductive_system_in_knowledge_engineering","300934372_TWO_ALGORITHMS_THAT_LEARN_DNF_BY_DISCOVERING_RELEVANT_FEATURESAn_extended_version_of_this_paper_is_presented_in_8","289892826_An_Overview_of_Machine_Learning","288987576_Learning_Efficient_Classification_Procedures_and_Their_Application_to_Chess_End_Games","268838460_Decision_trees_and_multi-valued_attributes","267701374_I_BULLETBULLET_A_Comparative_Study_of_Inductive_Learning_Systems_AQllP_and_ID-3_Using_a_Chess_Endgame_Test_Problem","262349823_Probabilistic_decision_trees","262217672_Artificial_intelligence_An_introduction","247122070_Pattern_Recognition_as_Rule-Guided_Inference","245473224_Some_studies_in_machine_learning_using_the_game_of_checkers_IIRecent_progress","243765777_Decision_trees_as_probabilistic_classifiers","242609215_Discovering_rules_by_induction_from_large_collections_of_examples","240310918_Classification_and_Regression_Trees_CART","239655109_Improving_the_Design_of_Similarity-Based_Rule-Learning_Systems","235961479_Classification_and_Regression_Trees","235948353_Mozeti_I_Hong_J_and_Lavra_N1986_The_multipurpose_incremental_learning_system_AQ15_and_its_testing_application_to_three_medical_domains","234798948_Comparison_of_ACLS_and_classical_linear_methods_in_a_biological_application","232955275_On_the_connection_between_the_complexity_and_credibility_of_inferred_models","232519711_Experiments_in_Induction","232502159_Concept_Learning_An_Information_Processing_Problem","226523327_Incremental_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","226192677_The_CN2_Induction_algorithm","224377535_Pattern_recognition_as_rule-guided_inductive_inference_IEEE_Trans_PAMI-2_4_349-361","222469208_Simplifying_Decision_Trees","221605731_The_Multi-Purpose_Incremental_Learning_System_AQ15_and_Its_Testing_Application_to_Three_Medical_Domains","221603191_Beyond_Incremental_Processing_Tracking_Concept_Drift","221346239_Unknown_Attribute_Values_in_Induction","221346055_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Genetic_and_Decision-Tree_Classifiers","221345851_Knowledge_Intensive_Induction","221345658_Induction_of_Decision_Trees_from_Inconclusive_Data","221344883_Two_Algorithms_That_Learn_DNF_by_Discovering_Relevant_Features","221112505_Structuring_Knowledge_by_Asking_Questions","220811913_Generating_Rules_from_Examples","220689979_Structured_Induction_in_Expert_Systems","220600211_The_Psychology_of_Computer_Vision","220536535_An_Introduction_to_Knowledge-Based_Expert_Systems","220536270_Concept_development_for_Expert_System_Knowledge_Bases","220343383_A_General_Framework_for_Induction_and_a_Study_of_Selective_Induction","220246597_Inferring_Decision_Trees_Using_the_Minimum_Description_Length_Principle","220111293_Constructing_Optimal_Binary_Decision_Trees_is_NP-Complete","19577607_A_rule-based_process_control_method_with_feedback","19483563_Comparison_of_the_ID3_algorithm_versus_discriminant_analysis_for_performing_feature_selection","3497023_Interactive_induction","3282232_Assessing_Credit_Card_Applications_Using_Machine_Learning"]}
