Zagreb indices are among the most studied topological indices due to their applications in chemistry. In this paper, we compute first and second reverse Zagreb indices, reverse hyper-Zagreb indices and their polynomials of Prophyrin, Propyl ether imine, Zinc Porphyrin and Poly (ethylene amido amine) dendrimers. Keywords: reverse Zagreb index; reverse hyper-Zagreb index; reverse Zagreb polynomials; prophyrin; propyl ether imine; zinc porphyrin and poly (ethylene amido amine)","authors":["Wei Gao","Muhammad Younas","Muhammad Adeel","Abaid Ur Rehman Virk"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.3390/math6100214"],"references":["328070526_M-Polynomials_and_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_the_Crystallographic_Structure_of_Molecules","326904605_On_Eccentricity-Based_Topological_Indices_Study_of_a_Class_of_Porphyrin-Cored_Dendrimers","326833556_Calculating_the_Degree-based_Topological_Indices_of_Dendrimers","326817584_On_the_Multiplicative_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_Silicon-Carbon_Si2C3-Ipq_and_Si2C3-IIpq","325984696_On_Eccentricity-Based_Topological_Indices_and_Polynomials_of_Phosphorus-Containing_Dendrimers","323573697_The_Mechanisms_Kinetics_and_Thermodynamics_of_the_Gas-phase_Pyrolysis_of_sec-butyl_Bromide_A_Computational_Approach","322602720_Reverse_Zagreb_and_Reverse_Hyper-Zagreb_Indices_and_their_Polynomials_of_Rhombus_Silicate_Networks","322465535_Study_of_Dendrimers_by_Topological_Indices","326904772_Three_NewOld_Vertex-Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_Some_Dendrimers_Structure","322097565_Nano_Properties_Analysis_Via_Fourth_Multiplicative_ABC_Indicator_Calculating"]}
