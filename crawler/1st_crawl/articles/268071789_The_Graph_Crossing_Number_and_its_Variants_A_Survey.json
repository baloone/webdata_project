{"id":"268071789_The_Graph_Crossing_Number_and_its_Variants_A_Survey","abstract":"The crossing number is a popular tool in graph drawing and visualization, but there is not really just one crossing number; there is a large family of crossing number notions of which the crossing number is the best known. We survey the rich variety of crossing number variants that have been introduced in the literature for purposes that range from studying the theoretical underpinnings of the crossing number to crossing minimization for visualization problems.","authors":["Marcus Schaefer"],"meta":["April 2013The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 20(2)","DOI:10.37236/2713"],"references":["289099630_The_book_thickness_of_a_graph_II","266496786_Crossing_numbers_of_sequences_of_graphs_I_General_tiles","262237603_New_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Number_of_k-Edges_and_the_Rectilinear_Crossing_Number_of_K_n","260502679_On_Crossing_Minimization_Problem","243780247_Parity_of_numbers_of_crossings_for_complete_n-partite_graphs","329680816_A_lifetime_of_puzzles","293050627_On_the_crossing_number_of_Kmn","288273876_On_the_Number_of_Crossings_in_a_Complete_Graph","287008468_The_crossing_number_of_C6_Cn","285361420_A_combinatorial_problem","284972184_A_note_of_welcome","281043802_A_special_crossing_number_for_bipartite_graphs_A_research_problem","277289557_Convex_Grid_Drawings_Of_3-Connected_Planar_Graphs","271279158_Symmetry_and_the_crossing_number_for_complete_graphs","269002684_Determinants_Permanents_and_Bipartite_Graphs","268850032_On_2-Embeddable_Graphs","268710438_The_circular_k-partite_crossing_number_of_K_mn","268634046_Graph_planarization_and_skewness","266960220_Maximal_Rectilinear_Crossing_of_Cycles","266847362_Symmetry_and_the_crossing_number_of_complete_graphs","265765945_The_Same_Upper_Bound_for_Both_The_2-Page_and_the_Rectilinear_Crossing_Numbers_of_the_n-Cube","265529689_On_the_outerplanar_crossing_numbers_of_K_mn","265444422_The_Complexity_of_Coloring_Circular_Arcs_and_Chords","265442320_Additive_Combinatorics","265312178_The_Rectilinear_Crossing_Number_of_a_Complete_Graph_and_Sylvester's_Four_Point_Problem_of_Geometric_Probability","264365101_The_crossing_number_of_C5_Cn","263980043_PLANAR_CROSSING_NUMBERS_OF_GRAPHS_EMBEDDABLE_IN_ANOTHER_SURFACE","263908444_Convex_Grid_Drawings_of_3-Connected_Planar_Graphs","262329040_Embedding_a_Graph_into_a_d_plus_1-page_Book_with_m_log_d_n_Edge-crossings_over_the_Spine","262324717_A_Fast_and_Simple_Subexponential_Fixed_Parameter_Algorithm_for_One-Sided_Crossing_Minimization","259479012_On_circular_layouts","257428964_On_the_Degenerate_Crossing_Number","257428948_Planar_Crossing_Numbers_of_Graphs_of_Bounded_Genus","257001057_2-pancyclic_graphs","257001014_Generalized_-ary_tanglegrams_on_level_graphs_A_satisfiability-based_approach_and_its_evaluation","256935859_Zarankiewicz's_Conjecture_is_finite_for_each_fixed_m","256720844_Density_of_straight-line_1-planar_graph_drawings","256157489_The_crossing_number_of_the_complement_of_a_circuit","256152546_Computer-generated_multi-row_schematics","255828269_K_-page_crossing_number_minimization_problem_An_evaluation_of_heuristics_and_its_solution_using_GESAKP","255673202_Embedding_Graphs_into_a_Three_Page_Book_with_Om_log_n_Crossings_of_Edges_over_the_Spine","250765660_The_toroidal_crossing_number_of_the_complete_graph","248177798_Two_old_extremal_graph_drawing_conjectures_Progress_and_perspectives","247819350_The_convex_hull_of_every_optimal_pseudolinear_drawing_of_Kn_is_a_triangle","247043450_On_the_NP-completeness_of_a_computer_network_layout_problem","246785696_Maximum_versus_minimum_invariants_for_graphs","244906729_The_crossing_number_of_C3_X_Cn","243788527_The_crossing_number_of_K-4K-n_on_the_real_projective_plane","243775150_A_Method_for_Depicting_Social_Relationships_Obtained_by_Sociometric_Testing","243768990_A_new_crossing_number_for_bipartite_graphs"]}
