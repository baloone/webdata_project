{"id":"288629850_Continuous_Monitoring_of_Adaptive_e-learning_Systems_Requirements","abstract":"E-learning is a promising research area, as they are expected to increase enrollment and improve the quality of education. Adaptive e-learning systems, traditionally focused on content personalization, are in need to cope with continuous changing requirements and changing environment. Indeed, the specification and the management quality attributes of such systems, supported throughout the whole lifecycle are still missing. In this paper, we present an approach for continuous requirements monitoring that uses constraint programming to evaluate the satisfaction of the requirements in adaptive e-learning systems and identify solutions (valid configurations) when deviations occur at runtime. To this end, the requirements are conceptualized as a dynamic software product line. A new requirements engineering tool that supports (dynamic) software product line engineering is used for the specification of the adaptive e-learning systems and its continuous monitoring.","authors":["Dounas Lamiae","Ra√∫l Mazo","Camille Salinesi","Omar El Beqqali"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507210","Conference: 12th ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)At: Marrakech-Morocco"],"references":["317447415_Towards_a_Requirements_Specification_Multi-View_Framework_for_Self-Adaptive_Systems","312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","291941898_Engineering_self-adaptive_systems_through_feedback_loops","282859792_Runtime_Requirements_Monitoring_Framework_for_Adaptive_e-Learning_Systems","280656146_VariaMos_an_Extensible_Tool_for_Engineering_dynamic_Product_Lines","265466879_Towards_a_Requirements_Specification_Multi-View_Framework_for_Self-Adaptive_Systems","259231432_Constraints_The_Heart_of_Domain_and_Application_Engineering_in_the_Product_Lines_Engineering_Strategy","316807209_Autonomic_Computing","313528872_Reconciling_system_requirements_and_runtime_behavior","307791911_AHA_The_adaptive_hypermedia_architecture"]}
