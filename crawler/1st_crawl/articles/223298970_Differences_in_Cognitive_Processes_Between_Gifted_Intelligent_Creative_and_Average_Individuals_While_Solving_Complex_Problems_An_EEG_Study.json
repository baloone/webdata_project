{"id":"223298970_Differences_in_Cognitive_Processes_Between_Gifted_Intelligent_Creative_and_Average_Individuals_While_Solving_Complex_Problems_An_EEG_Study","abstract":"This study investigated the differences in cognitive processes related to creativity and intelligence using EEG coherence and power measures in the lower (α1=7.9–10.0 Hz) and upper alpha band (α2=10.1–12.9 Hz). In two experiments, gifted, creative, intelligent subjects, and individuals of average ability solved closed and open problems while their EEG was recorded. The analysis of EEG measures in Experiment 1 indicated that highly intelligent individuals (HIQ—gifted and intelligent) showed higher alpha power (less mental activity) and more cooperation between brain areas when solving closed problems than did average intelligent individuals (AIQ—creative and average). Much more pronounced were the differences in EEG patterns obtained in Experiment 2. Highly creative individuals (HC—gifted and creative) displayed less mental activity than did average creative individuals (AC—intelligent and average) when engaged in the solution of different creative problems. Creative individuals also showed more cooperation between brain areas than did gifted ones, who showed greater decoupling of brain areas when solving ill-defined problems. The results of both experiments suggest that creativity and intelligence are different abilities that also differ in the neurological activity displayed by individuals while solving open or closed problems. The results further suggest that a selective involvement of cortical zones that are relevant for the solution of a problem could be an explanation for the observed differences in problem solving.","authors":["Norbert Jausovec"],"meta":["September 2000Intelligence 28(3):213-237","DOI:10.1016/S0160-2896(00)00037-4"],"references":["254093960_Differences_in_EEG_Alpha_Activity_Between_Gifted_and_Non-Identified_Individuals_Insights_into_Problem_Solving","247528320_Problem_finding_and_problem_solving_Problem_finding_creativity_and_giftedness","247497286_Musicians_Processing_Music_Measurement_of_Brain_Potentials_with_EEG","21357412_Enhanced_right_hemisphere_activation_in_the_mathematically_precocious_A_preliminary_EEG_investigation","16241953_Left-handedness_Association_with_Immune_Disease_Migraine_and_Developmental_Learning_Disorder","302459916_The_ten-twenty_electrode_system_of_the_international_federation_of_electroencephalography","300986403_Intelligence_and_the_Brain","289963889_Manual_for_Raven's_Progressive_Matrices_and_Vocabulary_Scales","289906277_EEG_Topography_and_Mental_Performance","288440376_Problem-Solving_Ability","286780847_The_Ten-Twenty_Electrode_System_of_the_International_Federation_in_Electroencephalography_and_Clinical_Neurophysiology","284650067_Electrocortical_Indices_of_Hemispheric_Utilization","283454006_Heuristics_and_cognition_in_complex_systems","283062756_Spiel_und_Wirklichkeit_uber_die_Verwendung_und_den_Nutzen_computersimulierter_Planspiele","279341349_Handbook_of_Creativity","262231519_Manual_for_Raven's_Progressive_Matrices_and_Vocabulary_Scales_The_Mill_Hill_Vocabulary_Scale","254302232_Sex_Differences_and_Lateralization_in_Temporal_Lobe_Glucose_Metabolism_During_Mathematical_Reasoning","254301065_Creativity_and_cognition_some_implications_for_arts_education","247807621_What_Can_Heart_Rate_Tell_Us_About_the_Creative_Process","245759164_EEG_und_Denken","245587581_Biological_bases_of_creativity","244804835_EEG_coherence_and_intelligence_in_children","243784303_The_Torrance_Tests_of_Creative_Thinking","240290762_Differences_in_EEG_Activity_During_the_Solution_of_Closed_and_Open_Problems","232853522_Sex_Differences_Hemispheric_Laterality_and_Associated_Brain_Activity_in_the_Intellectually_Gifted","232601672_Problem_Solving_and_Learning","232576005_Modes_of_Thinking_in_Young_Children","232438156_Epilepsy_and_The_Functional_Anatomy_of_The_Human_Brain","231824809_Sex_Differences_in_Mathematical_Reasoning_Ability_in_Intellectually_Talented_Preadolescents_Their_Nature_Effects_and_Possible_Causes","229468968_Editorial_Policy_on_Analyses_of_Variance_With_Repeated_Measures","229059927_GPS_A_Case_Study_in_Generality_and_Problem_Solving","223739368_Cortical_glucose_metabolic_rate_correlates_of_abstract_reasoning_and_attention_studied_with_PET","223694817_Intelligence_and_changes_in_regional_cerebral_glucose_metabolic_rate_following_learning","222974894_Differences_in_EEG_alpha_activity_related_to_giftedness","222754255_Intelligence_and_spatiotemporal_patterns_of_event-related_desynchronization_ERD","222217004_Are_gifted_individuals_less_chaotic_thinkers","222053723_EEG_alpha_asymmetry_and_creativity","220041909_Problem-Solving_And_Learning","200033866_Anatomy_of_the_Cortex_Statistics_and_Geometry","35323299_Electrocortical_indices_of_hemispheric_specialization","31277940_The_Berger_rhythm_Potential_changes_from_the_occipital_lobes_of_man","22361620_EEG_correlates_of_cerebral_dominance","21718367_Dimensional_analysis_of_the_human_EEG_and_intelligence","21556494_Measuring_mental_performance_an_old_idea_and_a_new_approach","20947681_Pretrial_EEG_coherence_as_a_predictor_of_semantic_priming_effects","19947666_EEG_Activity_During_Performance_of_Cognitive_Tasks_Demanding_Verbal_andor_Spatial_Processing","19375596_Physiological_correlates_of_intellectual_precocity","19339282_A_Solution_for_Reliable_and_Valid_Reduction_of_Ocular_Artifacts_Applied_to_the_P300_ERP","17011280_An_electrode_cap_tested","16885994_Models_of_the_brain_organization_for_higher_integrative_functions_derived_with_electrical_stimulation_techniques","15501742_Brain_activation_with_a_maze_test_An_EEG_coherence_analysis_study_in_healthy_subjects","15409491_Electroencephalographic_coherences_discriminate_between_children_with_different_pedagogical_evaluation","14690869_Alpha_frequency_cognitive_load_and_memory_performance","14443651_Age_increases_brain_complexity","14230396_Approaches_to_verbal_visual_and_musical_creativity_by_EEG_coherence_analysis"]}
