To this aim, we systematically reviewed the literature of the last three decades and found 67 articles, of which only a sample of 15 were considered. Based on the findings, we performed a narrative analysis of the studies concerning technological features of OLMs that cater to the three main aspects concerning self‐regulated learning, namely, cognition, metacognition and motivation. Our analysis of the literature confirmed that these three aspects are all subject to some measure of influence. In mutually interacting, these three components support learners to reach a better understanding of their learning process. Specifically, it seems that mostly all three type of OLMs, inspectable, negotiable, and co‐operative, with simple and complex graphical presentation of their learner models and capacity to colour‐code and compare—alike appear optimal for augmenting cognition, metacognition, and motivation. They seemingly do so through offering a wealth of techniques pertaining to knowledge, difficulties, and misconception visualization. The results presented suggest that OLMs have a positive impact on learners' active thinking regarding their learning process.","authors":["Danial Hooshyar","Külli Kori","Margus Pedaste","Emanuele
