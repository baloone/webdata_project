{"id":"222424750_Towards_an_integrated_E-mail_forensic_analysis_framework","abstract":"Due to its simple and inherently vulnerable nature, e-mail communication is abused for numerous illegitimate purposes. E-mail spamming, phishing, drug trafficking, cyber bullying, racial vilification, child pornography, and sexual harassment are some common e-mail mediated cyber crimes. Presently, there is no adequate proactive mechanism for securing e-mail systems. In this context, forensic analysis plays a major role by examining suspected e-mail accounts to gather evidence to prosecute criminals in a court of law. To accomplish this task, a forensic investigator needs efficient automated tools and techniques to perform a multi-staged analysis of e-mail ensembles with a high degree of accuracy, and in a timely fashion. In this article, we present our e-mail forensic analysis software tool, developed by integrating existing state-of-the-art statistical and machine-learning techniques complemented with social networking techniques. In this framework we incorporate our two proposed authorship attribution approaches; one is presented for the first time in this article.","authors":["Rachid Hadjidj","Mourad Debbabi","Hakim Lounis","Farkhund Iqbal"],"meta":["March 2009Digital Investigation 5(3):124-137","DOI:10.1016/j.diin.2009.01.004","SourceDBLP"],"references":["274417440_Writeprints_A_Stylometric_Approach_to_Identity-level_Identification_and_Similarity_Detection_in_Cyberspace","274218759_Name_Discrimination_and_E-mail_Clustering_Using_Unsupervised_Clustering_of_Similar_Contexts","250900159_Feature-Finding_for_Text_Classification","246175447_Feature_finding_for_text_classification","234829413_Mining_Email_Content_for_Author_Identification_Forensics","222435617_A_novel_approach_of_mining_write-prints_for_authorship_attribution_in_e-mail_forensics","221046352_Gender-Preferential_Text_Mining_of_E-mail_Discourse","221000723_Mining_spam_email_to_identify_common_origins_for_forensic_application","220888390_Name_Discrimination_and_Email_Clustering_using_Unsupervised_Clustering_and_Labeling_of_Similar_Contexts","200043124_Mining_Association_Rules_Between_Sets_of_Items_in_Large_Databases_SIGMOD_Conference","314720873_MET_an_experimental_system_for_Malicious_Email_Tracking","285278428_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features","254893781_Outside_the_cave_of_shadows_Using_syntactic_annotation_to_enhance_authorship_attribution","243785947_Analysing_for_Authorship_A_Guide_to_the_Cusum_Technique","243776767_Outside_the_cave_of_shadows_Using_syntactic_annotation_to_enhance_authorship_attribution","240157352_Automatic_Subspace_Clustering_of_High_Dimensional_Data_for_data_mining_applications","239061498_The_Evolution_of_Stylometry_in_Humanities_Scholarship","228362001_MET_an_experimental_system_for_Malicious_Email_Tracking","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","224683307_Adding_Semantics_to_Email_Clustering","222411422_The_Structure_and_Function_of_Complex_Networks","221996712_Introduction_of_decision_trees","221585414_A_temporal_based_forensic_analysis_of_electronic_communication","221246835_Authorship_Analysis_in_Cybercrime_Investigation","220432882_A_framework_for_authorship_identification_of_Online_messages_Writing-style_features_and_classification_techniques","215721756_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","200044630_Newman_MEJ_The_structure_and_function_of_complex_networks_SIAM_Review","6104515_The_Characteristic_Curve_of_Composition","4114454_E-mail_authorship_mining_based_on_SVM_for_computer_forensic","3249749_An_Introduction_to_Computing_with_Neural_Nets","2605577_Newman_MEJ_The_structure_and_function_of_complex_networks_SIAM_Rev_45_167-256","2243518_Mining_E-mail_Authorship"]}
