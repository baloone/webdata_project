{"id":"344556906_Spectroscopic_detection_of_traumatic_brain_injury_severity_and_biochemistry_from_the_retina","abstract":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major burden on healthcare services worldwide, where scientific and clinical innovation is needed to provide better understanding of biochemical damage to improve both pre-hospital assessment and intensive care monitoring. Here, we present an unconventional concept of using Raman spectroscopy to measure the biochemical response to the retina in an ex-vivo murine model of TBI. Through comparison to spectra from the brain and retina following injury, we elicit subtle spectral changes through the use of multivariate analysis, linked to a decrease in cardiolipin and indicating metabolic disruption. The ability to classify injury severity via spectra of the retina is demonstrated for severe TBI (82.0 %), moderate TBI (75.1 %) and sham groups (69.4 %). By showing that optical spectroscopy can be used to explore the eye as the window to the brain, we lay the groundwork for further exploitation of Raman spectroscopy for indirect, non-invasive assessment of brain chemistry.","authors":["Carl Banbury","Iain Styles","Neil Eisenstein","Elisa R Zanier"],"meta":["November 2020Biomedical Optics Express 11(11):6249-6261","DOI:10.1364/BOE.399473","Project: Point of Care Diagnostics for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)"],"references":["334679573_Development_of_the_Self_Optimising_Kohonen_Index_Network_SKiNET_for_Raman_Spectroscopy_Based_Detection_of_Anatomical_Eye_Tissue","326902315_Induction_of_a_transmissible_tau_pathology_by_traumatic_brain_injury","324816283_Estimating_the_global_incidence_of_traumatic_brain_injury","304992699_Pathophysiology_Associated_with_Traumatic_Brain_Injury_Current_Treatments_and_Potential_Novel_Therapeutics","335588817_Nonresonant_Raman_spectroscopy_of_isolated_human_retina_samples_complying_with_laser_safety_regulations_for_in_vivo_measurements","328699884_Disentangling_oxidationhydrolysis_reactions_of_brain_mitochondrial_cardiolipins_in_pathogenesis_of_traumatic_injury","327035475_Raman_Spectroscopy_of_Biological_Tissues","311092260_Label-free_monitoring_of_tissue_biochemistry_following_traumatic_brain_injury_using_Raman_spectroscopy","299343589_Cardiolipin-mediated_procoagulant_activity_of_mitochondria_contributes_to_traumatic_brain_injury-associated_coagulopathy_in_mice","277683222_IR_and_Raman_Spectra-Structure_Correlations"]}
