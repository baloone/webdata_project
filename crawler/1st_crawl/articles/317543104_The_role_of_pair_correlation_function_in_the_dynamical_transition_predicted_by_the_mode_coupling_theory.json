{"id":"317543104_The_role_of_pair_correlation_function_in_the_dynamical_transition_predicted_by_the_mode_coupling_theory","abstract":"In a recent study we have found that for a large number of systems the configuration entropy at pair level, $S_{c2}$, which is primarily determined by the structural information, vanishes at the mode coupling transition temperature $T_{c}$. Thus it appears that the information of the transition temperature is embedded in the structure of the liquid. In order to investigate this we describe the dynamics of the system at the mean field level and using the concepts of the dynamical density function theory show that the dynamics depends only on the structure of the liquid. Thus this theory is similar in spirit to the microscopic MCT. However unlike microscopic MCT, which predicts a very high transition temperature, the present theory predicts a transition temperature which is similar to $T_{c}$. Thus our study reveals that the information of the mode coupling transition temperature is embedded in the structure of the liquid.","authors":["Manoj Kumar Nandi","Atreyee Banerjee","Chandan Dasgupta","Sarika Bhattacharyya"],"meta":["June 2017Physical Review Letters 119(26)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.265502"],"references":["283335823_Generalized_mode-coupling_theory_of_the_glass_transition_Schematic_results_at_finite_and_infinite_order","279632884_Unraveling_the_success_and_failure_of_mode_coupling_theory_from_consideration_of_entropy","269117082_Active_fluidization_in_dense_glassy_systems","261597775_Dynamics_of_Glass_Forming_Liquids_with_Randomly_Pinned_Particles","261368712_Role_of_Structure_and_Entropy_in_Determining_Differences_in_Dynamics_for_Glass_Formers_with_Different_Interaction_Potentials","243473577_Fast_Dynamics_in_CKN_and_CRN_Investigated_by_Dielectric_Spectroscopy","290615776_Fokker-Planck_Equation","279968607_Microscopic_Dynamics_of_Supercooled_Liquids_from_First_Principles","259213725_Dynamics_of_Supercooled_Liquids_and_the_Glass_Transition","253970089_The_Role_of_Repulsive_Forces_in_Determining_the_Equilibrium_Structure_of_Simple_Liquids"]}
