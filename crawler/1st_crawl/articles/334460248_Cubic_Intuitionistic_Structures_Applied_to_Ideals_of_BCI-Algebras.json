{"id":"334460248_Cubic_Intuitionistic_Structures_Applied_to_Ideals_of_BCI-Algebras","abstract":"In this paper, the notion of closed cubic intuitionistic ideals, cubic intuitionistic p -ideals and cubic intuitionistic a -ideals in BCI -algebras are introduced, and several related properties are investigated. Relations between cubic intuitionistic subalgebras, closed cubic intuitionistic ideals, cubic intuitionistic q -ideals, cubic intuitionistic p -ideals and cubic intuitionistic a -ideals are discussed. Conditions for a cubic intuitionistic ideal to be a cubic intuitionistic p -ideal are provided. Characterizations of a cubic intuitionistic a -ideal are considered. The cubic intuitionistic extension property for a cubic intuitionistic a -ideal is established.","authors":["Tapan Senapati","Young Bae Jun","G.
