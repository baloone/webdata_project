{"id":"291989550_Linearized_scattering_of_surface_waves_on_a_spherical_Earth","abstract":"Recently, a formalism for 3-D surface-wave scattering in a plane geometry was derived. The theory of surface-wave scattering relies heavily on a dyadic decomposition of the Green's function, and a new derivation is given for the (dyadic) Green's function of a spherically symmetric Earth. This leads to a linearized formalism for 3-D surface-wave scattering on a sphere. Even for shallow surface waves the effects of sphericity are important and necessitate a modification of the propagator terms in the expression for the scattered surface waves. -from Authors","authors":["R.
