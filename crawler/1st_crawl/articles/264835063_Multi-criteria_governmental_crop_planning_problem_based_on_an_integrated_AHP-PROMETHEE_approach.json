{"id":"264835063_Multi-criteria_governmental_crop_planning_problem_based_on_an_integrated_AHP-PROMETHEE_approach","abstract":"The study uses analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) to deal with the crop planning problem as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, for governmental lands in Gaza Strip under two conditions: the normal economy condition and the resistant economy condition. These two conditions are studied from the governmental point of view. The study goal is to rank crops according to some considered criteria. Crops are divided into eight types that include vegetables, fruits, citrus, olives, palms, export crops, field crops and medical and aromatic crops. The developed AHP and PROMETHEE compare crops with respect to seven main criteria, namely; economical, financial, marketing, environmental, technical, political and social criteria. AHP is used to obtain criteria weights to be used as input for PROMETHEE to outrank alternatives. The results indicate that in resistant economy condition, field crops, olives and palms are the most important crops, while in normal economy condition, vegetables, citrus and export crops are the most important crops.","authors":["Salah R.
