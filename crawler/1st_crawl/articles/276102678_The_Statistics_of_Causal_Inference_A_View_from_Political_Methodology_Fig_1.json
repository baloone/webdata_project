{"id":"276102678_The_Statistics_of_Causal_Inference_A_View_from_Political_Methodology_Fig_1","abstract":"Many areas of political science focus on causal questions. Evidence from statistical analyses is often used to make the case\nfor causal relationships. While statistical analyses can help establish causal relationships, it can also provide strong evidence\nof causality where none exists. In this essay, I provide an overview of the statistics of causal inference. Instead of focusing\non specific statistical methods, such as matching, I focus more on the assumptions needed to give statistical estimates a\ncausal interpretation. Such assumptions are often referred to as identification assumptions, and these assumptions are critical\nto any statistical analysis about causal effects. I outline a wide range of identification assumptions and highlight the design-based\napproach to causal inference. I conclude with an overview of statistical methods that are frequently used for causal inference.","authors":["Luke John Keele"],"meta":["July 2015Political Analysis 23(3)","DOI:10.1093/pan/mpv007"],"references":["333749408_Mostly_Harmless_Econometrics_An_Empiricist's_Companion","309896554_The_Balance-Sample_Size_Frontier_in_Matching_Methods_for_Causal_Inference_THE_BALANCE-SAMPLE_SIZE_FRONTIER","308345346_Optimal_Bandwidth_Choice_for_the_Regression_Discontinuity_Estimator","302205066_Planning_an_Observational_Study","290329066_Causal_Inference_for_Statistics_Social_and_Biomedical_Sciences_An_Introduction","288260689_Estimating_causal_effects_if_treatment_in_randomized_and_nonrandomized_studies","287378627_Natural_Experiments_in_the_Social_Sciences_A_Design-Based_Approach","285649830_Latent_variable_modeling_and_applications_to_causality","284650484_Causality_without_counterfactuals_with_discussion","283605528_Presidential_address_to_the_First_Indian_Statistical_Congress"]}
