{"id":"228578228_Teaching_Electrical_Engineering_Using_Maple","abstract":"Many electrical engineering (EE) students have difficulty in learning technical subjects because they lack sufficient competence in mathematical modeling and in algebra. Maple is a powerful program for doing symbolic algebra, numerical calculation, and plotting of graphs, so using this program allows students to spend more time on modeling and interpreting results. Maple also has a text editor, which makes it feasible to require students to explain their results in writing. The design of Maple documents suitable for EE teaching is discussed; a standard format, including bibliographical information, is recommended for easier use.","authors":["Ola RÃ¸yrvik"],"meta":["October 2002International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education 39(4)","DOI:10.7227/IJEEE.39.4.1"],"references":["302349872_Chemical_Engineering_with_Maple","247400128_Resequencing_Skills_and_Concepts_in_Applied_Calculus_Using_the_Computer_as_a_Tool","246454204_Incorporating_Group_Writing_Instruction_in_Engineering_Courses","243776628_Combining_Kolb_Learning_Styles_and_Writing_to_Learn_in_Engineering_Classes","243776627_Resequencing_skills_and_concepts_in_applied_calculus_using_the_computer_as_tool_Journal_for_Research_in_Mathematics_Education_19_3-25","232515246_Basic_functions_through_the_lens_of_computer_algebra_systems","3050361_Computer-aided_analog_electronics_teaching","3050240_Use_of_Symbolic_Computation_in_Engineering_Education"]}
