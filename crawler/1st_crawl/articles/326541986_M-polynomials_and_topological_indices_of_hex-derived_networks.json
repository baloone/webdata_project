{"id":"326541986_M-polynomials_and_topological_indices_of_hex-derived_networks","abstract":"Hex-derived network has a variety of useful applications in pharmacy, electronics, and networking. In this paper, we give general form of the M-polynomial of the hex-derived networks HDN1 [ n ] and HDN2 [ n ], which came out of n-dimensional hexagonal mesh. We also give closed forms of several degree-based topological indices associated to these networks.","authors":["Shin Min Kang","Waqas Nazeer","Manzoor Ahmad Zahid","Abdul Rauf Nizami"],"meta":["July 2018Open Physics 16(1):394-403","DOI:10.1515/phys-2018-0054"],"references":["345718123_Some_Computational_Aspects_of_Triangular_Boron_Nanotubes","311455848_M-Polynomial_and_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_Polyhex_Nanotubes","310606373_Some_Invariants_of_Circulant_Graphs","309601538_M-Polynomials_and_Topological_Indices_of_Titania_Nanotubes","308490742_M-Polynomial_and_Related_Topological_Indices_of_Nanostar_Dendrimers","328802158_On_molecular_topological_properties_of_hex-derived_networks","297477116_The_first_Zagreb_indices_30_years_after","295875019_On_molecular_topological_properties_of_hex-derived_networks","285380950_Some_properties_of_the_Wiener_polynomial","283868817_Valence_connectivity_versus_Randic_Zagreb_and_modified_Zagreb_index_A_linear_algorithm_to_check_discriminative_properties_of_indices_in_acyclic_molecular_graphs"]}
