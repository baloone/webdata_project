This article presents generalizations of above results by omitting the assumption that all closed and bounded subsets are compact.\n\n1. Introduction\nThere are numerous studies on interpolation inequalities in literature. In 1999, Chua [1] gave some weighted Sobolev interpolation inequalities on product spaces. Badr and Russ [2] proved some Littlewood-Paley inequalities and interpolation results for Sobolev spaces. Interpolation is considered as one of the central concepts in pure logic. Various interpolation properties find their applications in computer science and have many deep purely logical consequences (see [3, 4]). Gogatishvili and Koskela [5] presented variant interpolation properties of Besov spaces defined on metric spaces. Going in the same direction in the setting of metric spaces via contraction mappings, Karapinar [6] presented the concept of an interpolative Kannan contraction mapping and proved that this mapping admits a fixed point on complete metric spaces. Later on, this notation has been extended into several directions (see [7–18]).\nIn [6], Karapinar presented the interpolative Kannan contraction as follows: a mapping is an interpolative Kannan contraction if for all with , where and . This inequality was further refined by Karapinar et al. [7] by for all , where , , and .\nGaba and Karapinar [9] further modified the interpolative Kannan contraction concept in the following way: a mapping is a -interpolative Kannan contraction, if for all , where , with . Karapinar et al. [10] gave the interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction as follows: a mapping is called an interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction if for each , where and with .\nLater on, Debnath and De La Sen [12] extended the above definition to set valued interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction mappings on b-metric spaces and proved that on complete b-metric spaces, whose all closed and bounded subsets are compact, the set valued interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction mapping has a fixed point.\nOn the other hand, Bakhtin [19] and Czerwik [20] introduced the notion of b-metric spaces.\nDefinition 1 (see [19, 20]). Let be a nonempty set and be a function so that for all and some , Then, is a b-metric on , and is called a b-metric space with a coefficient .\nFor related works in this setting, see [21–23]. From now on, is a b-metric space with a coefficient . In the whole paper, is the coefficient of the b-metric space.\nDefinition 2 (see [20]). We have the following: (a)A sequence in is said to be Cauchy if (b)A sequence in is said to be convergent to if (c) is said to be complete if every Cauchy sequence in is convergentDenote by the set of nonempty closed bounded subsets of . For , consider where . The functional defined by is known as the Pompieu-Hausdorff b-metric on . We state the following known lemma.\nLemma 3 (see [24]). Let be a b-metric space . Let and . We have the two following statements:\n(i) For each , there is so that (ii) For each , there is so that This article presents two new generalizations of set valued interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction mappings. Namely, we ensure the existence of fixed points of such maps on a complete b-metric space without considering the assumption that all closed and bounded subsets must be compact. Two examples are also presented.\n\n2. Main Results\nFirst, we define the notion of -interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contractions.\nDefinition 4. Consider a b-metric space . Also, consider maps and . Such a map is called an -interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction if for each with where and with .\nThe following result ensures the existence of a fixed point of -interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contractions.\nTheorem 5. Consider a complete b-metric space and consider an -interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction map . Also, consider the given assertions. (I)There must exist and such that (II)For each with , we have (III)For each in with and , we have Then, must have a fixed point in .\nProof. By assertion (I) there are and with . If then has a fixed point. Suppose that By (10), we obtain This leads to Since , there is such that Thus, by (15), Note that . Hence, by (17), we get Now, we consider . Then, by (18), we get This implies Note that when we take in (18), then we get , that is, ; hence, this choice is not possible. As and and , then by assertion (II), we get . Again, we consider then by (10), we get Since , there is such that Thus, by (22), we conclude Note that . Hence, by (24), we get Now, we consider . Then, by (18), we get This yields that Note that if we take in (25), then , that is, , which is not possible. From (27) and (20), we get Proceeding in this way, we can obtain a sequence in with , for all and Also, by the construction of , we get By a triangular inequality, we have for , Since the above series is convergent, is a Cauchy sequence in . Completeness of gives in such that . By considering assertion (III), we get . Here, we claim . If the claim is wrong, then for all , for some . From (10), we get From the above, we get . By the triangular inequality, we have By taking the limit , we get , that is, . Therefore, our claim is valid.\nExample 1. Consider with for all . Define by and by\nNote that\nCase 1. If with , we get .\nCase 2. If with , we get\nCase 3. If and , we get .\nAfter calculating the values, it is easy to see that\nFor Case1: if with , we get for each with .\nFor Case2: if with , we get for each with .\nFor Case3: if and , we get for each with . By keeping these calculations in mind, one can check that all the hypotheses of Theorem 5 are valid. Hence, must have a fixed point.\nThe following definition presents a multiplicative -interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction.\nDefinition 6. Consider a b-metric space . Also, consider the maps and . Such is called a multiplicative -interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction if for each with where and with .\nThe following result concerns the existence of fixed points for the above-defined mapping.\nTheorem 7. Consider a complete b-metric space and consider a multiplicative -interpolative Hardy-Rogers type contraction map . Also, consider the given assertions: (i)There must exist and such that (ii)For each with , we have (iii)For each in with and , we have Then possesses a fixed point in .\nProof. Assertion (i) implies the existence of and with . We consider Otherwise, has a fixed point. Then, by (40), we obtain This yields that Since , there is satisfying Thus, by (44), we get Since , we get using (46), Consider . Then, by (47), we get This implies that If we take in (47), then we get , that is, , which is not possible. Since , , and , by assertion (ii), we get . Applying (40) and again assertion (ii), we can obtain a sequence in with , for all and Also, by construction of , we know that By a triangular inequality, we have for , This implies that is a Cauchy sequence in . Since is complete, . By assertion (iii), we get for all . Now, we claim that . Assume the claim is wrong, then for all for some . Then by (40), we get From the above inequality, we get . By a triangular inequality, we have Hence, by taking the limit , we get , that is, .\nExample 2. Consider with for all . Define by and by One can see that all the hypotheses of Theorem 7 are valid. Hence, must have a fixed point.\nRemark 8. Note that ([12], Theorem 2) is not applicable in Example 2. It suffices to take and , then and . Thus, we have , , , , , and . One then writes for all . Thus, our main results generalize and improve the result given in [12]. Moreover, when considering the single valued case in Theorem 5 and Theorem 7, that is, for a self-mapping , we get generalizations of the main results in [9].\n\nData Availability\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests concerning the publication of this article.\n\nAuthors’ Contributions\nAll authors contributed equally and significantly in writing this article.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, has funded this project, under grant no.
