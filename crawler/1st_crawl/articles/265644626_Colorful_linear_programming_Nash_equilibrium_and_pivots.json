{"id":"265644626_Colorful_linear_programming_Nash_equilibrium_and_pivots","abstract":"The colorful Carath\\'eodory theorem, proved by B\\'ar\\'any in 1982, states\nthat given $d+1$ sets of points $S_1,\\ldots,S_{d+1}$ in $\\mathbb R^d$, such\nthat each $S_i$ contains $0$ in its convex hull, there exists a set\n$T\\subseteq\\bigcup_{i=1}^{d+1}S_i$ containing $0$ in its convex hull and such\nthat $|T\\cap S_i|\\leq 1$ for all $i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,d+1\\}$. An intriguing question\n-- still open -- is whether such a set $T$, whose existence is ensured, can be\nfound in polynomial time. In 1997, B\\'ar\\'any and Onn defined colorful linear\nprogramming as algorithmic questions related to the colorful Carath\\'eodory\ntheorem. The question we just mentioned comes under colorful linear\nprogramming.\nWe present new complexity results for colorful linear programming problems\nand propose a variant of the \"B\\'ar\\'any-Onn\" algorithm, which is an algorithm\ncomputing a set $T$ whose existence is ensured by the colorful Carath\\'eodory\ntheorem. Our algorithm makes a clear connection with the simplex algorithm.\nSome combinatorial versions of the colorful Carath\\'eodory theorem are also\ndiscussed from an algorithmic point of view. Finally, we show that computing a\nNash equilibrium in a bimatrix game is polynomially reducible to a colorful\nlinear programming problem. On our track, we found a new way to prove that a\ncomplementarity problem belongs to the PPAD class with the help of Sperner's\nlemma.","authors":["Frédéric Meunier","Pauline Sarrabezolles"],"meta":["September 2014Discrete Applied Mathematics 240","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2016.10.006","SourcearXiv"],"references":["240161403_Orientation_in_Complementary_Pivot_Algorithms","235694479_Very_Colorful_Theorems","220485532_A_Further_Generalization_of_the_Colourful_Caratheodory_Theorem","38008795_On_the_complexity_of_four_polyhedral_set_containment_problems","37465041_Points_surrounding_the_origin","4859858_The_Approximation_of_Fixed_Points_of_a_Continous_Mapping","2120161_Colourful_Simplicial_Depth","310845524_Colourful_linear_programming","309663532_The_approximation_of_fixed_points_of_a_continuous_mappings_SIAM","268247306_The_complexity_of_finding_Nash_equilibria","268022630_Computing_and_proving_with_pivots","265454880_Equilibrium_Points_of_Bi-Matrix_Games","265447611_A_generalization_of_Caratheodory's_theorem","256694418_PPAD-completeness_of_polyhedral_versions_of_Sperner's_Lemma","256221965_How_Easy_Is_Local_Search","256157571_Complementary_bases_of_a_matroid","238806453_On_the_e-perturbation_method_for_avoiding_degeneracy","238340657_The_Diet_Problem","237324069_On_the_Complexity_of_2D_Discrete_Fixed_Point_Problem_Extended_Abstract","234799288_Lectures_on_Discrete_Geometry","232272886_Oriented_Euler_Complexes_and_Signed_Perfect_Matchings","228574747_Colourful_Linear_Programming_and_its_Relatives","227037929_Matroid_intersection_algorithms","226843889_Neuer_Beweis_fr_die_Invarianz_der_Dimensionzahl_und_des_Gebietes","225443453_On_the_Complexity_of_2D_Discrete_Fixed_Point_Problem","223058592_On_the_Complexity_of_the_Parity_Argument_and_Other_Inefficient_Proofs_of_Existence","222416823_The_Colourful_Feasibility_Problem","220533292_Quadratically_Many_Colorful_Simplices","1764892_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria"]}
