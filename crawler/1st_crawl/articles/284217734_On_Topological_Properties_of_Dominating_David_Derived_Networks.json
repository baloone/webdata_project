{"id":"284217734_On_Topological_Properties_of_Dominating_David_Derived_Networks","abstract":"Topological indices are numerical parameters of a graph that characterize its molecular topology and are usually graph invariant. In a QSAR/QSPR study, the physico-chemical properties and topological indices such as the Randić, atom-bond connectivity (ABC), and geometric-arithmetic (GA) indices are used to predict the bioactivity of chemical compounds. Graph theory has found a considerable use in this important area of research. All of the studied interconnection networks in this paper are constructed by the Star of David network. In this paper, we study the general Randić, first Zagreb, ABC, GA, ABC4 and GA5, indices for the first, second, and third types of dominating David derived networks and give closed formulas of these indices for these networks. These results are useful in network science to understand the underlying topologies of these networks.","authors":["Muhammad Imran","A. Q.
