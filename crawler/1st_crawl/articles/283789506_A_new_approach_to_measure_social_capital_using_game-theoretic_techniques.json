{"id":"283789506_A_new_approach_to_measure_social_capital_using_game-theoretic_techniques","abstract":"Although the notion of social capital has been extensively studied in various bodies of the literature , there is no universally accepted definition or measure of this concept. In this article, we discuss a new approach for measuring social capital which builds upon cooperative game theory. The new approach not only turns out to be a natural tool for modeling social capital, but also captures various aspects of this phenomenon that are not captured by other approaches.","authors":["Tomasz Michalak","Talal Rahwan","Stefano Moretti","Ramasuri Narayanam"],"meta":["November 2015ACM SIGecom Exchanges 14(1):95-100","DOI:10.1145/2845926.2845933"],"references":["313513572_Network_measures_of_social_capital","286612372_Algorithms_for_the_shapley_and_myerson_values_in_graph-restricted_games","262277099_Computational_Analysis_of_Connectivity_Games_with_Applications_to_the_Investigation_of_Terrorist_Networks","261857128_A_new_approach_to_betweenness_centrality_based_on_the_Shapley_Value","287246046_A_shapley_value-based_approach_to_determine_gatekeepers_in_social_networks_with_applications","286017430_A_centrality_measure_for_networks_with_community_structure_based_on_a_generalization_of_the_owen_value","284289939_A_Value_for_n-Person_Games","276227040_On_the_Role_of_Coalitional_Network_Games_in_Modelling_the_Social_Dimension_in_Ecosystem_Management","274543775_Applied_Network_Analysis_A_Methodological_Introduction","265723240_Bowling_Alone_America's_Declining_Social_Capital"]}
