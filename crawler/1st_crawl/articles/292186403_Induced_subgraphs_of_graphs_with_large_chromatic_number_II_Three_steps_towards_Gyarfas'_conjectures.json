{"id":"292186403_Induced_subgraphs_of_graphs_with_large_chromatic_number_II_Three_steps_towards_Gyarfas'_conjectures","abstract":"Gyárfás conjectured in 1985 that for all k, ℓ, every graph with no clique of size more than k and no odd hole of length more than ℓ has chromatic number bounded by a function of k, ℓ. We prove three weaker statements:\n• Every triangle-free graph with sufficiently large chromatic number has an odd hole of length different from five;\n• For all ℓ, every triangle-free graph with sufficiently large chromatic number contains either a 5-hole or an odd hole of length more than ℓ;\n• For all k, ℓ, every graph with no clique of size more than k and sufficiently large chromatic number contains either a 5-hole or a hole of length more than ℓ.","authors":["Maria Chudnovsky","Alex Scott","Paul Seymour"],"meta":["January 2016Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 118","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2016.01.003"],"references":["311094290_Induced_Subgraphs_of_Graphs_with_Large_Chromatic_Number_III_Long_Holes","283536446_Induced_subgraphs_of_graphs_with_large_chromatic_number_I_Odd_holes","268620905_Problems_from_the_world_surrounding_perfect_graphs","256935872_Induced_Cycles_and_Chromatic_Number"]}
