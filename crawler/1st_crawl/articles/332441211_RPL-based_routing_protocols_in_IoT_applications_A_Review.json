{"id":"332441211_RPL-based_routing_protocols_in_IoT_applications_A_Review","abstract":"In the last few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has proved to be an interesting and promising paradigm that aims to contribute to countless applications by connecting more physical \"things\" to the Internet. Although it emerged as a major enabler for many next generation applications, it also introduced new challenges to already saturated networks. The IoT is already coming to life especially in healthcare and smart environment applications adding a large number of low powered sensors and actuators to improve life style and introduce new services to the community. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed RPL as the routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (LLNs) and standardized it in RFC6550 in 2012. RPL quickly gained interest and many research papers were introduced to evaluate and improve its performance in different applications. In this paper, we present a discussion of the main aspects of RPL and the advantages and disadvantages of using it in different IoT applications. We also review the available research related to RPL in a systematic manner, based on the enhancement area and the service type. In addition to that, we compare related RPL-based protocols in terms of energy efficiency, reliability, flexibility, robustness and security. Finally, we present our conclusions and discuss the possible future directions of RPL and its applicability in the Internet of the future.","authors":["Harith Dheyaa Yahya Kharrufa","Hayder A. A.
