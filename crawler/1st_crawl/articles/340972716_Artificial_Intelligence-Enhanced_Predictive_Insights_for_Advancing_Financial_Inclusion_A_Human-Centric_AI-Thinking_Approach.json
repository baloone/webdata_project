{"id":"340972716_Artificial_Intelligence-Enhanced_Predictive_Insights_for_Advancing_Financial_Inclusion_A_Human-Centric_AI-Thinking_Approach","abstract":"According to the World Bank, a key factor to poverty reduction and improving prosperity is financial inclusion. Financial service providers (FSPs) offering financially-inclusive solutions need to understand how to approach the underserved successfully. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) on legacy data can help FSPs to anticipate how prospective customers may respond when they are approached. However, it remains challenging for FSPs who are not well-versed in computer programming to implement AI projects. This paper proffers a no-coding human-centric AI-based approach to simulate the possible dynamics between the financial profiles of prospective customers collected from 45,211 contact encounters and predict their intentions toward the financial products being offered. This approach contributes to the literature by illustrating how AI for social good can also be accessible for people who are not well-versed in computer science. A rudimentary AI-based predictive modeling approach that does not require programming skills will be illustrated in this paper. In these AI-generated multi-criteria optimizations, analysts in FSPs can simulate scenarios to better understand their prospective customers. In conjunction with the usage of AI, this paper also suggests how AI-Thinking could be utilized as a cognitive scaffold for educing (drawing out) actionable insights to advance financial inclusion.","authors":["Mengleong How","Sin-Mei Cheah","Aik Cheow Khor","Yong Jiet Chan"],"meta":["April 2020Big Data and Cognitive Computing 4(2):8","DOI:10.3390/bdcc4020008"],"references":["339013197_Artificial_Intelligence-Enabled_Predictive_Insights_for_Ameliorating_Global_Malnutrition_A_Human-Centric_AI-Thinking_Approach","338550377_Artificial_Intelligence-Enhanced_Decision_Support_for_Informing_Global_Sustainable_Development_A_Human-Centric_AI-Thinking_Approach","335517836_Water_Quality_Sustainability_Evaluation_under_Uncertainty_A_Multi-Scenario_Analysis_Based_on_Bayesian_Networks","334812968_Future-Ready_Strategic_Oversight_of_Multiple_Artificial_Superintelligence-Enabled_Adaptive_Learning_Systems_via_Human-Centric_Explainable_AI-Empowered_Predictive_Optimizations_of_Educational_Outcomes","334488565_Educing_AI-Thinking_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_Arts_and_Mathematics_STEAM_Education","333999095_Harnessing_Entropy_via_Predictive_Analytics_to_Optimize_Outcomes_in_the_Pedagogical_System_An_Artificial_Intelligence-Based_Bayesian_Networks_Approach","333225707_Educational_Stakeholders'_Independent_Evaluation_of_an_Artificial_Intelligence-Enabled_Adaptive_Learning_System_Using_Bayesian_Network_Predictive_Simulations","333049260_AI_Governance_and_the_Policymaking_Process_Key_Considerations_for_Reducing_AI_Risk","332803107_The_Sustainable_Development_of_Financial_Inclusion_How_Can_Monetary_Policy_and_Economic_Fundamental_Interact_with_It_Effectively","330180894_Beneficial_Artificial_Intelligence_Coordination_by_Means_of_a_Value_Sensitive_Design_Approach"]}
