{"id":"294144430_Kinematic_characteristics_of_a_special_3-UPU_parallel_platform_manipulator","abstract":"This paper discussed kinematic characteristics of a special 3-UPU parallel pyramid manipulator by using two different principals, in every branch two middle revolution pairs were perpendicular to each other. This mechanism has one instantaneous translational degree of freedom and two rotational degrees of freedom, as its moving platform and base being parallel to each other, the mechanism only has three DOF. The three-dimensional distribution of kinematic screws were drawn. All of the results are useful for enriching the mechanism theory and should be applied in the mechanism design.","authors":["S.
