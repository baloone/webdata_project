{"id":"341487322_Scientific_Thought_and_absolutes_for_an_image_of_the_sciences_between_computing_and_biology","abstract":"We propose a reflection on the construction of scientific knowledge and in so doing an image of this knowledge. This will allow us to develop a comparative analysis of some of the main principles underpinning the constitution of the different sciences. We will highlight the role of critical thought in science, or even “negative results,” which pose limits and hence open new trajectories. In particular, we will address a misleading point of view, based on some informal concepts taken from computer science, which dominates the biological imaginary. An “ethics of knowledge” will follow, as a critical and open perspective, capable of taking on the well-intentioned responsibility of proposing universal, though not absolute, principles of knowledge.","authors":["Giuseppe Longo","David Gauthier"],"meta":["May 2020Angelaki Journal of Theoretical Humanities 25(3):120-130","DOI:10.1080/0969725X.2020.1754031","Project: Theoretical Principles for Biology"],"references":["333912844_Interfaces_of_Incompleteness","325537757_Information_and_Causality_Mathematical_Reflections_on_Cancer_Biology_1","318170825_How_Future_Depends_on_Past_and_Rare_Events_in_Systems_of_Life","262486903_Perspectives_on_Organisms_Biological_Time_Symmetries_and_Singularities","262486696_Mathematics_and_the_natural_sciences_The_Physical_Singularity_of_Life","345838410_Genetique_cellulaire_Lecon_inaugurale_prononcee_le_vendredi_7_mai_1965","305631249_Reductionist_perspectives_and_the_notion_of_information","269857633_A_Feeling_for_the_Organism_The_Life_and_Work_of_Barbara_McClintock","262486799_On_the_Relevance_of_Negative_Results","261218422_Coming_Full_Circle-From_Endless_Complexity_to_Simplicity_and_Back_Again"]}
