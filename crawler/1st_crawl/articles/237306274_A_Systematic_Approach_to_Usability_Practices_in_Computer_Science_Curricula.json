{"id":"237306274_A_Systematic_Approach_to_Usability_Practices_in_Computer_Science_Curricula","abstract":"The importance of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) education for software professionals should be evident and well understood, when designing Computer Science (CS) programs, at all levels. Unfortunately there is a lack of HCI courses in Chilean CS programs. The first optional undergraduate HCI course was taught in Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (Chile) back in 2003. Progressive steps were done, including the compulsory graduate HCI course (since 2006). A new project that allows the transition from isolated efforts to a systematic approach started in July 2007.","authors":["Cristian Rusu","Virginica Rusu","Silvana Roncagliolo","José Miguel Rubio León"],"meta":[],"references":["228712247_Human-Computer_Interaction_from_theory_to_practice","222425565_Bridging_patterns_An_approach_to_bridge_gaps_between_SE_and_HCI","220382557_A_method_for_evaluating_the_communicability_of_user_interfaces","221537005_Integration_of_usability_issues_within_initial_software_development_education_It's_all_about_the_user_dummy","220807955_Integrating_usability_engineering_into_the_computer_science_curriculum_a_proposal","220798249_Teaching_HCI_A_Challenging_Intercultural_Interdisciplinary_Cross-Field_Experience","2503502_The_Semiotic_Engineering_of_Human-Computer_Interaction"]}
