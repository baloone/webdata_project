{"id":"301655817_Dynamic_capabilities_and_competitive_advantage_Findings_from_case_studies","abstract":"Our paper highlights the importance of the dynamic capabilities perspective as a field of study in today’s dynamic environment. The dynamic capabilities view has received a lot of attention in recent years, although the outcome is a complex with limited empirical studies. In our study we conducted in-depth interviews in six representative IT firms. The underlying assumption is that firms, which are able to reconfigure their resources and capabilities, in line with recognized opportunities and environmental change, can create and sustain a competitive advantage. We argue that firms with a stronger commitment to deploying dynamic capabilities are more successful, and vice versa. The results suggest that ignoring the deployment of a single dynamic capability can negatively affect the deployment of other dynamic capabilities since they are correlated and interwoven. Our paper is also considered to be important from practitioners’ point of view. We believe the results will help managers to understand how dynamic capabilities work and will guide them in deploying capabilities in their own organizations. © 2016, University of Split - Faculty of Economics.
