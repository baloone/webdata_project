The\nexperimentation was conducted with a sample of 112 Moroccan teachers\nof the region of Fez - Boulemane, who responded to a questionnaire of 16\nmodalities relating to the availability and the use of ICT tools, educational\nmanagement of ICT in classroom, and the trainings and competencies in\nICT and Informatics of the teachers. In order to make an original\ncontribution to the study of the integration of ICT, we adopted a\nmultidimensional analysis in the treatment of the answers of the teachers.\nThus, thanks to a Factorial Analysis of Multiple Correspondence (FAMC),\nwe could take account of the links which exist between the various\nmodalities of our questionnaire to get to identify the most discriminating\nfactors in the integration of ICT, like their order of importance. The results\nof this analysis led to three factorial axes cumulating an absolute inertia of\n70%, respectively representing «the pedagogical contribution and the\nfundamental conditions of a success of the integration of ICT», «the\nadvanced competencies in ICT and Informatics» and «the difficulties of\nuse of ICT in classroom». These axes, in this hierarchy, represent finally\nthe most discriminating factors for a successful integration of ICT.","authors":["Anouar Alami"],"meta":["July 2016European Scientific Journal 12(19):164","DOI:10.19044/esj.2016.v12n19p164"],"references":["269949435_Impact_of_Using_Java_Software_of_Geometrical_Optics_JSGO_on_the_Construction_Success_of_the_Virtual_Image_among_the_First_Year_University_Students"]}
