{"id":"257627192_Data_hiding_by_an_improved_exploiting_modification_direction","abstract":"This paper represents an improved data hiding scheme, CIE, which uses a codebook to improve the Exploiting Modification Direction (EMD) embedding scheme. In our scheme, one secret (2n + x\n− 1)-ary digit is hidden in a group of pixels in an image as a modified secret digit. Our proposed scheme has an embedding rate \n\n$R=\\log_2(2^{n+x}-1)/n$\n, which is greater than the rate of the EMD scheme, which is R = log2(2n + 1)/n for n ≥ 2 . Embedding rate R is the number of secret bits embedded in each cover pixel. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is able to embed 3 times as many secret bits in an image compared to the original EMD embedding scheme when n = 2 and x = 5. Our scheme has low time complexity and achieves this higher embedding performance while retaining reasonable perceptual quality for the image. An experiment verifies these features of our proposed data hiding scheme.","authors":["Cheonshik Kim"],"meta":["April 2014Multimedia Tools and Applications 69(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-012-1114-0"],"references":["277422914_Cyber_warfare","232631959_Improved_Data_Hiding_Method_by_Exploiting_Modification_Direction","220942102_Detecting_LSB_matching_by_applying_calibration_technique_for_difference_image","220427158_Cyber_warfare_steganography_vs_steganalysis","220354258_Techniques_for_Data_Hiding","45825490_Improved_Exploiting_Modification_Direction_Method_by_Modulus_Operation","26621385_A_Novel_Image_Data_Hiding_Scheme_with_Diamond_Encoding","3437465_Hide_and_seek_An_introduction_to_steganography","3417888_Efficient_Steganographic_Embedding_by_Exploiting_Modification_Direction","3343443_LSB_matching_revisited","3338654_Detecting_LSB_steganography_in_color_and_gray-scale_images","326998736_A_Novel_Information_Concealing_Method_Based_on_Exploiting_Modification_Direction","312888624_Efficient_steganographic_embedding_by_exploiting_modification_direction","226192944_Improved_Steganographic_Embedding_Exploiting_Modification_Direction_in_Multimedia_Communications","223607321_Hiding_secret_data_in_images_via_predictive_coding","223363793_An_improvement_of_EMD_embedding_method_for_large_payloads_by_pixel_segmentation_strategy","222831750_A_steganographic_method_based_upon_JPEG_and_quantization_table_modification","222646245_A_hierarchical_digital_watermarking_method_for_image_tamper_detection_and_recovery","222564467_Hiding_data_in_images_by_simple_LSB_substitution","222511395_BPCS_steganography_using_EZW_lossy_compressed_images","222164489_Four-scanning_attack_on_hierarchical_digital_watermarking_method_for_image_tamper_detection_and_recovery","220722308_F5-A_Steganographic_Algorithm","220722182_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","4369160_A_High_Payload_Steganographic_Scheme_Based_on_7_4_Hamming_Code_for_Digital_Images","3343272_Steganalysis_of_LSB_matching_in_grayscale_images","3309330_Robust_Lossless_Image_Data_Hiding_Designed_for_Semi-Fragile_Image_Authentication"]}
