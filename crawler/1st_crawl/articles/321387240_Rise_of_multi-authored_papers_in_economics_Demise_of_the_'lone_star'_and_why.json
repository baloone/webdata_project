{"id":"321387240_Rise_of_multi-authored_papers_in_economics_Demise_of_the_'lone_star'_and_why","abstract":"This paper builds on previous work by reviewing the key literature relating to the rise in co-authorship in economics and by presenting further new evidence on several features of co-authorship in articles in economic journals. The empirical analysis draws on around 175,000 articles in the top 255 journals, over the period 1996–2014. The rises in quarto-plus and cross-country co-authored papers are striking, as are the differences in citations per article and citations per author. There is evidence of an alphabetical ordering of authors as the standard in co-authored papers in top journals with no downward trend evident over time. A correlation between co-authorship and career stage is observed with young authors publishing significantly more solo-authored articles.","authors":["Lukas Kuld","John O’Hagan"],"meta":["November 2017Scientometrics 114(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-017-2588-3"],"references":["309367035_Citations_journal_ranking_and_multiple_authorships_reconsidered_evidence_from_almost_one_million_articles","292386262_The_rise_in_co-authorship_in_the_social_sciences_1980-2013","264718007_Coauthorship_of_Journal_Articles_and_Book_Chapters_in_the_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities_2000-2010","256042823_Six_Decades_of_Top_Economics_Publishing_Who_and_How","24108596_Estimates_of_the_Returns_to_Quality_and_Co-autorship_in_Economic_Academia","24091876_Getting_Closer_or_Drifting_Apart","6397622_The_Increasing_Dominance_of_Teams_in_Production_of_Knowledge","4902058_Trends_in_Multi-Authored_Papers_in_Economics","356305416_Did_Cheaper_Flights_Change_the_Direction_of_Science","316946260_Recognition_for_Group_Work_Gender_Differences_in_Academia","314794468_Did_Cheaper_Flights_Change_the_Direction_of_Science","312052000_Catching_up_or_falling_behind_Promising_changes_and_persistent_patterns_across_cohorts_of_economics_PhDs_in_German-speaking_countries_from_1991_to_2008","301664319_Citations_journal_ranking_and_multiple_authorships_evidence_based_on_the_top_300_papers_in_economics","287798940_Recent_trends_in_co-authorship_in_economics_evidence_from_RePEc","287348462_Academic_rankings_between_the_republic_of_science_and_new_public_management","280685184_The_Burden_of_Knowledge_and_the_Death_of_the_Renaissance_Man_Is_Innovation_Getting_Harder","264562815_Page_Limits_on_Economics_Articles_Evidence_from_Two_Journals","256043809_Nine_Facts_About_Top_Journals_in_Economics","227606612_Trends_in_co-authorship_in_economics_since_1985","227360338_Matching_and_Network_Effects","227357770_An_Updated_Ranking_of_Journals_in_Economics","222758010_Collaboration_and_the_quality_of_economics_research","24094675_The_Rising_Incidence_of_Co-Authorship_in_Economics_Further_Evidence","24094104_The_Determinants_of_Co-Authorship_An_Analysis_of_the_Economics_Literature","23968311_The_Burden_of_Knowledge_and_the_Death_of_the_Renaissance_Man_Is_Innovation_Getting_Harder","5187681_Restructuring_Research_Communication_Costs_and_the_Democratization_of_University_Innovation"]}
