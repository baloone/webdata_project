{"id":"319622759_Deep_Subspace_Clustering_Networks","abstract":"We present a novel deep neural network architecture for unsupervised subspace clustering. This architecture is built upon deep auto-encoders, which non-linearly map the input data into a latent space. Our key idea is to introduce a novel self-expressive layer between the encoder and the decoder to mimic the \"self-expressiveness\" property that has proven effective in traditional subspace clustering. Being differentiable, our new self-expressive layer provides a simple but effective way to learn pairwise affinities between all data points through a standard back-propagation procedure. Being nonlinear, our neural-network based method is able to cluster data points having complex (often nonlinear) structures. We further propose pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that let us effectively learn the parameters of our subspace clustering networks. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised subspace clustering methods.","authors":["Pan Ji","Tong Zhang","Hongdong Li","Mathieu Salzmann"],"meta":["September 2017","Project: Unsupervised clustering using deep learning"],"references":["302583701_Oracle_Based_Active_Set_Algorithm_for_Scalable_Elastic_Net_Subspace_Clustering","301839500_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","301036519_Oracle_Based_Active_Set_Algorithm_for_Scalable_Elastic_Net_Subspace_Clustering","289406681_Kernel_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering_on_Symmetric_Positive_Definite_Manifolds","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","311609394_Scalable_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering_by_Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit","289541573_Provable_subspace_clustering_When_LRR_meets_SSC","286108157_Robust_Subspace_Segmentation_with_Block-Diagonal_Prior","284219015_Unsupervised_Deep_Embedding_for_Clustering_Analysis"]}
