{"id":"303931549_Helping_the_Tester_Get_It_Right_Towards_Supporting_Agile_Combinatorial_Test_Design","abstract":"Combinatorial test design (CTD) is an effective test planning technique that reveals faulty feature interaction in a given system. CTD takes a systematic approach to formally model the system to be tested, and propose test cases ensuring coverage of given conditions or interactions between parameters. In this position paper we propose a framework for supporting agile CTD, a human-centered methodology, which takes into account the human testerâ€™s possible mistakes and supports revision and refinement. In this approach a combinatorial model of the system and test plans are constructed in an incremental and iterative way, providing the tester with the ability to refine and validate the constructions. We propose a formal framework which can be used as a theoretical foundation for the development of agile CTD support tools, and describe a use case of an envisioned tool.","authors":["Anna Zamansky","Eitan Farchi"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-49224-6_4","Conference: International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods"],"references":["3188430_Software_Fault_Interactions_and_Implications_for_Software_Testing","315438511_Introduction_to_Combinatorial_Testing","300799579_Introduction_to_Combinatorial_Testing","277108955_Human_Factors_in_Software_Development_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","266672894_Automatic_Generation_of_Combinatorial_Test_Data","262282255_Engineering_product_usability_A_review_and_analysis_techniques","254034714_Common_Patterns_in_Combinatorial_Models","237237435_Selecting_Human_Error_Types_for_Cognitive_Modelling_and_Simulation","221096737_Consideration_of_Human_Factors_for_Prioritizing_Test_Cases_for_the_Software_System_Test","220566704_A_Survey_of_Combinatorial_Testing","3188200_A_test_generation_strategy_for_pairwise_testing"]}
