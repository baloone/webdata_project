{"id":"353423955_An_Argument_for_Interdisciplinary_Programs_in_Cybersecurity","abstract":"In this commentary Dr. Giever presents a compelling argument for interdisciplinary programs in cybersecurity at the university level. He argues that we no longer have the luxury of allowing barriers to exist between those tasked with IT security and those who provide physical security. He recommends that any security program take an “all possible paths” or “balanced approach” to the protection of assets within an organization. Students in computer science, criminal justice, business, human resources, and others should work collaboratively within education programs learning these necessary skills. A team effort is needed to accomplish the myriad of tasks necessary to protect assets today. Graduates from such programs will possess the skills and abilities to work collaboratively on a comprehensive security design for their organization.","authors":["Dennis Giever"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.52306/01010718QKYZ9556"],"references":["266039774_The_Gift_of_Fear_Survival_Signals_That_Protect_Us_from_Violence_by","234806566_The_Art_of_Deception_Controlling_the_Human_Element_of_Security"]}
