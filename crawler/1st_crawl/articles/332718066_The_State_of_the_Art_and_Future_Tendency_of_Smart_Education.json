Firstly, we investigate and analyze the data mining technologies of two kinds of educational big data including teaching behavior and massive knowledge resources. Secondly, we focus on four vital technologies in teaching process such as learning guidance, recommendation, Q&A and evaluation, including learning path generation and navigation, learner profiling and personalized recommendations, online smart Q&A and precise evaluation. Then we compare and analyze the mainstream smart education platforms at home and abroad. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current smart education research and summarize the research and development directions of online smart learning assistants, learner smart assessment, networked group cognition, causality discovery and other smart education aspects.","authors":["Q.
