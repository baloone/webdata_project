Patients with suspected OSA were enrolled from July 5, 2017, to October 31, 2018.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nObstructive sleep apnea diagnosis required either evoking signs or symptoms or related medical or psychiatric comorbidities coupled with a PSG-derived respiratory disturbance index (PSG-RDI) of at least 5 events/h. A PSG-RDI of at least 15 events/h satisfied the diagnosis criteria even in the absence of associated symptoms or comorbidities. Patients who did not meet these criteria were classified as not having OSA. Agreement analysis and diagnostic performance were assessed by Bland-Altman plot comparing PSG-RDI and the Sunrise system RDI (Sr-RDI) with diagnosis threshold optimization via receiver operating characteristic curves, allowing for evaluation of the device sensitivity and specificity in detecting OSA at 5 events/h and 15 events/h.\n\nResults\nAmong 376 consecutive adults with suspected OSA, the mean (SD) age was 49.7 (13.2) years, the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.0 (7.1), and 207 (55.1%) were men. Reliable agreement was found between PSG-RDI and Sr-RDI in patients without OSA (n = 46; mean difference, 1.31; 95% CI, −1.05 to 3.66 events/h) and in patients with OSA with a PSG-RDI of at least 5 events/h with symptoms (n = 107; mean difference, −0.69; 95% CI, −3.77 to 2.38 events/h). An Sr-RDI underestimation of −11.74 (95% CI, −20.83 to −2.67) events/h in patients with OSA with a PSG-RDI of at least 15 events/h was detected and corrected by optimization of the Sunrise system diagnostic threshold. The Sr-RDI showed diagnostic capability, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.93) for corresponding PSG-RDIs of 5 events/h and 15 events/h, respectively. At the 2 optimal cutoffs of 7.63 events/h and 12.65 events/h, Sr-RDI had accuracy of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90-0.94) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.86-0.90) as well as posttest probabilities of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99-0.99) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88-0.91) at PSG-RDIs of at least 5 events/h and at least 15 events/h, respectively, corresponding to positive likelihood ratios of 14.86 (95% CI, 9.86-30.12) and 5.63 (95% CI, 4.92-7.27), respectively.\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nAutomatic analysis of MM patterns provided reliable performance in RDI calculation. The use of this index in OSA diagnosis appears to be promising.","authors":["Jean-Louis Pépin","Clément Letesson","Lê Nhật Đông","Antoine Dedave"],"meta":["January 2020JAMA Network Open 3(1):e1919657","DOI:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.19657"],"references":["330412680_SleepOMICS_how_Big_Data_can_revolutionize_sleep_science","327269872_A_review_on_wearable_photoplethysmography_sensors_and_their_potential_future_applications_in_health_care","323916321_Sleep_deficiency_and_motor_vehicle_crash_risk_in_the_general_population_A_prospective_cohort_study","334341207_Estimation_of_the_global_prevalence_and_burden_of_obstructive_sleep_apnoea_a_literature-based_analysis","330203267_High-performance_medicine_the_convergence_of_human_and_artificial_intelligence","329268871_Cloud_Algorithm-Driven_Oximetry-Based_Diagnosis_of_Obstructive_Sleep_Apnea_in_Symptomatic_Habitually-Snoring_Children","326722543_Management_of_obstructive_sleep_apnoea_in_a_primary_care_vs_sleep_unit_setting_A_randomised_controlled_trial","325481657_Challenges_and_Perspectives_in_Obstructive_Sleep_Apnoea_Report_by_an_ad_hoc_working_group_of_the_Sleep_Disordered_Breathing_Group_of_the_European_Respiratory_Society_and_the_European_Sleep_Research_So","324807168_0315_Inter-_And_Intra-expert_Variability_In_Sleep_Scoring_Comparison_Between_Visual_And_Automatic_Analysis","323247704_Devices_for_Home_Detection_of_Obstructive_Sleep_Apnea_A_Review"]}
