{"id":"339832203_An_Efficient_Image_Encryption_Scheme_Based_on_S-Boxes_and_Fractional-Order_Differential_Logistic_Map","abstract":"In this work, an efficient image encryption based on S-boxes and fractional-order logistic map is proposed. The features of the fractional-order chaotic system in dynamical behaviors are exhibited. By simulation and comparison with the traditional logistic map, it is proved that the fractional-order logistic map contains larger key space and more parameters. Therefore, the fractional-order logistic system has better efficiency and security against cryptanalyst attacks. The S-boxes construction algorithm is proposed. By comparing with the S-boxes of the former schemes, the proposed S-boxes have good performance under Bits Independence Criterion (BIC), the Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) and the nonlinearity. Finally, the image encryption scheme is proposed for the verification. In the encryption process, the proposed S-boxes are used for scrambling and confusion. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the fractional-order method is a preferred approach to integer-order chaotic system.","authors":["Ying-Qian Zhang","Jun-Ling Hao","Xing-Yuan Wang"],"meta":["March 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979827"],"references":["345408351_Application_Based_Construction_and_Optimization_of_Substitution_Boxes_Over_2D_Mixed_Chaotic_Maps","344439041_A_new_construction_of_confusion_component_of_block_ciphers","334024679_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_Arnold_scrambling_and_Lucas_series","333645502_A_novel_chaotic_image_encryption_technique_based_on_multiple_discrete_dynamical_maps","333152124_A_Novel_Image_Encryption_Technique_Based_on_Generalized_Advanced_Encryption_Standard_Based_on_Field_of_Any_Characteristic","330941219_A_new_approach_to_digital_content_privacy_using_quantum_spin_and_finite-state_machine","338177070_Dynamical_Analysis_of_Memcapacitor_Chaotic_System_and_Its_Image_Encryption_Application","337433913_Memristor-Based_Neural_Network_Circuit_of_Full-Function_Pavlov_Associative_Memory_With_Time_Delay_and_Variable_Learning_Rate","330771202_Keyed_Hash_Function_Using_Hyper_Chaotic_System_With_Time-Varying_Parameters_Perturbation","330151703_Dynamic_Analysis_of_Digital_Chaotic_Maps_via_State-Mapping_Networks"]}
