{"id":"290477036_Relating_the_extra_connectivity_and_the_conditional_diagnosability_of_regular_graphs_under_the_comparison_model","abstract":"Extra connectivity and conditional diagnosability are two crucial subjects for a multiprocessor system's ability to tolerate and diagnose faulty processors. The extra connectivity and the conditional diagnosability of many well-known multiprocessor systems have been widely investigated. In this paper, the relationship between the extra connectivity and the conditional diagnosability of regular graphs is explored. We establish that the conditional diagnosability under the comparison model is equal to the 2-extra connectivity. Finally, we give empirical analysis on the extra connectivity and conditional diagnosability of some graphs by our proposed relationship.","authors":["Limei Lin","li xu","Shuming Zhou"],"meta":["January 2016Theoretical Computer Science 618","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2015.12.031"],"references":["284142960_A_comparison_connection_assignment_for_self-diagnosis_of_multiprocessor_systems","280063322_The_Extra_Connectivity_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Alternating_Group_Networks","272385924_The_Extra_Restricted_Connectivity_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Split-Star_Networks","263984937_Conditional_fault_diagnosability_of_dual-cubes","263094074_On_3-Extra_Connectivity_and_3-Extra_Edge_Connectivity_of_Folded_Hypercubes","220771266_A_Comparison_Connection_Assignment_for_Diagnosis_of_Multiprocessor_Systems","220246020_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Cayley_Graphs_Generated_by_Transposition_Trees_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","220185761_On_the_extraconnectivity_of_graphs","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","279368676_Reliability_Evaluation_of_Engineering_Systems","279354207_Reliability_Evaluation_of_Engineering_Systems","277960382_On_g-extra_connectivity_of_folded_hypercubes","271933506_Conditional_diagnosability_and_strong_diagnosability_of_shuffle-cubes_under_the_comparison_model","268863546_Topological_Structure_and_Analysis_of_Interconnection_Networks","268749795_Conditional_diagnosability_and_strong_diagnosability_of_Split-Star_Networks_under_the_PMC_model","266729363_Structural_properties_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","265339510_Reliability_Evaluation_of_BC_Networks_in_Terms_of_the_Extra_Vertex-_and_Edge-Connectivity","263903654_CONDITIONAL_DIAGNOSABILITY_OF_CAYLEY_GRAPHS_GENERATED_BY_TRANSPOSITION_TREES_UNDER_THE_COMPARISON_DIAGNOSIS_MODEL","262361667_Note_Bounding_the_size_of_the_subgraph_induced_by_m_vertices_and_extra_edge-connectivity_of_hypercubes","260585635_Reliability_Evaluation_of_BC_Networks","260585389_The_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","260585387_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Alternating_Group_Graphs","257145053_Extraconnectivity_of_-ary_-cube_networks","256936364_The_conditional_fault_diagnosability_of_n_k-star_graphs","256744864_2323-Extraconnectivities_of_hypercube-like_networks","256720578_On_deriving_conditional_diagnosability_of_interconnection_networks","254254732_On_conditional_fault_tolerant_of_dual-cubes","254061964_Strong_Diagnosability_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Augmented_Cubes_Under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","235737467_Algebraic_Connectivity_of_Graphs","224285391_Fault_Diagnosability_of_Arrangement_Graphs","220661925_The_conditional_diagnosability_of_crossed_cubes_under_the_comparison_model","220339827_Conditional_diagnosability_of_hypercubes_under_the_comparison_diagnosis_model","220329229_A_Group-Theoretic_Model_for_Symmetric_Interconnection_Networks","220318681_Extraconnectivity_of_hypercubes_II","220295209_Diagnosability_of_Crossed_Cubes_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","220246153_Comparison-Based_Conditional_Diagnosability_on_the_Class_of_Hypercube-like_Networks","220111456_Conditional_diagnosability_of_alternating_group_networks","3477233_Optimization_of_Reduced_Dependencies_for_Synchronous_Sequential_Machines","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3300295_Diagnosability_of_the_Mobius_cubes","3043034_On_Self-Diagnosable_Multiprocessor_Systems_Diagnosis_by_the_Comparison_Approach"]}
