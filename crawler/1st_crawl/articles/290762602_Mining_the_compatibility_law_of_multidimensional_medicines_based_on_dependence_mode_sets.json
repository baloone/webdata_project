{"id":"290762602_Mining_the_compatibility_law_of_multidimensional_medicines_based_on_dependence_mode_sets","abstract":"A concept of dependence evaluation function and MMDE (Multidimensional Medicine Dependence Evaluation) algorithm were proposed to determine the dependence relationship of multidimensional medicines aiming at mining the compatibility law of multidimensional medicines. The difference function was used to determine the divergence degree of the distribution of medicines, and a new method based on the modified difference function was proposed to compute the dosage of imperfect medicines based on the modified difference function. Experiments showed that the new method for mining the dependence relationship of medicines has accuracy greater than 80%.","authors":["S.-J. Qiao","Changjie Tang","N.
