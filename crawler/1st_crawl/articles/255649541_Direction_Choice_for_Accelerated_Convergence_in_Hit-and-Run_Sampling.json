{"id":"255649541_Direction_Choice_for_Accelerated_Convergence_in_Hit-and-Run_Sampling","abstract":"Hit-and-Run algorithms are Monte Carlo procedures for generating points that are asymptotically distributed according to general absolutely continuous target distribu- tions G over open bounded regions S. Applications include nonredundant constraint identiflcation, global optimization, and Monte Carlo integration. These algorithms are reversible random walks which commonly apply uniformly distributed step directions. We investigate nonuniform direction choice and show that under minimal restrictions on the region S and target distribution G, there exists a unique direction choice dis- tribution, characterized by necessary and su-cient conditions depending on S and G, which optimizes a bound on the rate of convergence. We provide computational results demonstrating greatly accelerated convergence for this optimizing direction choice and for more easily implemented adaptive heuristic rules.","authors":["David E.
