{"id":"303389899_Artificial_Intelligence_Research_in_India_A_Scientometric_Analysis","abstract":"The present study analyzes the research output of India in the field of artificial intelligence using scientometric analysis techniques. The data were collected manually using the Scopus database at the end of July 2015. Publications in the field of artificial intelligence research in India from 1968 to 2014 were retrieved. It was found that a total of 6,529 papers were published in the field of artificial intelligence in India during that time period. The research output has grown considerably since 2004, and the last 2 years have witnessed a large publications output from the field. The average citation per paper of this data set is 3.06. The average number of authors per paper is three. “Artificial Intelligence” was found to be the most popular keyword, followed by “Algorithms.” A total of 12.64% of the papers have been published with international collaboration. Anna University was found to be the leader in research productivity. It was found that the IITs played a major role in the field of artificial intelligence research in India.","authors":["Rishabh Shrivastava","Preeti Mahajan"],"meta":["May 2016Science & Technology Libraries 35(2)","DOI:10.1080/0194262X.2016.1181023"],"references":["279579019_Informetrics","254754274_Mapping_change_in_scientific_specialties_a_scientometric_case_study_of_the_development_of_artificial_intelligence","242404486_Scientific_Production_in_Computer_Science_Brazil_and_Other_Countries","227316155_The_Literature_of_Bibliometrics_Scientometrics_and_Informetrics","223734533_Neural_networks_in_fisheries_research","221173939_Some_Steps_Towards_a_Scientometric_Analysis_of_Publications_in_Machine_Translation","220365250_Scientometrics_of_computer_science_research_in_India_and_China","220365100_Scientific_production_in_Computer_Science_A_comparative_study_of_Brazil_and_other_countries","220260020_Uncovering_the_Intellectual_Core_of_the_Information_Systems_Discipline","285640443_The_IS_identity_crisis","285452137_The_Value_of_Scientometric_Studies_An_Introduction_to_a_Debate_on_IS_as_a_Reference_Discipline","268844178_Principles_of_expert_systems","239544519_A_Handbook_of_Artificial_Intelligence","234775708_Measurement_of_Science_Study_of_the_Development_of_Science_as_an_Information_Process","222466380_Artificial_intelligence_approaches_to_network_management_Recent_advances_and_a_survey","220433126_Mapping_Change_in_Scientific_Specialties_A_Scientometric_Reconstruction_of_the_Development_of_Artificial_Intelligence","200044349_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","30499698_Kalogirou_SA_Artificial_intelligence_for_the_modeling_and_control_of_combustion_processes_a_review_Prog_Energ_Combust_Sci_29_515-566"]}
