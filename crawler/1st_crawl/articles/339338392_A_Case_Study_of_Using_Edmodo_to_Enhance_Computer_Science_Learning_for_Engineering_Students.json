{"id":"339338392_A_Case_Study_of_Using_Edmodo_to_Enhance_Computer_Science_Learning_for_Engineering_Students","abstract":"Edmodo is becoming increasingly used in higher education. It helps teachers to easily share learning content with students, and communicate with them better. Several studies demonstrate its effectiveness in improving studentsâ€™ results and satisfaction with the learning process. In this paper, we describe our experience using Edmodo for courses in computer sciences designed for engineering students. We tested Edmodo in three courses delivered in a blended learning mode: the assembly language programming, the operating systems, and the PHP language programming. The learning scenario adopted for these courses was already presented in our previous work on the pedagogy of integration. Results show that the use of Edmodo within the pedagogy of integration enhances both learning and teaching experiences.","authors":["Imane Ryane","Nour-eddine El Faddouli"],"meta":["February 2020International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 15(03):62","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v15i03.11252","Project: e-learning"],"references":["326042317_Exploring_the_effectiveness_of_Edmodo_on_Greek_EFL_B1_learners'_motivation_to_write","323165328_Improving_argumentative_writing_Effects_of_a_blended_learning_approach_and_gamification","310506533_Multidisciplinary_methods_in_educational_technology_research_and_development","296703553_Online_collaboration_for_English_learners_Implementing_and_international_project_with_Edmodo","287329867_M-learning_in_Nigerian_higher_education_An_experimental_study_with_Edmodo","275908791_Interactive_Youth_New_Citizenship_between_Social_Networks_and_School_Settings","331395430_First_step_in_implementing_pedagogy_of_integration_using_Edmodo","330339145_Social_Networks_and_Their_Uses_in_the_Field_of_Secondary_Education","320185481_A_Qualitative_Investigation_of_Student_Perceptions_of_Game_Elements_in_a_Gamified_Course","277753519_Stories_Models_and_Examples_from_the_Upcoming_Handbook_of_Blended_Learning_Global_Perspectives_Local_Designs_Part_2"]}
