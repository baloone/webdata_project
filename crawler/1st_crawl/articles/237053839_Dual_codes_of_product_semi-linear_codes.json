{"id":"237053839_Dual_codes_of_product_semi-linear_codes","abstract":"Let F-q be a finite field with q elements and denote by theta : F-q -> F-q an automorphism of F-q. In this paper, we deal with linear codes of F-q(n) invariant under a semi-linear map T : F-q(n) -> F-q(n) for some n >= 2. In particular, we study three kinds of their dual codes, some relations between them and we focus on codes which are products of module skew codes hi the non-commutative polynomial ring as a subcase of linear codes invariant by a semi-linear map T. In this setting we give also an algorithm for encoding, decoding and detecting errors and we show a method to construct codes invariant under a fixed T.","authors":["Luis Felipe Tapia Cuiti√±o","Andrea Tironi"],"meta":["June 2013Linear Algebra and its Applications 457","DOI:10.1016/j.laa.2014.05.011","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257554963_Linear_codes_using_skew_polynomials_with_automorphisms_and_derivations","220963226_A_Note_on_the_Dual_Codes_of_Module_Skew_Codes","29602886_Codes_as_Modules_over_Skew_Polynomial_Rings","3080523_On_the_algebraic_structure_of_quasi-cyclic_codes_I_Finite_fields","266585782_A_class_of_generalized_cyclic_codes","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","257481754_An_elementary_bound_for_the_number_of_points_of_a_hypersurface_over_a_finite_field_Summary","257155579_A_class_of_generalized_cyclic_codes","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","220161158_The_MAGMA_algebra_system_I_the_user_language","7192174_On_Pseudo-Linear_Transformations"]}
