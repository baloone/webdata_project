{"id":"267126485_Reversible_cyclic_codes_over_Z_4","abstract":"In this paper we study reversible cyclic codes of an arbitrary length n over the ring Z 4 . First, we find a set of generators for cyclic codes over Z 4 with no restrictions on the length n. A classification of reversible cyclic codes with respect to their generators follows. We also study the minimum Hamming distance of cyclic codes over Z 4 . Examples of reversible cyclic codes of lenghts 5â€“10 with their minimum Hamming distance are studied as well.","authors":["Taher Abualrub","Irfan Siap"],"meta":["January 2007"],"references":["220247409_Reversible_Codes"]}
