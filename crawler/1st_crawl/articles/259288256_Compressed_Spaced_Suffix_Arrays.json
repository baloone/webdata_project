{"id":"259288256_Compressed_Spaced_Suffix_Arrays","abstract":"Spaced seeds are important tools for similarity search in bioinformatics, and\nusing several seeds together often significantly improves their performance.\nWith existing approaches, however, for each seed we keep a separate linear-size\ndata structure, either a hash table or a spaced suffix array (SSA). In this\npaper we show how to compress SSAs relative to normal suffix arrays (SAs) and\nstill support fast random access to them. We first prove a theoretical upper\nbound on the space needed to store an SSA when we already have the SA. We then\npresent experiments indicating that our approach works even better in practice.","authors":["Travis Gagie","Giovanni Manzini","Daniel Valenzuela"],"meta":["June 2017Mathematics in Computer Science 1146(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11786-016-0283-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280970427_Relative_Compressed_Suffix_Trees","278048399_Relative_Select","262273032_Succinct_de_Bruijn_Graphs","301957619_Relative_FM-Indexes","256744880_Better_spaced_seeds_using_Quadratic_Residues","251696249_On_the_number_of_elements_to_reorder_when_updating_a_suffix_array","227993018_A_Survey_of_Seeding_for_Sequence_Alignment","225918745_Better_Filtering_with_Gapped_q-Grams","222934939_Decomposing_a_Set_of_Points_into_Chains_with_Applications_to_Permutation_and_Circle_Graphs","222402571_Masking_Patterns_in_Sequences_A_New_Class_of_Motif_Discovery_with_Don't_Cares"]}
