{"id":"312120149_FFR_result_post_PCI_is_suboptimal_in_long_diffuse_coronary_artery_disease","abstract":"Aims: \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the functional result immediately post PCI and at nine-month follow-up, and to ascertain how often a functionally optimal result of >0.95 can be achieved in long coronary lesions treated with long second- or newer-generation DES.\n\nMethods and results: \nPatients receiving DES measuring ≥30 mm with FFR value ≤0.8 were included in the study. Stent length was defined as long (30 to 49 mm; L-DES) and ultra-long (≥50 mm; UL-DES). Angiographic and FFR evaluation was performed before and after PCI and at nine-month follow-up. A total of 74 patients each received a mean stent length of 50.72±14.6 mm. Mean FFR post PCI was 0.88±0.06. An optimal post PCI FFR value of >0.95 was achieved in only 9/74 patients (12.2%), and was not achieved in any UL-DES patients. Only 12/74 (16.2%) had FFR post PCI of 0.91 to 0.95; 8/74 (10.8%) patients remained ischaemic (≤0.8). FFR gradient across the stent was higher in UL-DES patients compared to L-DES patients (0.07±0.03 vs. 0.04±0.03; p=0.001). At follow-up, the angiographic restenosis rate was 4.7%, and the functional restenosis rate was 15.1%.\n\nConclusions: \nThe FFR result post PCI was suboptimal in the majority of patients treated with long DES and was particularly poor when the total stent length exceeded 50 mm.","authors":["Arvydas Baranauskas","Aaron J Peace","Aleksandras Kibarskis","Joanne Shannon"],"meta":["December 2016EuroIntervention: journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology 12(12):1473-1480","DOI:10.4244/EIJ-D-15-00514"],"references":["265214582_Fractional_Flow_Reserve-Guided_PCI_for_Stable_Coronary_Artery_Disease","221735885_Lower_risk_of_stent_thrombosis_and_restenosis_with_unrestricted_use_of_'new-generation'_drug-eluting_stents_A_report_from_the_nationwide_Swedish_Coronary_Angiography_and_Angioplasty_Registry_SCAAR","8074656_Fractional_flow_reserve_for_the_prediction_of_cardiac_events_after_coronary_stent_implantation_Results_of_a_multivariate_analysis","298422195_Outcomes_With_Intravascular_Ultrasound-Guided_Stent_Implantation","277133680_Impact_of_ultra-long_second-generation_drug-eluting_stent_implantation_Ultra-Long_Drug-Eluting_Stent_Impact","270968765_Zotarolimus-eluting_durable-polymer-coated_stent_versus_a_biolimus-eluting_biodegradable-polymer-coated_stent_in_unselected_patients_undergoing_percutaneous_coronary_intervention_SORT_OUT_VI_A_randomi","267699783_Prognostic_Value_of_Fractional_Flow_Reserve_Linking_Physiologic_Severity_to_Clinical_Outcomes","260916987_Evolving_concepts_of_angiogram_Fractional_flow_reserve_discordances_in_4000_coronary_stenoses","251720294_Impact_of_Lesion_Length_and_Vessel_Size_on_Clinical_Outcomes_After_Percutaneous_Coronary_Intervention_With_Everolimus-Eluting_Versus_Paclitaxel-Eluting_Stents","233912844_A_prospective_randomized_trial_of_intravascular-ultrasound_guided_compared_to_angiography_guided_stent_implantation_in_complex_coronary_lesions_The_AVIO_trial","51867589_The_impact_of_fractional_flow_reserve_measurement_on_clinical_outcomes_after_transradial_coronary_stenting","49785166_Mechanisms_of_In-Stent_Restenosis_After_Drug-Eluting_Stent_Implantation_Intravascular_Ultrasound_Analysis","44662983_Fractional_Flow_Reserve_Versus_Angiography_for_Guiding_Percutaneous_Coronary_Intervention_in_Patients_With_Multivessel_Coronary_Artery_Disease_2-Year_Follow-Up_of_the_FAME_Fractional_Flow_Reserve_Vers","11648740_Abnormal_Epicardial_Coronary_Resistance_in_Patients_With_Diffuse_Atherosclerosis_but_Normal_Coronary_Angiography","11337106_Coronary_pressure_and_FFR_predict_long-term_outcome_after_PTCA","11293237_Coronary_Pressure_Measurement_After_Stenting_Predicts_Adverse_Events_at_Follow-Up_A_Multicenter_Registry","6961852_Evaluation_of_the_haemodynamic_characteristics_of_drug-eluting_stent_at_implantation_and_at_follow-up","6358798_Clinical_End_Points_in_Coronary_Stent_Trials_A_Case_for_Standardized_Definitions","5421805_Comparison_of_an_Everolimus-Eluting_Stent_and_a_Paclitaxel-Eluting_Stent_in_Patients_With_Coronary_Artery_Disease_A_Randomized_Trial"]}
