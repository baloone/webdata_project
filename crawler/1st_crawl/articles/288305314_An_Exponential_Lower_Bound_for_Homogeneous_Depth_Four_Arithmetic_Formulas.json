{"id":"288305314_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_Homogeneous_Depth_Four_Arithmetic_Formulas","abstract":"We show here a 2ω(log N) size lower bound for homogeneous depth four arithmetic formulas. That is, we give an explicit family of polynomials of degree d on N variables (with N = d3 in our case) with 0, 1-coefficients such that for any representation of a polynomial f in this family of the form f = σi Qij, where the Qij's are homogeneous polynomials (recall that a polynomial is said to be homogeneous if all its monomials have the same degree), it must hold that j (Number of monomials of Qij)) 2ω(log N). The above mentioned family, which we refer to as the Nisan-Wigderson design-based family of polynomials, is in the complexity class VNP. Our work builds on recent lower bound results [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and yields an improved quantitative bound as compared to the quasi-polynomial lower bound from an earlier work of the same authors and the Nω(log log N) lower bound in the independent work of [7].","authors":["Neeraj Kayal","Nutan Limaye","Chandan Saha","Srikanth Srinivasan"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2014.15"],"references":["256003191_Exponential_Complexity_Lower_Bounds_for_Depth_3_Arithmetic_Circuits_in_Algebras_of_Functions_over_Finite_Fields","220365641_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_survey_of_recent_results_and_open_questions","220365637_Partial_Derivatives_in_Arithmetic_Complexity_and_Beyond","51950364_Jacobian_hits_circuits_Hitting-sets_lower_bounds_for_depth-D_occur-kformulas_depth-3_transcendence_degree-k_circuits","3785033_Exponential_complexity_lower_bounds_for_depth_3_arithmetic_circuitsin_algebras_of_functions_over_finite_fields","2241304_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_Depth_3_Arithmetic_Circuits","288310460_Super-polynomial_lower_bounds_for_depth-4_homogeneous_arithmetic_formulas","288149370_A_super-polynomial_lower_bound_for_regular_arithmetic_formulas","282895174_Lower_Bounds_for_Depth-4_Formulas_Computing_Iterated_Matrix_Multiplication","266037398_Stirling's_Approximation_for_n_The_Ultimate_Short_Proof","262329531_A_complexity_theory_based_on_Boolean_algebra","261469588_Approaching_the_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","261054521_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Three","259399872_Superpolynomial_Lower_Bounds_for_General_Homogeneous_Depth_4_Arithmetic_Circuits","258884473_The_Limits_of_Depth_Reduction_for_Arithmetic_Formulas_It's_All_About_the_Top_Fan-In","258699471_Breaking_the_quadratic_barrier_for_3-LCCs_over_the_Reals","236248292_Improved_Bounds_for_Reduction_to_Depth_4_and_Depth_3","234828972_Lower_bounds_for_non-commutative_computation","225806185_Lower_Bounds_and_Separations_for_Constant_Depth_Multilinear_Circuits","224354119_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","221591611_Rank_bounds_for_design_matrices_with_applications_toc_ombinatorial_geometry_and_locally_correctable_codes","221590219_Lower_Bounds_for_Non-Commutative_Computation_Extended_Abstract","220617287_Fast_Parallel_Computation_of_Polynomials_Using_Few_Processors","220358085_Perturbed_Identity_Matrices_Have_High_Rank_Proof_and_Applications","220295480_Separation_of_Multilinear_Circuit_and_Formula_Size","46586684_Rank_Bounds_for_Design_Matrices_with_Applications_to_CombinatorialGeometry_and_Locally_Correctable_Codes","45925555_Arithmetic_circuits_The_chasm_at_depth_four_gets_wider","3505516_On_interpolation_by_analytic_functions_with_special_properties_andsome_weak_lower_bounds_on_the_size_of_circuits_with_symmetric_gates","2893455_Multi-Linear_Formulas_for_Permanent_and_Determinant_Are_of_Super-Polynomial_Size"]}
