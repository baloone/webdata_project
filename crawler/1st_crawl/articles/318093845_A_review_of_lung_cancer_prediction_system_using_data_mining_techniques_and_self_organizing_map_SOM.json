The early detection of cancer can be helpful in curing the disease completely. So the requirement of techniques to detect the occurrence of cancer nodule in early stage is increasing. Earlier diagnosis of Lung Cancer saves enormous lives, failing which may lead to other severe problems causing sudden fatal end. Data mining is a powerful technique to help the people in their health, Scientific and Engineering. Those techniques are extracting the hidden information from the large databases which helps to find the relationships and patterns from the data. This proposal is used to develop a software based Self Organizing Map (SOM) structure which is used to discover the hidden patterns in the lung disorder CT images by using the data mining techniques. This approach starts by extracting the lung regions from the CT image using image processing techniques, including bit Image Slicing, Erosion and Weiner filtering. The bit plane slicing technique is used in the extraction process to convert the CT image into a binary image. Bit plane slicing technique is faster, data and user independent. So many algorithms were developed to detect lung cancer but they are not proved if the in dependent assumptions are taken into consideration. In the era of algorithms used for detecting lung cancer, a Software based SOM structure is not developed. This paper starts with visualizing the closed structure of the Lung regions and then the disorder dataset is process using SOM Toolbox to create a learned SOM using K-means clustering. By using this data mining technique with SOM, it has the advantages of robust to analysis and cost effective method. Data mining technique uses learning method to understand the data patterns. The SOM can be used within the data mining and exploratory data analysis process.","authors":["H. Bharathi","T.S.
