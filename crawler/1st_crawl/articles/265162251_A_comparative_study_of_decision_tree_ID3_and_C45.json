{"id":"265162251_A_comparative_study_of_decision_tree_ID3_and_C45","abstract":"Data mining is the useful tool to discovering the \nknowledge from large data. Different methods & algorithms \nare available in data mining. Classification is most common \nmethod used for finding the mine rule from the large database. \nDecision tree method generally used for the Classification, \nbecause it is the simple hierarchical structure for the user \nunderstanding & decision making. Various data mining \nalgorithms available for classification based on Artificial \nNeural Network, Nearest Neighbour Rule & Baysen classifiers \nbut decision tree mining is simple one. ID3 and C4.5 \nalgorithms have been introduced by J.R Quinlan which produce \nreasonable decision trees. The objective of this paper is to present \nthese algorithms. At first we present the classical algorithm that \nis ID3, then highlights of this study we will discuss in more detail \nC4.5 this one is a natural extension of the ID3 algorithm. And we \nwill make a comparison between these two algorithms and others \nalgorithms such as C5.0 and CART","authors":["Badr Hssina","Abdelkarim MERBOUHA","Hanane Ezzikouri","Mohammed Erritali"],"meta":["July 2014International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications Special Issue on Advances in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networking and Applications(2)","DOI:10.14569/SpecialIssue.2014.040203"],"references":["29467751_Top_10_algorithms_in_data_mining","284082342_Comparison_of_C5_0_CART_classification_algorithms_using_pruning_technique","272910503_A_Comparison_of_Efficiency_and_Robustness_of_ID3_and_C45_Algorithms_Using_Dynamic_Test_and_Training_Data_Sets","228536546_Etudes_des_principaux_algorithmes_de_data_mining","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","30517893_Mesures_de_discrimination_et_leurs_applications_en_apprentissage_inductif"]}
