{"id":"309535473_Membrane_Systems_and_Hypercomputation","abstract":"We present a brief analysis of hypercomputation and its relationship to membrane systems theory, including a re-evaluation of Turing’s analysis of computation and the importance of timing structure, and suggest a ‘cosmological’ variant of tissue P systems that is capable of super-Turing behaviour. No prior technical background in hypercomputation theory is assumed.","authors":["Mike Stannett"],"meta":["January 2013","Conference: International Conference on Membrane ComputingVolume: 7762"],"references":[]}
