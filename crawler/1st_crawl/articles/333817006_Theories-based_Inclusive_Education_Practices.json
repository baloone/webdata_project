{"id":"333817006_Theories-based_Inclusive_Education_Practices","abstract":"This review paper examines the theories of behaviourism, cognitivism, and constructivism that are considered to underpin the theory and practice of inclusive education. We argue that education practices related to the inclusion of students with special educational needs can be derived from each of the three theoretical perspectives. By adopting an eclectic approach to the use of theory-driven inclusive education, we suggest that inclusive education practices best serve the needs of all students, including those with special needs.","authors":["Zaid N.
