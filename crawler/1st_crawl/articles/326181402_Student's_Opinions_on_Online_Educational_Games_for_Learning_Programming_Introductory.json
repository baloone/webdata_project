{"id":"326181402_Student's_Opinions_on_Online_Educational_Games_for_Learning_Programming_Introductory","abstract":"Use of educational games is an approach that has potential to change the existing educational method. This is due to games popularity among younger generation as well as engagement and fun features of games compared to conventional learning method. In addition, games are among the most widespread media amongst younger generation or so-called \"digital natives\" apart from movie, music and internet technology. Game play activities is an important issue to be thoroughly understood due to the facts that many of them are addicted to game play activity. In contrast, conventional learning approaches are not interesting enough to the younger generation. Thus, integration of games technology into education is potentially believed to increase student interest and motivation to learn. This study developed and evaluates an online educational game for learning Programming Introductory course at a university in Malaysia. A total of 180 undergraduate students from computer and engineering background participate in the study. Findings shows that about 80% of students have positive attitude towards the games with around 84% of them find that the games is a fun way to learn, at the same time, an average of 80% agreed that the game provide them with opportunity to learn. Furthermore, about 75% of the students agreed that the game make them able to do self-assessment for Programming course. It was interesting to find that almost 85% of the student said that they will want to use educational games as their future learning approach. Despite many more evidence will be needed especially in Malaysia context, this study is important to rationalize that games can be one of the new learning approaches in the future.","authors":["Roslina Ibrahim","Nor Zairah","Doris Hooi-Ten Wong","Rasimah C.M"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 9(6)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090647"],"references":["325300910_User_Experience_Design_of_History_Game_An_Analysis_Review_and_Evaluation_Study_for_Malaysia_Context","320015680_Student_acceptance_of_educational_games_in_higher_education","319051984_PDEduGame_Towards_participatory_design_process_for_educational_game_design_in_primary_school","286573155_An_Overview_of_Serious_Games","267255295_A_Cognitive_Ergonomics_Approach_to_the_Process_of_Game_Design_and_Development","225215352_Applying_Pedagogy_during_Game_Development_to_Enhance_Game-Based_Learning","222835801_Beyond_Nintendo_Design_and_assessment_of_educational_video_games_for_first_and_second_grade_students","222668228_EGameFlow_A_scale_to_measure_learners'_enjoyment_of_e-learning_games","220259897_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Toward_a_Unified_View","49594530_Students_Perceptions_of_Using_Educational_Games_to_Learn_Introductory_Programming","35194740_Is_it_all_in_the_game_learner_support_in_an_educational_knowledge_management_simulation_game","32231341_Literature_Review_in_Games_and_Learning","4376212_Game_based_learning_model_for_history_courseware_A_preliminary_analysis","318916577_Finding_the_Right_Elements_User_Experience_Elements_for_Educational_Games","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","305761618_Extending_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior_TPB_to_Explain_Online_Game_Playing_among_Malaysian_Undergraduate_Students","285637737_Good_video_games_and_good_learning","285189428_Games_and_learning","263464369_User_acceptance_of_information_technology_System_characteristics_user_perceptions_and_behavioral_impacts","259514429_Critic-proofing_of_the_cognitive_aspects_of_simple_games","252054042_A_process_of_educational_game_design_based_on_EFM_model","238374519_What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy","233940546_Selling_points_What_cognitive_abilities_are_tapped_by_casual_video_games","223896928_Computer_games_development_and_appreciative_learning_approach_in_enhancing_students'_creative_perception","222942810_Consumer_behavior_in_online_game_communities_A_motivational_factor_perspective","222125621_Determinants_of_adoption_of_mobile_games_under_mobile_broadband_wireless_access_environment","221238411_Investigating_the_educational_effectiveness_of_multiplayer_online_games_for_children","221038795_Understanding_Malaysian_students_as_gamers_Experience","220495207_Why_Do_People_Play_Social_Network_Games","220374354_Effect_of_Computer-Based_Video_Games_on_Children_An_Experimental_Study","220139799_Students'_perceptions_about_the_use_of_video_games_in_the_classroom","220139654_Form_one_students'_engagement_with_computer_games_and_its_effect_on_their_academic_achievement_in_a_Malaysian_secondary_school","30874037_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","6824898_Games_that_work_Using_computer_games_to_teach_alcohol-affected_children_about_fire_and_street_safety","4376189_Digital_games-based_learning_for_children","4141359_An_integrated_course_based_on_educational_games"]}
