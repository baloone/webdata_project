{"id":"258397066_Numerical_Solution_of_Duffing_Equation_by_Using_an_Improved_Taylor_Matrix_Method","abstract":"We have suggested a numerical approach, which is based on an improved Taylor matrix method, for solving Duffing differential equations. The method is based on the approximation by the truncated Taylor series about center zero. Duffing equation and conditions are transformed into the matrix equations, which corresponds to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations with the unknown coefficients, via collocation points. Combining these matrix equations and then solving the system yield the unknown coefficients of the solution function. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity and the applicability of the technique. The results show the efficiency and the accuracy of the present work. Also, the method can be easily applied to engineering and science problems.","authors":["Berna Bülbül","Mehmet Sezer"],"meta":["January 2013Journal of Applied Mathematics 2013(4)","DOI:10.1155/2013/691614"],"references":["272899265_Dynamic_Analysis_of_Nonlinear_Oscillator_Equation_Arising_in_Double-Sided_Driven_Clamped_Microbeam-Based_Electromechanical_Resonator","269745886_A_New_Approach_to_Van_der_Pols_Oscillator_Problem","266492501_Approximate_Analytical_Solutions_to_Nonlinear_Oscillators_Using_He's_Amplitude-Frequency_Formulation","266188302_On_the_numerical_verification_of_the_asymptotic_expansion_of_Duffing's_equation","265709032_Chaos_in_the_Duffing_Equation","257631916_Application_of_energy_balance_method_and_variational_iteration_method_to_an_oscillation_of_a_mass_attached_to_a_stretched_elastic_wire","257451367_Coupling_of_homotopy_and_the_variational_approach_for_a_conservative_oscillator_with_strong_odd-nonlinearity","257328532_Numerical_modelling_of_an_iron_pendulum_in_a_magnetic_field","248744187_Existence_of_periodic_solutions_of_Duffing_equations","245185219_CHAOS_and_limit_cycle_in_Duffing's_equation"]}
