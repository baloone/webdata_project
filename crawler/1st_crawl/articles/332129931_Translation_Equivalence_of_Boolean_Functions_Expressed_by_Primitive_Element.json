{"id":"332129931_Translation_Equivalence_of_Boolean_Functions_Expressed_by_Primitive_Element","abstract":"In recent years, algebraic attacks and fast algebraic attacks have received a lot of attention in the cryptographic community. There are three Boolean functions achieving optimal algebraic immunity based on primitive element of F 2 n. The support of Boolean functions in [1]–[3] have the same parameter s, which makes us have a large number of Boolean functions with good properties. However, we prove that the Boolean functions are affine equivalence when s takes different values.
