{"id":"259010359_Online_Algorithms_with_Advice_for_Bin_Packing_and_Scheduling_Problems","abstract":"We consider the setting of online computation with advice, and study the bin\npacking problem and a number of scheduling problems. We show that it is\npossible, for any of these problems, to arbitrarily approach a competitive\nratio of $1$ with only a constant number of bits of advice per request. For the\nbin packing problem, we give an online algorithm with advice that is\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-competitive and uses $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\right)$ bits of advice per request. For scheduling on\n$m$ identical machines, with the objective function of any of makespan, machine\ncovering and the minimization of the $\\ell_p$ norm, $p >1$, we give similar\nresults. We give online algorithms with advice which are\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-competitive ($(1/(1-\\varepsilon))$-competitive for machine\ncovering) and also use $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\n\\right)$ bits of advice per request. We complement our results by giving a\nlower bound showing that for any online algorithm with advice to be optimal,\nfor any of the above scheduling problems, a non-constant number (namely, at\nleast $\\left(1 - \\frac{2m}{n}\\right)\\log m$, where $n$ is the number of jobs\nand $m$ is the number of machines) of bits of advice per request is needed.","authors":["Marc P Renault","Adi Ros√©n","Rob van Stee"],"meta":["November 2013Theoretical Computer Science 600","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2015.07.050","SourcearXiv"],"references":["233923199_Online_Bin_Packing_with_Advice","231520878_On_Online_Algorithms_with_Advice_for_the_k-Server_Problem","226657157_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_Online_Problems","225368160_Ancient_and_New_Algorithms_for_Load_Balancing_in_the_lp_Norm","4355086_Using_dual_approximation_algorithms_for_scheduling_problems_Theoretical_and_practical_results","314721199_On_randomized_online_scheduling","267783122_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_Knapsack_Problem","266063817_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_Buffer_Management","260008380_The_online_knapsack_problem_Advice_and_randomization","244416507_A_polynomial-time_approximation_scheme_for_maximizing_the_minimum_machine_completion_time","237107187_Near-Optimal_Bin_Packing_Algorithms","236661740_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_k-server_Problem_Under_Sparse_Metrics","225492195_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_k-Server_Problem","225108118_Bin_packing_can_be_solved_within_1_in_linear_time","223659828_Lower_bounds_for_randomized_online_scheduling","222461362_A_lower_bound_for_randomized_on-line_multiprocessor_scheduling","221591749_On_randomized_online_scheduling","221513077_Advice_Complexity_and_Barely_Random_Algorithms","221428744_New_Lower_Bounds_for_Certain_Classes_of_Bin_Packing_Algorithms","220898782_Online_Computation_with_Advice","220689517_Online_Computation_and_Competitive_Analyses","220617389_Improved_Bounds_for_the_Online_Scheduling_Problem","220555862_A_Survey_of_Performance_Measures_for_On-line_Algorithms","220441609_Bin_packing_can_be_solved_within_1epsilon_in_linear_time","220110578_Does_Randomization_Help_in_On-Line_Bin_Packing","2503856_On-Line_Machine_Covering","2441741_On_the_Online_Bin_Packing_Problem","2314243_Approximation_Schemes_for_Scheduling","2238793_Online_Scheduling_Revisited"]}
