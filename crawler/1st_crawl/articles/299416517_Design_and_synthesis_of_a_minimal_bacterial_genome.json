{"id":"299416517_Design_and_synthesis_of_a_minimal_bacterial_genome","abstract":"We used whole-genome design and complete chemical synthesis to minimize the 1079â€“kilobase pair synthetic genome of Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0. An initial design, based on collective knowledge of molecular biology combined with limited transposon mutagenesis data, failed to produce a viable cell. Improved transposon mutagenesis methods revealed a class of quasi-essential genes that are needed for robust growth, explaining the failure of our initial design. Three cycles of design, synthesis, and testing, with retention of quasi-essential genes, produced JCVI-syn3.0 (531 kilobase pairs, 473 genes), which has a genome smaller than that of any autonomously replicating cell found in nature. JCVI-syn3.0 retains almost all genes involved in the synthesis and processing of macromolecules. Unexpectedly, it also contains 149 genes with unknown biological functions. JCVI-syn3.0 is a versatile platform for investigating the core functions of life and for exploring whole-genome design.","authors":["Hutchison, C.A., III","Ray Chuang","Vladimir N Noskov","Nacyra Assad-Garcia"],"meta":["March 2016Science 351(6280):aad6253-aad6253","DOI:10.1126/science.aad6253"],"references":["273638616_Recombinase-mediated_cassette_exchange_RMCE_system_for_functional_genomics_studies_in_Mycoplasma_mycoides","272080125_Bacterial_genome_reduction_using_the_progressive_clustering_of_deletions_via_yeast_sexual_cycling","271199829_Defining_a_minimal_cell_Essentiality_of_small_ORFs_and_ncRNAs_in_a_genome-reduced_bacterium","270002958_TREC-IN_Gene_knock-in_genetic_tool_for_genomes_cloned_in_yeast","265335157_Systems_Biology_Perspectives_on_Minimal_and_Simpler_Cells","264633923_Rescue_of_mutant_fitness_defects_using_in_vitro_reconstituted_designer_transposons_in_Mycoplasma_mycoides","264500972_Bacillus_subtilis_and_Escherichia_coli_essential_genes_and_minimal_cell_factories_after_one_decade_of_genome_engineering","281684237_Galactofuranose_in_Mycoplasma_mycoides_is_important_for_membrane_integrity_and_conceals_adhesins_but_does_not_contribute_to_serum_resistance","279033611_Functional_optimization_of_gene_clusters_by_combinatorial_design_and_assembly","275898107_The_essential_role_of_SepF_in_mycobacterial_division_Essential_role_of_SepF_in_mycobacterial_division"]}
