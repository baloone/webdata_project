{"id":"287853928_Classification_of_weighted_networks_through_mesoscale_homological_features","abstract":"As complex networks find applications in a growing range of disciplines, the\ndiversity of naturally occurring and model networks being studied is exploding.\nThe adoption of a well-developed collection of network taxonomies is a natural\nmethod for both organizing this data and understanding deeper relationships\nbetween networks. Most existing metrics for network structure rely on classical\ngraph-theoretic measures, extracting characteristics primarily related to\nindividual vertices or paths between them, and thus classify networks from the\nperspective of local features. Here, we describe an alternative approach to\nstudying structure in networks that relies on an algebraic-topological metric\ncalled persistent homology, which studies intrinsically mesoscale structures\ncalled cycles, constructed from cliques in the network. We present a\nclassification of 14 commonly studied weighted network models into four groups\nor classes, and discuss the structural themes arising in each class. Finally,\nwe compute the persistent homology of two real-world networks and one network\nconstructed by a common dynamical systems model, and we compare the results\nwith the three classes to obtain a better understanding of those networks","authors":["Ann Sizemore","Chad Giusti","Danielle S.
