{"id":"221355576_Cryptanalysis_Based_on_2-Adic_Rational_Approximation","abstract":"This paper presents a new algorithm for cryptanalytically attacking stream ciphers. There is an associated measure of security,\nthe 2-adic span. In order for a stream cipher to be secure, its 2-adic span must be large. This attack exposes a weakness of Rueppel and\nMassey’s summation combiner. The algorithm, based on De Weger and Mahler’s rational approximation theory for 2-adic numbers,\nsynthesizes a shortest feedback with carry shift register that outputs a particular key stream, given a small number of bits of the key stream. It is adaptive in that it does not\nneed to know the number of available bits beforehand.","authors":["Andrew Klapper","Mark Goresky"],"meta":["August 1995","DOI:10.1007/3-540-44750-4_21","SourceDBLP","Conference: Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO '95, 15th Annual International Cryptology Conference, Santa Barbara, California, USA, August 27-31, 1995, Proceedings"],"references":["242151583_Feedback_registers_based_on_ramified_extensions_of_the_2-adic_numbers","303492589_The_fast_fourier_transform_in_a_finite_field","268730311_Continued_Fractions_and_Linear_Recurrences","268493826_p-adic_Numbers_p-adic_Analysis_and_Zeta-Functions","268243161_On_a_geometrical_representation_of_p-adic_numbers","248506897_Feedback_Shift_Registers_combiners_with_memory_and_2_-_adic_span","247878188_The_Fast_Fourier_Transform_in_a_Finite_Field","234781753_Analysis_and_Design_of_Stream_Ciphers","227302813_Schnelle_Multiplikation_grosser_Zahlen","226173374_Shamir_A_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES-like_Cryptosystems_Journal_of_Cryptology_41_3-72","220942577_Feedback_with_Carry_Shift_Registers_over_Finite_Fields_extended_abstract","222455494_Approximation_lattices_of_p-adic_numbers","221355555_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES-like_Cryptosystems","221327262_Continued_Fractions_and_the_Berlekamp-Massey_Algorithm","220689860_Methods_and_Applications_of_Error-Free_Computation"]}
