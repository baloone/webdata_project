{"id":"324752301_COMPOSER_A_compact_open-source_service_platform","abstract":"Compute and network virtualization enable to deliver network services with unprecedented agility and flexibility based on a) the programmatic placement of service functions across the available infrastructure and b) the real-time setup of the corresponding network paths. This paper presents and validates COMPOSER, a compact, flexible and high-performance service platform for the deployment of network services. COMPOSER supports multiple virtualization engines (e.g., virtual machines, containers, native network functions) and it can use seamlessly the above different execution environments to instantiate network services belonging to different chains, hence facilitating domain-oriented orchestration and enabling the joint optimization of compute and network resources. We demonstrate that COMPOSER can run on resource-constrained hardware, such as residential gateways, as well as on high-performance servers. Finally, COMPOSER integrates optimized data plane components that enable our platform to reach top-class results with respect to data plane performance as well.","authors":["Ivano Cerrato","Fulvio Risso","Roberto Bonafiglia","Kostas Pentikousis"],"meta":["April 2018Computer Networks 139","DOI:10.1016/j.comnet.2018.04.012"],"references":[]}
