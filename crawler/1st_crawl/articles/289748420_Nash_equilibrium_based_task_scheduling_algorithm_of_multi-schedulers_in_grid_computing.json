{"id":"289748420_Nash_equilibrium_based_task_scheduling_algorithm_of_multi-schedulers_in_grid_computing","abstract":"At present, grid task scheduling Algorithms focus on 1 × n type grid, namely one scheduler and n resources but neglect m × n type grid. We built a Grid model of m × n type grid using M/M/1 queue system, and promoted the concept of task scheduling Nash equilibrium among multi-schedulers. The optimal objective of each scheduler is mean complete time per task. The Nash equilibrium took advantage of PSO to be solved. By simulations, we conclude that the new algorithm is better than the algorithm based on the mean scheduling strategies in mean finished task numbers per time, mean load of network and mean load of Grid resources.","authors":["K.
