{"id":"319897771_Geometry_Helps_to_Compare_Persistence_Diagrams","abstract":"Exploiting geometric structure to improve the asymptotic complexity of discrete assignment problems is a well-studied subject. In contrast, the practical advantages of using geometry for such problems have not been explored. We implement geometric variants of the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for bottleneck matching (based on previous work by Efrat el al.) and of the auction algorithm by Bertsekas for Wasserstein distance computation. Both implementations use k-d trees to replace a linear scan with a geometric proximity query. Our interest in this problem stems from the desire to compute distances between persistence diagrams, a problem that comes up frequently in topological data analysis. We show that our geometric matching algorithms lead to a substantial performance gain, both in running time and in memory consumption, over their purely combinatorial counterparts. Moreover, our implementation significantly outperforms the only other implementation available for comparing persistence diagrams.","authors":["Michael Kerber","Dmitriy Morozov","Arnur Nigmetov"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Experimental Algorithmics 22(1):1-20","DOI:10.1145/3064175"],"references":["226216274_Geometry_Helps_in_Bottleneck_Matching_and_Related_Problems","225527668_The_auction_algorithm_A_distributed_relaxation_method_for_the_assignment_problem","225431349_The_auction_algorithm_for_the_transportation_problem","225338121_Lipschitz_Functions_Have_Lp-Stable_Persistence","220983814_Stability_of_Persistence_Diagrams","220779835_Algorithms_for_the_Transportation_Problem_in_Geometric_Settings","220692408_Computational_Topology_An_Introduction","2562189_Topological_Persistence_and_Simplification","301269494_Geometry_Helps_to_Compare_Persistence_Diagrams","300356475_Topology-Driven_Trajectory_Synthesis_with_an_Example_on_Retinal_Cell_Motions","287702614_Approximation_algorithms_for_bipartite_matching_with_metric_and_geometric_costs","283559921_Paths_trees_flowers","278996963_GEOMETRY_HELPS_IN_MATCHING","265426020_Algorithms_for_the_Assignment_and_Transportation_Problems","259389412_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_And_Applications","242600743_An_n2_algorithm_for_maximum_matching_in_bipartite_graphs","231537609_Classification_of_Hepatic_Lesions_using_the_Matching_Metric","226626699_A_New_Algorithm_for_the_Assignment_Problem","223275435_Exploring_uses_of_persistent_homology_for_statistical_analysis_of_landmark-based_shape_data","222440575_Parallel_synchronous_and_asynchronous_implementations_of_the_auction_algorithm","221499497_An_N52_Algorithm_for_Maximum_Matching_in_Bipartite_Graphs","221209509_Improvements_on_Geometric_Pattern_Matching_Problems","220991238_On_Bipartite_Matching_under_the_RMS_Distance","220693673_Assignment_Problems","220424200_Multidimensional_Binary_Search_Trees_Used_for_Associative_Searching_Communications_of_the_ACM_189_509-517","30867879_Multidimensional_Binary_Search_Trees_Used_for_Associative_Searching","3880893_Topological_persistence_and_simplification","2711281_ANN_A_Library_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Searching"]}
