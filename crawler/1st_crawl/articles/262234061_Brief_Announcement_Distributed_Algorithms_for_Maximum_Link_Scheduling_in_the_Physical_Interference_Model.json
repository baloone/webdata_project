{"id":"262234061_Brief_Announcement_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Link_Scheduling_in_the_Physical_Interference_Model","abstract":"We develop distributed algorithms for the maximum independent link set problem in wireless networks in a distributed computing model based on the physical interference model with SINR constraints -- this is more realistic and more challenging than the traditional graph-based models. Our results give the first distributed algorithm for this problem with polylogarithmic running time with a constant factor approximation guarantee, matching the sequential bound.","authors":["Guanhong Pei","Anil Kumar S Vullikanti"],"meta":["October 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-33651-5_31","Conference: Proceedings of the 26th international conference on Distributed Computing"],"references":["224500426_Capacity_of_Arbitrary_Wireless_Networks","224243973_On_a_game_theoretic_approach_to_capacity_maximization_in_wireless_networks","221628472_Complexity_in_geometric_SINR","45933895_On_a_game_theoretic_approach_to_capacity_maximization_in_wireless_networks","267804376_Distributed_Link_Scheduling_under_the_Physical_Interference_Model","230609115_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Link_Scheduling_in_DistributedComputing_Models_with_SINR_Constraints","220799050_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Links_under_Physical_Interference_Model"]}
