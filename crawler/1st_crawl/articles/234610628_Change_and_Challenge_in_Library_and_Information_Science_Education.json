{"id":"234610628_Change_and_Challenge_in_Library_and_Information_Science_Education","abstract":"This book assesses the role of library and information science education in the American university against a broad background of the issues faced by professional schools and the field in general. The book is based in part on information provided by eight accredited schools of library and information science. The issues covered include: (1) what constitutes professional work; (2) regional and national planning for library and information science education versus decision-making by local institutions; (3) the accommodation of specialization; (4) field support for schools that will provide a research and knowledge base; (5) and the emergence of the discipline's integrity in a time of rapid change. Individual chapters present a historical overview and discuss the aims of professional education, the professional context, the university setting, faculty, curriculum, students, administration, and accreditation.
