{"id":"334122955_False_News_On_Social_Media_A_Data-Driven_Survey","abstract":"In the past few years, the research community has dedicated growing interest to the issue of false news circulating on social networks. The widespread attention on detecting and characterizing deceptive information has been motivated by considerable political and social backlashes in the real world. As a matter of fact, social media platforms exhibit peculiar characteristics, with respect to traditional news outlets, which have been particularly favorable to the proliferation of false news. They also present unique challenges for all kind of potential interventions on the subject.\nAs this issue becomes of global concern, it is also gaining more attention in academia. The aim of this survey is to offer a comprehensive study on the recent advances in terms of detection, characterization and mitigation of false news that propagate on social media, as well as the challenges and the open questions that await future research on the field. We use a data-driven approach, focusing on a classification of the features that are used in each study to characterize false information and on the datasets used for instructing classification methods. At the end of the survey, we highlight emerging approaches that look most promising for addressing false news.","authors":["Francesco Pierri","Stefano Ceri"],"meta":["June 2019ACM SIGMOD Record 48(2):18-32","DOI:10.1145/3377330.3377334","Project: Characterization, Detection and Resolution of Disinformation on Social Media"],"references":["335481117_Unsupervised_Fake_News_Detection_on_Social_Media_A_Generative_Approach","331929395_The_spreading_of_misinformation_online","329590584_Early_Detection_of_Fake_News_on_Social_Media_Through_Propagation_Path_Classification_with_Recurrent_and_Convolutional_Networks","329218472_The_spread_of_low-credibility_content_by_social_bots","328650077_Unsupervised_Fake_News_Detection_on_Social_Media_A_Generative_Approach","328432132_Beyond_News_Content_The_Role_of_Social_Context_for_Fake_News_Detection","326500043_EANN_Event_Adversarial_Neural_Networks_for_Multi-Modal_Fake_News_Detection","324833393_The_Rise_of_Guardians_Fact-checking_URL_Recommendation_to_Combat_Fake_News","324717175_False_Information_on_Web_and_Social_Media_A_Survey","323650280_The_science_of_fake_news","323387293_Unsupervised_Content-Based_Identification_of_Fake_News_Articles_with_Tensor_Decomposition_Ensembles","322794598_SemEval-2017_Task_8_RumourEval_Determining_rumour_veracity_and_support_for_rumours","322592043_Anatomy_of_an_online_misinformation_network","321485003_Tracing_Fake-News_Footprints_Characterizing_Social_Media_Messages_by_How_They_Propagate","318981549_Fake_News_Detection_on_Social_Media_A_Data_Mining_Perspective","318741689_Separating_Facts_from_Fiction_Linguistic_Models_to_Classify_Suspicious_and_Trusted_News_Posts_on_Twitter","318471348_Setting_the_agenda_The_mass_media_and_public_opinion","318360315_A_simple_but_tough-to-beat_baseline_for_the_Fake_News_Challenge_stance_detection_task","317612664_The_agenda-setting_power_of_fake_news_A_big_data_analysis_of_the_online_media_landscape_from_2014_to_2016","316471370_Some_Like_it_Hoax_Automated_Fake_News_Detection_in_Social_Networks","316283346_SemEval-2017_Task_8_RumourEval_Determining_rumour_veracity_and_support_for_rumours","315766818_Detection_and_Resolution_of_Rumours_in_Social_Media_A_Survey","315682536_This_Just_In_Fake_News_Packs_a_Lot_in_Title_Uses_Simpler_Repetitive_Content_in_Text_Body_More_Similar_to_Satire_than_Real_News","313861498_A_Stylometric_Inquiry_into_Hyperpartisan_and_Fake_News","312635179_BotOrNot_A_System_to_Evaluate_Social_Bots","303609801_Social_Identity_Theory_and_the_Organization","303545807_Emergent_a_novel_data-set_for_stance_classification","303015763_Detecting_Rumors_from_Microblogs_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","301841797_Hoaxy_A_Platform_for_Tracking_Online_Misinformation","301650504_Fake_News_or_Truth_Using_Satirical_Cues_to_Detect_Potentially_Misleading_News","299943097_Disinformation_on_the_Web_Impact_Characteristics_and_Detection_of_Wikipedia_Hoaxes","289263634_The_spreading_of_misinformation_online","335517139_Automatic_Detection_of_Fake_News","334115090_DeClarE_Debunking_Fake_News_and_False_Claims_using_Evidence-Aware_Deep_Learning","334115084_A_Stylometric_Inquiry_into_Hyperpartisan_and_Fake_News","324640336_Online_Misinformation_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","324640030_Fake_News_Detection_in_Social_Networks_via_Crowd_Signals","324635281_Misleading_or_Falsification_Inferring_Deceptive_Strategies_and_Types_in_Online_News_and_Social_Media","323649207_The_spread_of_true_and_false_news_online","322971572_Leveraging_the_Crowd_to_Detect_and_Reduce_the_Spread_of_Fake_News_and_Misinformation","320885186_CSI_A_Hybrid_Deep_Model_for_Fake_News_Detection","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","318740546_Liar_Liar_Pants_on_Fire_A_New_Benchmark_Dataset_for_Fake_News_Detection","318471345_Setting_the_agenda_The_mass_media_and_public_opinion","318122260_Disinformation_and_Social_Bot_Operations_in_the_Run_Up_to_the_2017_French_Presidential_Election","316712634_Social_Media_and_Fake_News_in_the_2016_Election","316643096_Liar_Liar_Pants_on_Fire_A_New_Benchmark_Dataset_for_Fake_News_Detection","308565786_Deception_detection_for_news_Three_types_of_fakes","304225776_Bots_StrongerIn_and_Brexit_Computational_Propaganda_during_the_UK-EU_Referendum","288451483_On_rumors_How_falsehoods_spread_why_we_believe_them_and_what_can_be_done","282124505_The_Development_and_Psychometric_Properties_of_LIWC2015","281818865_Automatic_Deception_Detection_Methods_for_Finding_Fake_News","281818851_Deception_Detection_for_News_Three_Types_of_Fakes","285797288_Effects_of_group_pressure_on_modification_and_distortion_of_judgments","285722570_Elaboration_likelihood_model"]}
