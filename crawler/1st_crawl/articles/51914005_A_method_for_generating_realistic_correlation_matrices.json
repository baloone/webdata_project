{"id":"51914005_A_method_for_generating_realistic_correlation_matrices","abstract":"Simulating sample correlation matrices is important in many areas of\nstatistics. Approaches such as generating Gaussian data and finding their\nsample correlation matrix or generating random uniform $[-1,1]$ deviates as\npairwise correlations both have drawbacks. We develop an algorithm for adding\nnoise, in a highly controlled manner, to general correlation matrices. In many\ninstances, our method yields results which are superior to those obtained by\nsimply simulating Gaussian data. Moreover, we demonstrate how our general\nalgorithm can be tailored to a number of different correlation models. Using\nour results with a few different applications, we show that simulating\ncorrelation matrices can help assess statistical methodology.","authors":["Johanna Hardin","Stephan Ramon Garcia","David Golan"],"meta":["June 2011The Annals of Applied Statistics 7(3)","DOI:10.1214/13-AOAS638","SourcearXiv"],"references":["312656365_Microarray_data_analysis_From_disarray_to_consolidation_and_consensus","309532407_WGCNA_an_R_package_for_weighted_correlation_network_analysis","272860727_Matrix_Analysis","272176868_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","269947786_Taxonomy_and_Behavioral_Science-Comparative_Performance_of_Grouping_Methods","267962334_Inner_product_of_random_vectors","265703154_On_Random_Correlation_Matrices","260869480_The_Use_of_Multiple_Measurements_in_Taxonomic_Problems","250956336_Generating_Correlation_Matrices","250185735_Combining_Correlation_Matrices_Simulation_Analysis_of_Improved_Fixed-Effects_Methods"]}
