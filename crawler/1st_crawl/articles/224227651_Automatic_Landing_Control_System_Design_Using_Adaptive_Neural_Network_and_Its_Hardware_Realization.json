{"id":"224227651_Automatic_Landing_Control_System_Design_Using_Adaptive_Neural_Network_and_Its_Hardware_Realization","abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive neural network, designed to improve the performance of conventional automatic landing systems (ALS). Real-time learning was applied to train the neural network using the gradient-descent of an error function to adaptively update weights. Adaptive learning rates were obtained through the analysis of Lyapunov stability to guarantee the convergence of learning. In addition, we applied a DSP controller using the VisSim/TI C2000 Rapid Prototyper to develop an embedded control system and establish on-line real-time control. Simulations show that the proposed control scheme has superior performance to conventional ALS under conditions of wind disturbance of up to 75 ft/s.","authors":["Jih-Gau Juang","Li-Hsiang Chien","Felix Lin"],"meta":["July 2011IEEE Systems Journal 5(2):266 - 277","DOI:10.1109/JSYST.2011.2134490","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["243689579_A_Resource-Allocating_Network_for_Function_Interpolation","220176417_Application_of_generalised_neural_network_for_aircraft_landing_control_system","5614015_An_adaptive_resource-allocating_network_for_automated_detection_segmentation_and_classification_of_breast_cancer_nuclei_topic_area_Image_processing_and_recognition","4029542_Optimal_neuro-controller_in_longitudinal_auto-landing_of_a_commercial_jet_transport","3508295_Learning_control_using_neural_networks","3335895_Identification_and_Control_of_Dynamic_Systems_Using_Recurrent_Fuzzy_Neural_Networks","2274695_Prediction_of_Chaotic_Time-Series_with_a_Resource-Allocating_RBF_Network","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","298573933_Intelligent_automatic_landing_system_using_time_delay_neural_network_controller","265440640_Stability_of_motion_Applications_of_Lyapunov's_second_method_to_differential_systems_and_equations_with_delay_Translated_by_JL_Brenner","265365627_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Stability","262249372_A_neural_network_baseline_problem_for_control_of_aircraft_flare_and_touchdown","246203193_Flight_Stability_and_Automatic_Control","245432848_Automatic_Landing_System_Design_Using_Fuzzy_Logic","245096185_Tool_wear_estimation_using_resource_allocation_network","224982370_Neural_Networks_-_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","224761059_Adaptive_Instrument_Landing_System_in_Future_Air_Traffic_Control","224703925_A_Look_at_the_Future_of_Automatic_Landing_Systems","224107119_Hardware_in_loop_implementation_and_analysis_of_a_neural_augmented_fault_tolerant_flight_controller_for_a_high_performance_dynamic_fighter_aircraft_model_on_a_target_digital_signal_processor","223341010_A_direct_adaptive_neural_command_controller_design_for_an_unstable_helicopter","222632934_A_Model_Reference_Control_Structure_Using_a_Fuzzy_Neural_Network","222174020_Resource_allocation_neural_network_in_portfolio_selection","221163332_Using_Unscented_Kalman_Filter_for_Training_the_Minimal_Resource_Allocation_Neural_Network","220906077_The_Fuzzy_Model_for_Aircraft_Landing_Control","220356160_Intelligent_Automatic_Landing_System_Using_Time_Delay_Neural_Network_Controller","220109325_Application_of_Neural_Networks_to_Disturbances_Encountered_Landing_Control","23575597_Optimal_penetration_landing_trajectories_in_the_presence_of_windshear","7941069_Intelligent_initialization_of_resource_allocating_RBF_networks","3301901_Diagonal_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Dynamic_System_Control","3002946_An_intelligent_landing_system_based_on_a_human_skill_model"]}
