{"id":"332433497_A_review_of_performance_of_zero_energy_buildings_and_energy_efficiency_solutions","abstract":"The enhancement of energy performance of buildings has become a pillar of energy policies. The main target is the cut of energy consumption to reduce buildings footprint. This aim is pursued by introducing constrains on building requirements in terms of properties of basic materials and components and exploitation of renewable energy sources. That results in the definition of the zero-energy building (ZEB) concept. The new paradigm introduced new challenges and, at the same time, involved all the different stakeholders in facing the barriers to the diffusion of the novel solutions proposed by the research development.\nThis paper summarizes the actual state-of-art of whole performance of ZEBs and the related technical solutions, analysing their increasing potential in energy consumption. A collection of the different case studies reported in literature involving ZEBs is presented, compiling an analysis of the performance of the common solutions actually applied. The technologies involved are described discussing their impact in meeting the ZEB requirements. A debate is proposed, pointing out the main aspects deserving further investigations and outlining the critical elements in making the zero-energy target the new standard for the buildings.","authors":["Lorenzo Belussi","Benedetta Barozzi","Alice Bellazzi","Ludovico Danza"],"meta":["April 2019Journal of Building Engineering 25","DOI:10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100772","Project: Zero
