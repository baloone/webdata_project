{"id":"320589290_Prevalence_and_Recoverability_of_Syntactic_Parameters_in_Sparse_Distributed_Memories","abstract":"We propose a new method, based on sparse distributed memory, for studying dependence relations between syntactic parameters in the Principles and Parameters model of Syntax. By storing data of syntactic structures of world languages in a Kanerva network and checking recoverability of corrupted data from the network, we identify two different effects: an overall underlying relation between the prevalence of parameters across languages and their degree of recoverability, and a finer effect that makes some parameters more easily recoverable beyond what their prevalence would indicate. The latter can be seen as an indication of the existence of dependence relations, through which a given parameter can be determined using the remaining uncorrupted data.","authors":["Jeong Joon Park","Ronnel Boettcher","Andrew Zhao","Alex Mun"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-68445-1_31","Conference: International Conference on Geometric Science of Information"],"references":["308807290_Syntactic_Structures_and_Code_Parameters","299999008_Syntactic_Parameters_and_a_Coding_Theory_Perspective_on_Entropy_and_Complexity_of_Language_Families","40853561_Parametric_versus_functional_explanations_of_syntactic_universals","38112825_Memory_Capacities_for_Synaptic_and_Structural_Plasticity","5284369_The_Emergence_of_Language","3303907_Sparse_Distributed_Memory_Using_Rank-Order_Neural_Codes","325387496_Syntactic_Phylogenetic_Trees","319394257_Syntax_An_International_Handbook_of_Contemporary_Research","305186150_Syntactic_Phylogenetic_Trees","280695756_Spin_Glass_Models_of_Syntax_and_Language_Evolution","247784878_The_Atoms_of_Language","246061558_Encoding_Structure_in_Boolean_Space","244445519_The_Theory_of_Principles_and_Parameters","225109955_Neural_Network_Models_for_Language_Acquisition_A_Brief_Survey","220531699_The_Cross-Linguistic_Prevalence_of_SOV_and_SVO_Word_Orders_Reflects_the_Sequential_and_Hierarchical_Representation_of_Action_in_Broca's_Area","24301472_Sparse_Distributed_Memory_and_Related_Models","24293455_Capacity_for_patterns_and_sequences_in_Kanerva's_SDM_as_compared_to_other_associative_memory_models","23702642_Sparse_Distributed_Memory","10688003_Does_Broca's_play_by_the_rules","5595879_A_new_approach_to_Kanerva's_sparse_distributed_memory","3077357_Capacity_of_the_Kanerva_associative_memory"]}
