Among which, most of the data (approx. 85%) is in unstructured textual form. Text, so it has become essential to develop better techniques and algorithms to extract useful and interesting information from this large amount of textual data. Hence, the area of text mining and information extraction has become popular areas of research, to extract interesting and useful information. This paper, focuses on the concept, process and applications of Text Mining.","authors":["Lokesh Kumar"],"meta":["January 2013","Project: Information Extraction"],"references":["42802926_A_Survey_of_Text_Mining_Techniques_and_Applications","7309281_The_use_of_an_Internet-based_Ask_the_Doctor_Service_involving_family_physicians_evaluation_by_a_web_survey","252402230_The_Development_of_Text-Mining_Tools_and_Algorithms","224289441_Study_of_Web_Information_Extraction_and_Classification_Method","14198641_Requests_for_medical_advice_from_patients_and_families_to_health_care_providers_who_publish_on_the_World_Wide_Web"]}
