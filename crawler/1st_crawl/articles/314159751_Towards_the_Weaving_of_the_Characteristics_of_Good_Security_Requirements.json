{"id":"314159751_Towards_the_Weaving_of_the_Characteristics_of_Good_Security_Requirements","abstract":"Over the past two decades, there has been a significant emphasis on the research work towards the amelioration within the discipline of security requirements engineering. Many researchers, international standards and organizations have come up with various methodologies to facilitate the elicitation and evaluation of security requirements. However, the task of deriving good quality requirements still remains challenging. One of the main reasons is that there is no consensus in defining what is a good and a bad requirement. The purpose of this paper is to provide with a survey of various quality characteristics of requirements proposed by various authors from different perspectives. Our survey analysis shows that there are a total of 20 distinctive characteristics that are defined in order to evaluate the quality aspects of requirements.","authors":["Sravani Teja Bulusu","Romain Laborde","Ahmad Samer Wazan","François Barrère"],"meta":["March 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-54876-0_5","Conference: International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems"],"references":["229525070_Economics_of_software_re-engineering","221548892_A_Pattern_System_for_Security_Requirements_Engineering","262347456_Using_Requirements_Engineering_in_an_Automatic_Security_Policy_Derivation_Process","262280857_Writing_quality_requirements","261309808_Zerocoin_Anonymous_Distributed_E-Cash_from_Bitcoin","237036933_Requirements_Engineering_A_Good_Practice_Guide","223057710_Risk_analysis_Requirements_conflicts_and_problems","222515733_A_systematic_literature_review_to_identify_and_classify_software_requirement_errors","221512523_Engineering_Software_and_Software_Engineering","220694720_Requirements_Engineering"]}
