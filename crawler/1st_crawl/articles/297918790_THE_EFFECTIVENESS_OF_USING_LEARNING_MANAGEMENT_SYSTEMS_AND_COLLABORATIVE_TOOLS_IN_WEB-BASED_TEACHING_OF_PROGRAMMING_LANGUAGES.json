The system has been tested with 36 students taking the Java and the Pascal programming courses. The results of the pilot study showed that a Learning Management System can be made more efficient if it is enhanced by a collaborative learning tool. Our results have also shown that programming languages such as Pascal and Java can be thought successfully in a web-based environment using an LMS system together with a collaborative tool.","authors":["Nadire Cavus","HÃ¼seyin Uzunboylu","Dogan Ibrahim"],"meta":["January 2006"],"references":["296680351_THE_EFFECTIVENESS_OF_WEB_ASSISTED_ENGLISH_LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTION_ON_THE_ACHIEVEMENT_AND_ATTITUDE_OF_THE_STUDENTS","246665954_Learning_by_Collaborating_Convergent_Conceptual_Change","271787068_Distance_Education_Learning_Outcomes_Interaction_and_Attitudes","247761931_Video_Teleconferencing_and_Performance","243756750_Distance_Education_A_Systems_View","234620944_The_Effects_of_Distance_Learning_A_Summary_of_Literature_Research_Monograph_Number_2","233004320_Personality_characteristics_differentiating_and_predicting_the_achievement_of_televised-course_students_and_traditional-course_students_1","225438466_Student_feedback_in_the_college_classroom_A_technology_solution","225360260_A_Review_of_Two_Mainline_E-Learning_Projects_in_the_European_Union"]}
