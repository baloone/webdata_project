{"id":"30051673_Contributions_to_Geography_The_Spaces_of_Heidegger's_Beitrage","abstract":"In this paper I provide a reading of Heidegger’s Beiträge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis) [the contributions to philosophy (of propriation)] as a contribution to geography. This collection of manuscripts, written between 1936 and 1938, is extremely important in terms of the development of Heidegger’s work, his political career, and his rethinking of the relation between space and time. This rethinking is one of the key themes discussed, along with the political and geographical implications of Heidegger’s notion of calculation. In order to situate these insights, I first provide a discussion of the context within which Heidegger wrote the work. After outlining this biographical, intellectual, and political situation, I move to the geographical contributions, suggesting ways in which Heidegger’s thought can impact on our thinking of environment, nature, globalisation, and measurement.","authors":["Stuart Elden"],"meta":["December 2005Environment and Planning D Society and Space 23(6)","DOI:10.1068/d369t"],"references":["285036274_Speaking_against_number_Heidegger_language_and_the_politics_of_calculation","282444603_Dwelling_Place_and_Environment","348862223_Heidegger_and_the_Political","345919170_The_Order_of_Nature_in_Aristotle's_Physics_Place_and_the_Elements","332297465_An_Invitation_to_Think_through_and_with_Heidegger's_Beitrage_zur_Philosophie","332293595_The_Echo_of_Being_in_Beitrage_zur_Philosophie-Der_Anklang_Directives_for_its_Interpretation","324329253_The_Order_of_Nature_in_Aristotle's_Physics_Place_and_the_Elements","315193675_Martin_Heidegger_A_Political_Life","312537018_The_fate_of_place_A_philosophical_history","291263619_Thinking_with_Heidegger_Displacements"]}
