{"id":"286334737_Stochastic_Comparisons_of_Cumulative_Entropies","abstract":"The cumulative entropy is an information measure which is alternative to the differential entropy and is connected with a notion in reliability theory. Indeed, the cumulative entropy of a random lifetime X can be expressed as the expectation of its mean inactivity time evaluated at X. After a brief review of its main properties, in this paper, we relate the cumulative entropy to the cumulative inaccuracy and provide some inequalities based on suitable stochastic orderings. We also show a characterization property of the dynamic version of the cumulative entropy. In conclusion, a stochastic comparison between the empirical cumulative entropy and the empirical cumulative inaccuracy is investigated.","authors":["Antonio Di Crescenzo","Maria Longobardi"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4614-6892-9_8","In book: Stochastic Orders in Reliability and Risk (pp.167-182)"],"references":["266309877_Some_applications_of_the_Laplace_transform_ratio_order","233231567_Stochastic_Properties_of_Residual_Life_and_Inactivity_Time_at_a_Random_Time","38350431_A_probabilistic_analogue_of_the_mean_value_theorem_and_its_applications_to_reliability_theory","26545252_An_Alternative_to_Entropy_in_the_Measurement_of_Information","3085071_Cumulative_Residual_Entropy_A_New_Measure_of_Information","2136684_On_Weighted_Residual_and_Past_Entropies","334946176_On_the_dynamic_cumulative_residual_entropy","314943486_A_probabilistic_analogue_of_the_mean_value_theorem_and_its_applications_to_reliability_theory","305974127_New_partial_ordering_of_survival_functions_based_on_the_notion_of_uncertainty","274891554_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_New-York","272705342_Some_Characterization_Results_Based_on_Dynamic_Survival_and_Failure_Entropies","267478399_Stochastic_Orders","265369175_New_Partial_Ordering_of_Survival_Functions_Based_on_the_Notion_of_Uncertainty","265365981_Inaccuracy_and_Inference","265329243_How_to_measure_uncertainty_in_the_life_time_distributions","252047674_Weighted_cumulative_entropy_and_its_estimation","242997790_Some_new_results_on_the_cumulative_residual_entropy","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","234779873_Characterizations_of_the_RHR_and_MIT_orderings_and_the_DHHR_and_IMIT_classes_of_life_distributions","233277746_Information_measure_shifts_and_distribution_metrics","231859697_Further_results_involving_the_MIT_order_and_the_IMIT_class","231858336_The_Reversed_Hazard_Rate_Function","229675586_Properties_of_a_Mean_Residual_Life_Function_Arising_from_Renewal_Theory","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","227536586_Information_Measures_in_Perspective","227164145_Some_properties_of_the_minimum_and_the_maximum_of_random_variables_with_joint_logconcave_distributions","225786773_More_on_a_New_Concept_of_Entropy_and_Information","221432584_Neuronal_Data_Analysis_Based_on_the_Empirical_Cumulative_Entropy","221308941_On_Cumulative_Entropies_and_Lifetime_Estimations","220411114_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","220024164_Information_Theory_and_Statistical_Mechanics_2","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","51153052_Entropy_of_Continuous_Mixtures_and_the_Measure_Problem","48191880_On_cumulative_entropies","45695505_Non-Rigid_Multi-Modal_Image_Registration_Using_Cross-Cumulative_Residual_Entropy","38350296_Entropy-based_measure_of_uncertainty_in_past_lifetime_distributions","24060802_Mean_residual_life_functions_of_finite_mixtures_and_systems","23634030_Residual_entropy_and_its_characterizations_in_terms_of_hazard_function_and_mean_residual_life_function","23632903_Some_results_on_ordering_of_survival_functions_through_uncertainty","13988269_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","4038411_Cumulative_residual_entropy_a_new_measure_of_information_its_application_to_image_alignment"]}
