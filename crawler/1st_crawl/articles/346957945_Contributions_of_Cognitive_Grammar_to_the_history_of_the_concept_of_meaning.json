{"id":"346957945_Contributions_of_Cognitive_Grammar_to_the_history_of_the_concept_of_meaning","abstract":"This text intends to systematize the studies in the history of the concepts of meaning in order to understand the evolution of this linguistic topic, over the last decades, within the framework of cog- nitive linguistics.\nThe meaning of words, sentences and texts is the object of study of semantics, a discipline of linguistics that focuses on the meaning of linguistic expressions, as well as on the relations of mean- ing that these expressions celebrate among each other and with the world. The semantic properties of natural languages can be studied at all linguistic levels.\nAs a consequence of the growing awareness of the pragmatic dimension of language and of the dissolution of traditional oppositions among syntax, semantics and lexicon in linguistics, we realize that, in the second half of the twentieth century, there was a theoretical and methodological renewal and the creation of new disciplinary areas. In the 1980s, a link was established among linguistics, computer science and cognitive psychology. In this text, we highlight the contribution of all these areas to the concept of “meaning”, especially that of cognitive grammar, which identifies and repre- sents the conceptual structures that are conventionalized in grammatical constructions, transferring our conceptual perception of the world to meaning.","authors":["Carlos Assunção","Carla Sofia Araújo","Fábio Ribeiro"],"meta":["December 2020Beitrage zur Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaft 30(2):291-304"],"references":["323128502_O_Mundo_dos_Sentidos_em_Portugues_Polissemia_Semantica_e_Cognicao","313243062_Die_Bedeutungslehre_-_ein_Irrweg_der_Sprachwissenschaft","273097601_Semantique_Interpretative","270731991_Corpus_Linguistics_at_Work","237215082_UNIVERSITA'_DEGLI_STUDI_DI_ROMA","236026075_Discours_de_la_methode","28763004_A_Review_of_B_F_Skinner's_Verbal_Behavior"]}
