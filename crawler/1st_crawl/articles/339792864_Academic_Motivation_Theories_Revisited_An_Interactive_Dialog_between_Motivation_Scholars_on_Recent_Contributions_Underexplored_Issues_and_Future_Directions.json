{"id":"339792864_Academic_Motivation_Theories_Revisited_An_Interactive_Dialog_between_Motivation_Scholars_on_Recent_Contributions_Underexplored_Issues_and_Future_Directions","abstract":"In this article, I introduce the current special issue, which brings together leading scholars who either initiated or played subsequent central roles in the inception and development of five prominent theories of academic motivation: attribution theory, expectancy-value theory, social-cognitive theory, achievement goal theory, and self-determination theory. I begin by discussing the need for a special issue devoted to these theories and then summarize its overarching goals: (1) provide an outlet for leading theorists to update their work; (2) cast a spotlight on three underexplored and timely issues regarding motivation theory (diversity, methodology, and interventions); (3) have leading scholars discuss their recommendations for future directions; and (4) facilitate an interactive dialog between and among the theorists and three commentators who suggest alternative perspectives on the study of motivation. I conclude with an overview of the five theory articles and three commentaries included in this special issue.","authors":["Alison C.
