{"id":"257406876_The_Linear_t-Colorings_of_Sierpinski-Like_Graphs","abstract":"A proper t-coloring of a graph G is a mapping \n\n${\\varphi: V(G) \\rightarrow [1, t]}$\nsuch that \n\n${\\varphi(u) \\neq \\varphi(v)}$\nif u and v are adjacent vertices, where t is a positive integer. The chromatic number of a graph G, denoted by \n\n${\\chi(G)}$\n, is the minimum number of colors required in any proper coloring of G. A linear t-coloring of a graph is a proper t-coloring such that the graph induced by the vertices of any two color classes is the union of vertex-disjoint paths. The linear chromatic number of a graph G, denoted by \n\n${lc(G)}$\n, is the minimum t such that G has a linear t-coloring. In this paper, the linear t-colorings of Sierpi≈Ñski-like graphs S(n, k), \n\n${S^+(n, k)}$\nand \n\n${S^{++}(n, k)}$\nare studied. It is obtained that \n\n${lc(S(n, k))= \\chi (S(n, k)) = k}$\nfor any positive integers n and k, \n\n${lc(S^+(n, k)) = \\chi(S^+(n, k)) = k}$\nand \n\n${lc(S^{++}(n, k)) = \\chi(S^{++}(n, k)) = k}$\nfor any positive integers \n\n${n \\geq 2}$\nand \n\n${k \\geq 3}$\n. Furthermore, we have determined the number of paths and the length of each path in the subgraph induced by the union of any two color classes completely.","authors":["Bing Xue","Liancui Zuo","Guanghui Wang","Guojun Li"],"meta":["May 2014Graphs and Combinatorics 30(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-013-1289-9"],"references":["268859598_Codes_and_L21-labelings_in_Sierpinski_graphs","266988884_On_some_metric_properties_of_the_Sierpinski_graphs_Snk","307927353_THE_TOWER_OF_HANOI","285889619_Completeness_of_the_Lipscomb_space","285889205_Growth_in_repeated_truncations_of_maps","268613709_Lipscomb's_LA_Space_Fractalized_in_Hilbert's_l_2_A_Space","268497806_Results_and_open_problems_on_the_Tower_of_Hanoi","266577145_Equitable_L21-labelings_of_Sierpinski_graphs","265640287_The_Tower_of_Hanoi","262366970_Pascal's_Triangle_and_the_Tower_of_Hanoi"]}
