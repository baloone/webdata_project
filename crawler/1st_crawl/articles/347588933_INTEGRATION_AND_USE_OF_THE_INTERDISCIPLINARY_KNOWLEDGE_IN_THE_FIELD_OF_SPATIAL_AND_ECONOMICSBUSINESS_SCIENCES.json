{"id":"347588933_INTEGRATION_AND_USE_OF_THE_INTERDISCIPLINARY_KNOWLEDGE_IN_THE_FIELD_OF_SPATIAL_AND_ECONOMICSBUSINESS_SCIENCES","abstract":"This research arises from the importance of integration of knowledge of economics/business and spatial sciences for graduates who must think and act in interdisciplinary contexts.The systematic literature review revealed thatthis interdisciplinary field is richly present in original scientific research, and is undoubtedly topical and worthy of research efforts. Themain objective of this paper is toanalyse important factors that contribute to the attitudes of students towards interdisciplinary knowledge, and factors that shape their intentions to use and integrate this knowledge in the future. The conceptual model formed was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Research results confirm the importance of integration of economics/business and spatial sciences knowledge, for graduates. As presented in the paper, results of thestudyhave important implications for higher education institutions, reforming and updating their study programs, as well as for educators in the field of spatial sciences and economic/business sciences, in research and in education.","authors":["Polona Tominc","Vít Pászto","Samo Bobek","Simona Sternad"],"meta":["July 2019Croatian Journal of Education - Hrvatski časopis za odgoj i obrazovanje 21(3)","DOI:10.15516/cje.v21i3.3199"],"references":[]}
