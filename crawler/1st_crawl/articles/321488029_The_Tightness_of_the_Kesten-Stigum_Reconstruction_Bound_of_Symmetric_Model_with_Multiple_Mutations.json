{"id":"321488029_The_Tightness_of_the_Kesten-Stigum_Reconstruction_Bound_of_Symmetric_Model_with_Multiple_Mutations","abstract":"It is well known that reconstruction problems, as the interdisciplinary subject, have been studied in numerous contexts including statistical physics, information theory and computational biology, to name a few. We consider a $2q$-state symmetric model, with two categories of $q$ states in each category, and 3 transition probabilities: the probability to remain in the same state, the probability to change states but remain in the same category, and the probability to change categories. We construct a nonlinear second order dynamical system based on this model and show that the Kesten-Stigum reconstruction bound is not tight when $q \\geq 4$.","authors":["Wenjian Liu","Sreenivasa Rao Jammalamadaka","Ning Ning"],"meta":["February 2018Journal of Statistical Physics 170(1â€“2)","DOI:10.1007/s10955-017-1937-1"],"references":["321487611_Reconstruction_for_the_Asymmetric_Ising_Model_on_Regular_Trees","284103471_Reconstruction_of_a_Real_World_Social_Network_Using_the_Potts_Model_and_Loopy_Belief_Propagation","281487933_Periodic_Striped_Ground_States_in_Ising_Models_with_Competing_Interactions","345235856_Phylogenies_in_Ecology_A_Guide_to_Concepts_and_Methods","344473616_Phase_transitions_in_phylogeny","321331258_Optimal_Phylogenetic_Reconstruction","316517224_Survey_Information_flow_on_trees","301848676_The_Kesten-Stigum_Reconstruction_Bound_Is_Tight_for_Roughly_Symmetric_Binary_Channels","267441795_Gibbs_Measures_and_Phase_Transitions","265333396_Gibbs_Measures_and_Phase_TransitionsBerlin_Walter_de_Gruyter"]}
