{"id":"334477663_Student's_Success_Prediction_Model_Based_on_Artificial_Neural_Networks_ANN_and_A_Combination_of_Feature_Selection_Methods","abstract":"The improvements in educational data mining (EDM) and machine learning motivated the academic staff to implement educational models to predict the performance of students and find the factors that increase their success. EDM faced many approaches for classifying, analyzing and predicting a student\"s academic performance. This paper presents a model of prediction based on an artificial neural network (ANN) by implementing feature selection (FS). A questionnaire is built to collect students\" answers using LimeSurvey and google forms. The questionnaire holds a combination of 61 questions that cover many fields such as sports, health, residence, academic activities, social and managerial information. 161 students participated in the survey from two departments (. The data set is combined from two sources applications and is pre-processed by removing the uncompleted answers to produce 151 answers used in the model. Apart from the model, the FS approach is implemented to find the top correlated questions that affect the final class (Grade). The aim of FS is to eliminate the unimportant questions and find those which are important, besides improving the accuracy of the model. A combination of Four FS methods (Info Gain, Correlation, SVM and PCA) are tested and the average rank of these algorithms is obtained to find the top 30 questions out of 61 questions of the questionnaire. Artificial Neural Network is implemented to predict the grade (Pass (P) or Failed (F)). The model performance is compared with three previous models to prove its optimality.","authors":["Alaa Khalaf","Aqeel Majeed Humadi"],"meta":["June 2019Xinan Jiaotong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University 54(3)","DOI:10.35741/issn.0258-2724.54.3.25"],"references":["344300086_Studying_the_Impact_of_Handling_the_Missing_Values_on_the_Dataset_On_the_Efficiency_of_Data_Mining_Techniques","331311528_Predicting_Students_Academic_Performance_Using_Education_Data_Mining","328203019_Analyzing_students'_answers_using_association_rule_mining_based_on_feature_selection","327844402_Combining_Machine_Learning_Classifiers_for_the_Task_of_Arabic_Characters_Recognition","324692200_Classifying_students'_answers_using_clustering_algorithms_based_on_principle_component_analysis","323371097_Predicting_Student_Performance_in_Higher_Education_Institutions_Using_Decision_Tree_Analysis","321790262_Studentss_Success_Prediction_Based_on_Bayes_Algorithms","344300321_An_Efficient_Approach_For_Medical_Text_Categorization_Based_On_Clustering_And_Similarity_Measures","327806017_A_comparative_study_to_obtain_an_adequate_model_in_prediction_of_electricity_requirements_for_a_given_future_period","321888560_Student_performance_prediction_using_SVM","319165523_Online_Real_Time_Fuzzy_Inference_System_Based_Human_Health_Monitoring_and_Medical_Decision_Making","316543358_HYBRID_K-MEANS_CLUSTERING_FOR_COLOR_IMAGE_SEGMENTATION","315513030_Improved_Arabic_characters_recognition_by_combining_multiple_machine_learning_classifiers","313385761_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","309763904_Routing_with_Congestion_Control_in_Computer_Network_using_Neural_Networks"]}
