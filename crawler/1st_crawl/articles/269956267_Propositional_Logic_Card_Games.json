{"id":"269956267_Propositional_Logic_Card_Games","abstract":"In this paper I discuss card games designed to supplement or replace exercise sets on derivability and entailment in propositional logic. I present rules for two propositional logic card games that introduce chance and competition into discussions of propositional logic. The latter sections provide brief practical and theoretical notes on this kind of game, including ways courses that use these games can be more effective than courses that do not.","authors":["Anthony Shiver"],"meta":["March 2013Teaching Philosophy 36(1):51-58","DOI:10.5840/teachphil20133614"],"references":[]}
