This operator has all the required properties: it conserves particles, total momentum and energy, fulfills the Boltzmann H theorem and recovers neoclassical results. This operator takes into account both pitch angle scattering and energy diffusion while operating in the v∥,μ phase space. Derivatives with respect to the magnetic moment are treated using a projection on a set of orthogonal polynomials. The numerical aspects of the implementation are detailed and a set of physical benchmarks allows a verification of the properties of the operator.","authors":["Peter Donnel","Xavier Garbet","Yanick Sarazin","Virginie Grandgirard"],"meta":["September 2018Computer Physics Communications 234","DOI:10.1016/j.cpc.2018.08.008"],"references":["316440031_Self-consistent_gyrokinetic_modeling_of_neoclassical_and_turbulent_impurity_transport","287111078_A_multi-species_collisional_operator_for_full-F_gyrokinetics","234841195_Neoclassical_poloidal_and_toroidal_rotation_in_tokamaks","231035012_Radial_structures_and_nonlinear_excitation_of_geodesic_acoustic_modes","49459831_Global_Collisional_Gyrokinetic_Simulations_of_ITG_Microturbulence_Starting_from_a_Neoclassical_Equilibrium","41310614_Linearized_Model_Collision_Operators_for_Multiple_Ion_Species_Plasmas_and_Gyrokinetic_Entropy_Balance_Equations","2206544_Linearized_model_Fokker-Planck_collision_operators_for_gyrokinetic_simulations_II_Numerical_implementation_and_tests","2170668_A_guiding-center_Fokker-Planck_collision_operator_for_nonuniform_magnetic_fields","1746178_Linearized_model_Fokker-Planck_collision_operators_for_gyrokinetic_simulations_I_Theory","282510262_Enhanced_stabilisation_of_trapped_electron_modes_by_collisional_energy_scattering_in_tokamaks","253978779_Approximate_Fokker-Planck_collision_operator_for_transport_theory_applications","252902293_Effect_of_impurity_particles_on_the_finite-aspect_ratio_neoclassical_ion_thermal_conductivity_in_a_tokamak","243474491_Poloidal_Flow_Driven_by_Ion-Temperature-Gradient_Turbulence_in_Tokamaks","234841187_Theory_of_plasma_transport_in_toroidal_confinement_systems","232367509_The_global_version_of_the_gyrokinetic_turbulence_code_GENE","230950703_Neoclassical_transport_of_impurities_in_tokamak_plasmas","220390726_A_Practical_Method_for_Numerical_Evaluation_of_Partial_Differential_Equations_of_the_Heat_Conduction_Type"]}
