{"id":"282530911_Many-Objective_Evolutionary_Algorithms","abstract":"Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been widely used in real-world applications. However, most MOEAs based on Pareto-dominance handle many-objective problems (MaOPs) poorly due to a high proportion of incomparable and thus mutually nondominated solutions. Recently, a number ofmany-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been proposed to deal with this scalability issue. In this article, a survey of MaOEAs is reported. According to the key ideas used, MaOEAs are categorized into seven classes: relaxed dominance based, diversity-based, aggregation-based, indicator-based, reference set based, preference-based, and dimensionality reduction approaches. Several future research directions in this field are also discussed.","authors":["Bingdong Li","Jinlong Li","Ke Tang","Xin Yao"],"meta":["September 2015ACM Computing Surveys 48(1):1-35","DOI:10.1145/2792984"],"references":["324286003_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","314438904_An_Alternative_Preference_Relation_to_Deal_with_Many-Objective_Optimization_Problems","311509063_Searching_for_Pareto-optimal_solutions_through_dimensionality_reduction_for_certain_large-dimensional_multi-objective_optimization_problems","310589881_MOMBI_A_new_metaheuristic_for_many-objective_optimization_based_on_the_R2_indicator","305113969_Multiobjective_optimization_test_instances_for_the_CEC_2009_special_session_and_competition_University_of_Essex_Colchester_UK_and_Nanyang_Technological_University","303572117_Multiobjective_Optimization_and_Multiple_Constraint_Handling_with_Evolutionary_Algorithms_1_A_Unified_Formulation","302560124_A_fast_elitist_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II","291049439_Selection_Operators_Based_on_Maximin_Fitness_Function_for_Multi-Objective_Evolutionary_Algorithms","290742104_A_Real-World_Application_of_a_Many-Objective_Optimisation_Complexity_Reduction_Process","290742100_Adaptive_e-Sampling_and_e-Hood_for_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization"]}
