{"id":"280105061_How_to_prove_it_in_Natural_Deduction_A_Tactical_Approach","abstract":"The motivation for this paper comes out of our experience with teaching\nnatural deduction (ND) and with the way this formal system is implemented by\nthe \\textsc{Coq} proof assistant, namely by means of so-called tactics, which\nare heuristics that transform a goal formula into a sequence of subgoals whose\nprovability implies that of the original formula. We aim at capturing some of\nthese tactics into a system of ND for minimal logic. Our goal is twofold:\nformal and didactic. The former delivers a formal system with its underlying\nheuristics to build proofs, which in turn serves our latter purpose, that of\nmaking an ideal system for the teaching of ND at an undergraduate level in a\ncomputer science program.","authors":["Favio Ezequiel Miranda-Perea","Pilar selene Linares Arevalo","Atocha Aliseda-Llera"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["44922837_Teaching_logic_using_a_state-of-art_proof_assistant","2719249_Logic_in_Computer_Science_Modelling_and_Reasoning_About_Systems","277268712_Logica_para_principiantes","266963290_Natural_Deduction_Hybrid_Systems_and_Modal_Logics","258948784_How_to_Solve_It_A_New_Aspect_of_Mathematical_Method","243786603_Interactive_Theorem_Proving_and_Program_Development_-_Coq''Art_The_Calculus_of_Inductive_Constructions_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series_Springer-Verlag","221241460_Lambda_the_Ultimate_TA_Using_a_Proof_Assistant_to_Teach_Programming_Language_Foundations","2520348_A_Judgmental_Reconstruction_of_Modal_Logic"]}
