{"id":"340952926_Mobile_phone_data_for_informing_public_health_actions_across_the_COVID-19_pandemic_life_cycle","abstract":"This paper describes how mobile phone data can support government and public health policymaking throughout the COVID-19 pandemic lifecycle, providing increased situational awareness, more accurate predictions, impact assessment of the policies and cause-and-effect inferences. It identifies key gaps and reasons why this kind of data is only scarcely used, although their value has been proven by previous work in the context of other infectious diseases, such as malaria, dengue, ebola or the H1N1 flu. It presents ways to overcome these gaps and key recommendations for urgent action, most notably the establishment of mixed expert groups on national and regional level, and the inclusion and support of governments and public authorities early on. The manuscript is authored by a group of experienced data scientists, epidemiologists, demographers and representatives of mobile network operators who jointly put their work at the service of the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","authors":["Nuria Oliver","Bruno Lepri","Harald Sterly","Renaud Lambiotte"],"meta":["April 2020Science Advances 6(23):eabc0764","DOI:10.1126/sciadv.abc0764"],"references":["340640824_Projecting_the_transmission_dynamics_of_SARS-CoV-2_through_the_postpandemic_period","340328356_An_investigation_of_transmission_control_measures_during_the_first_50_days_of_the_COVID-19_epidemic_in_China","340316786_Quantifying_SARS-CoV-2_transmission_suggests_epidemic_control_with_digital_contact_tracing","340242855_COVID-19_outbreak_response_a_first_assessment_of_mobility_changes_in_Italy_following_national_lockdown","340180593_The_effect_of_human_mobility_and_control_measures_on_the_COVID-19_epidemic_in_China","339773373_The_effect_of_human_mobility_and_control_measures_on_the_COVID-19_epidemic_in_China","340649161_Ending_coronavirus_lockdowns_will_be_a_dangerous_process_of_trial_and_error","340127157_Interventions_to_mitigate_early_spread_of_SARS-CoV-2_in_Singapore_a_modelling_study","340108912_Aggregated_mobility_data_could_help_fight_COVID-19","340068851_Age_profile_of_susceptibility_mixing_and_social_distancing_shape_the_dynamics_of_the_novel_coronavirus_disease_2019_outbreak_in_China"]}
