{"id":"336919445_Design_and_Design_Thinking_in_STEM_Education","abstract":"Design and design thinking are vital to creativity and innovation, and have become increasingly important in the current movement of developing and implementing integrated STEM education. In this editorial, we build on existing research on design and design thinking, and discuss how studentsâ€™ learning and design thinking can be developed through design activities in not only engineering and technology, but also other disciplines as well as integrated STEM education.","authors":["Yeping Li","Alan H Schoenfeld","Andrea A.
