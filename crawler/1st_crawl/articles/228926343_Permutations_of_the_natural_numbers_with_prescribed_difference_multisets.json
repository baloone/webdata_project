{"id":"228926343_Permutations_of_the_natural_numbers_with_prescribed_difference_multisets","abstract":"We study permutations π of the natural numbers for which the numbers π(n) are chosen greedily under the restriction that the differences π(n)−n belong to a given (multi)subset M of Z for all n ∈ S, a given subset of N. Various combinatorial properties of such permutations (for quite general M and S) are exhibited and others conjectured. Our results generalise to a large extent known facts in the case M = Z, S = N, where the permutation π arises in the study of the game of Wythoff Nim.","authors":["Peter Hegarty","Urban Larsson"],"meta":["January 2006"],"references":["228611932_Complyconstrain_games_or_games_with_a_Muller_twist","2306655_My_Favorite_Integer_Sequences","266496698_On_Fraenkel's_N-Heap_Wythoff's_Conjectures","266431002_The_Zeckendorf_array_equals_the_Wythoff_array","266067416_THE_FIRST_COLUMN_OF_AN_INTERSPERSION","246393327_How_to_Beat_Your_Wythoff_Games'_Opponent_on_Three_Fronts","243065467_Interspersions_and_Dispersions","220717004_New_Games_Related_to_Old_and_New_Sequences","220187146_Generalized_Wythoff_arrays_shuffles_and_interspersions"]}
