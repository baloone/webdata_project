{"id":"285329047_Parallel_Feature_Selection_Based_on_MapReduce","abstract":"Feature selection is an important research topic in machine learning and pattern recognition. It is effective in reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant data, increasing learning accuracy, and improving result comprehensibility. However, in recent years, data has become increasingly larger in both number of instances and number of features in many applications. Classical feature selection method is out of work in processing large-scale dataset because of expensive computational cost. For improving computational speed, parallel feature selection is taken as the efficient method. MapReduce is an efficient distributional computing model to process large-scale data mining problems. In this paper, a parallel feature selection method based on MapReduce model is proposed. Large-scale dataset is partitioned into sub-datasets. Feature selection is operated on each computational node. Selected feature variables are combined into one feature vector in Reduce job. The parallel feature selection method is scalable. The efficiency of the method is illustrated through example analysis.","authors":["Zhanquan Sun"],"meta":["December 2014IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 13(3):252-264","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-01766-2-35"],"references":["267263089_Study_on_Parallel_SVM_Based_on_MapReduce","224216943_Applying_Twister_to_Scientific_Applications","221345776_Feature_Selection_for_High-Dimensional_Data_A_Fast_Correlation-Based_Filter_Solution","221150884_Parallel_Data_Mining_from_Multicore_to_Cloudy_Grids","220319920_Feature_Extraction_by_Non-Parametric_Mutual_Information_Maximization","51175496_Channeling_the_data_deluge","43049002_Advances_in_Cheminformatics_Methodologies_and_Infrastructure_to_Support_the_Data_Mining_of_Large_Heterogeneous_Chemical_Datasets","5608615_Choi_C_Input_Feature_Selection_for_Classification_Problems_IEEE_Trans_on_Neural_Networks_13_143-159","266310934_Motoda_H_Feature_Selection_for_Knowledge_Discovery_and_Data_Mining_Kluwer_Academic_USA","228017971_Dimensionality_Reduction","220520303_Mining_semantics_for_large_scale_integration_on_the_web","51035908_Scalable_Programming_and_Algorithms_for_Data-Intensive_Life_Science_Applications","7214045_Beyond_the_data_deluge_Data_integration_and_bio-ontologies"]}
