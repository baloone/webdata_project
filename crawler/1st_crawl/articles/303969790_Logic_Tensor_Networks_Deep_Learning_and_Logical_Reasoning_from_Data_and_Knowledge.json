{"id":"303969790_Logic_Tensor_Networks_Deep_Learning_and_Logical_Reasoning_from_Data_and_Knowledge","abstract":"We propose real logic: a uniform framework for integrating automatic learning and reasoning. Real logic is defined on a full first-order language where formulas have truth-value in the interval [0,1] and semantics defined concretely on the domain of real numbers. Logical constants are interpreted as (feature) vectors of real numbers. Real logic promotes a well-founded integration of deductive reasoning on knowledge-bases with efficient, data-driven relational machine learning. We show how Real Logic can be implemented in deep Tensor Neural Networks with the use of Google's TensorFlow primitives. The paper concludes with experiments on a simple but representative example of knowledge completion.","authors":["Luciano Serafini","Artur D'Avila Garcez"],"meta":["June 2016"],"references":["301839500_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","281380823_Injecting_Logical_Background_Knowledge_into_Embeddings_for_Relation_Extraction","274708305_Report_from_Dagstuhl_Seminar_14381_Neural-Symbolic_Learning_and_Reasoning","267271969_Towards_a_Model_Theory_for_Distributed_Representations","319770279_From_Machine_Learning_to_Machine_Reasoning","319770263_Reasoning_With_Neural_Tensor_Networks_for_Knowledge_Base_Completion","301408882_Learning_Image_Embeddings_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Improved_Multi-Modal_Semantics","299415691_Statistical_Relational_Artificial_Intelligence_Logic_Probability_and_Computation","291295837_Reasoning_with_neural_tensor_networks_for_knowledge_base_completion"]}
