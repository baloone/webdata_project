{"id":"344744067_Security_and_privacy_of_mobile_wallet_users_in_Bitcoin_Dash_Monero_and_Zcash","abstract":"Mobile devices play an increasingly important role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, yet their privacy guarantees remain unstudied. To verify transactions, they either trust a server or use simple payment verification.\nFirst, we review the security and privacy of popular Android wallets for Bitcoin and the three major privacy-focused cryptocurrencies (Dash, Monero, Zcash). Then, we investigate the network-level properties of cryptocurrencies and propose a method of transaction clustering based on timing analysis. We implement and test our method on selected wallets and show that a moderately resourceful attacker can correlate transactions issued from one device with relatively high accuracy.","authors":["Alex Biryukov","Sergei Tikhomirov"],"meta":["October 2019Pervasive and Mobile Computing 59(4):101030","DOI:10.1016/j.pmcj.2019.101030"],"references":["321147237_Could_Network_Information_Facilitate_Address_Clustering_in_Bitcoin","306290899_Timing_Analysis_for_Inferring_the_Topology_of_the_Bitcoin_Peer-to-Peer_Network","283294138_On_the_Privacy_Provisions_of_Bloom_Filters_in_Lightweight_Bitcoin_Clients","267272205_Bitcoin_over_Tor_isn't_a_good_idea","262732923_Deanonymisation_of_Clients_in_Bitcoin_P2P_Network","221655590_Towards_Measuring_Anonymity","325800904_Dandelion_Lightweight_Cryptocurrency_Networking_with_Formal_Anonymity_Guarantees","315666922_Anonymity_Properties_of_the_Bitcoin_P2P_Network","285690110_Mixcoin_Anonymity_for_Bitcoin_with_Accountable_Mixes","285677600_An_Analysis_of_Anonymity_in_Bitcoin_Using_P2P_Network_Traffic","267574352_CoinShuffle_Practical_Decentralized_Coin_Mixing_for_Bitcoin","2495611_Co-clustering_Documents_and_Words_Using_Bipartite_Spectral_Graph_Partitioning"]}
