{"id":"343933007_Knowledge_representation_and_curation_in_hierarchies_of_graphs","abstract":"The task of automatically extracting insights or building computational models fromknowledge on complex systems greatly relies on the choice of appropriate representation.This work makes an effort towards building a framework suitable for representation offragmented knowledge on complex systems and its semi-automated curation---continuouscollation, integration, annotation and revision.We propose a knowledge representation system based on hierarchies of graphs relatedwith graph homomorphisms. Individual graphs situated in such hierarchies representdistinct fragments of knowledge and the homomorphisms allow relating these fragments.Their graphical structure can be used efficiently to express entities and their relations. Wefocus on the design of mathematical mechanisms, based on algebraic approaches to graphrewriting, for transformation of individual graphs in hierarchies that maintain consistentrelations between them. Such mechanisms provide a transparent audit trail, as well as aninfrastructure for maintaining multiple versions of knowledge.We describe how the developed theory can be used for building schema-aware graphdatabases that provide schema-data co-evolution capabilities. The proposed knowledgerepresentation framework is used to build the KAMI (Knowledge Aggregation and ModelInstantiation) framework for curation of cellular signalling knowledge. The frameworkallows for semi-automated aggregation of individual facts on protein-protein interactionsinto knowledge corpora, reuse of this knowledge for instantiation of signalling models indifferent cellular contexts and generation of executable rule-based models.","authors":["Eugenia Oshurko"],"meta":["July 2020"],"references":["334976452_High_throughput_discovery_of_functional_protein_modifications_by_Hotspot_Thermal_Profiling","326100673_The_Kappa_platform_for_rule-based_modeling","324500488_Reachability_Analysis_via_Orthogonal_Sets_of_Patterns","321290965_From_word_models_to_executable_models_of_signaling_networks_using_automated_assembly","316848791_Living_in_Parallel_Realities_Co-Existing_Schema_Versions_with_a_Bidirectional_Database_Evolution_Language","315341304_Incremental_Update_for_Graph_Rewriting","306032698_Modelling_the_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Biological_Pathways","302937543_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications","300590463_The_LDBC_Social_Network_Benchmark","280221896_DARPA's_Big_Mechanism_program","279160579_A_High-Level_Language_for_Rule-Based_Modelling","276978804_Polymorphic_Sesqui-Pushout_Graph_Rewriting","266985489_Reversible_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","235669600_Programming_biological_models_in_Python_using_PySB","225926665_Recent_Advances_in_Schema_and_Ontology_Evolution","224026867_The_systems_biology_markup_language_SBML_a_medium_for_representation_and_exchange_of_biochemical_network_models","223806275_Algebraic_approach_to_single-pushout_graph_transformation","221213573_Worry-free_database_upgrades_Automated_model-driven_evolution_of_schemas_and_complex_mappings","221213000_Model_management_20_Manipulating_richer_mappings","221115234_A_Formal_Resolution_Strategy_for_Operation-Based_Conflicts_in_Model_Versioning_Using_Graph_Modifications","220713273_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","220713186_Conflict_Detection_for_Model_Versioning_Based_on_Graph_Modifications","220700422_Rule-Based_Modeling_of_Cellular_Signaling_Concurrency_Theory","220687785_Rule-Based_Modelling_and_Model_Perturbation","220426864_The_Role_of_Frame-Based_Representation_in_Reasoning","220416410_An_online_bibliography_on_schema_evolution","49753627_The_Biomolecular_Interaction_Network_Database_in_PSI-MI_25","47503802_Scalable_Simulation_of_Cellular_Signaling_Networks","343970819_Interactions_between_Causal_Structures_in_Graph_Rewriting_Systems","339210141_M-adhesive_transformation_systems_with_nested_application_conditions","336848836_Schema_Validation_and_Evolution_for_Graph_Databases","334585057_A_Framework_For_Representing_Knowledge","334135308_Knowledge_Representation_and_Update_in_Hierarchies_of_Graphs","331884936_Bio-Curation_for_Cellular_Signalling_The_KAMI_Project","325371427_Cypher_An_Evolving_Query_Language_for_Property_Graphs","320915585_High-Throughput_Chemical_Probing_of_Full-Length_Protein-Protein_Interactions","320074732_Foundations_of_Modern_Query_Languages_for_Graph_Databases","319395635_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","308092958_Mass-spectrometric_exploration_of_proteome_structure_and_function","301449230_Complex_Event_Extraction_using_DRUM","278968812_Signaling_pathway_of_MAPKERK_in_cell_proliferation_differentiation_migration_senescence_and_apoptosis","273312179_Co-evolving_meta-models_and_their_instance_models_A_formal_approach_based_on_graph_transformation","262410360_X-Evolution_A_System_for_XML_Schema_Evolution_and_Document_Adaptation","262032395_The_Wnt_signalling_pathway","242982550_Exponentiable_morphisms_partial_products_and_pullback_complements","240410049_Web_Ontology_Language_Overview_W3C_Recommendation","231944303_Parallelism_and_concurrency_in_high-level_replacement_systems","229422909_The_BioPAX_community_standard_for_pathway_data_sharing","220694612_Version_control_with_subversion_-_next_generation_open_source_version_control","215863688_The_Unified_Modeling_Language_Reference_Manual","46149107_Using_Manifold_Embedding_for_Assessing_and_Predicting_Protein_Interactions_from_High-throughput_Experimental_Data","45185313_Editing_Validating_and_Translating_of_SBGN_Maps","39994860_Adhesive_and_quasiadhesive_categories","38007791_The_Entity_Relationship_Model_-_Toward_a_Unified_View_of_Data","24366459_Rule-Based_Modeling_of_Biochemical_Systems_with_BioNetGen"]}
