{"id":"221353722_Failure_Trends_in_a_Large_Disk_Drive_Population","abstract":"It is estimated that over 90% of all new information produced in the world is being stored on magnetic media, most of it on hard disk drives (1). Taking into account the importance of the information in modern society and the impact of it in all social activities, it is inevitable that hard disk drives play an essential role not only in the computer industry but also in personal life. From this perspective, the probability that hard disk drives perform in a proper way is very important in order to build reliable architectures. The reliability of disk drives is sometimes of less importance and social impact but for certain activities - it is essential. For example consider disk drive failure in a medical system where the expected output dependent on the disk drive performance is of great importance for the proper and in time treatment of patients. To serve our discussion, under reliability of disk drives we will understand the probability that the drive performs useful and proper work in time and in a way that is expected by the user of the system. If the probability of performing useful work is high, that will be an indicator of more reliable disk drive as opposed to one that performs less useful work.","authors":["Eduardo Pinheiro","Wolf-Dietrich Weber","Luiz Andr√© Barroso"],"meta":["January 2007","SourceDBLP","Conference: 5th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies, FAST 2007, February 13-16, 2007, San Jose, CA, USA"],"references":[]}
