{"id":"307876130_Determining_of_a_robot_workspace_using_the_integration_of_a_CAD_system_with_a_virtual_control_system","abstract":"The paper presents a method for determining the workspace of an industrial robot using an approach consisting in integration a 3D model of an industrial robot with a virtual control system. The robot model with his work environment, prepared for motion simulation, was created in the \"Motion Simulation\" module of the Siemens PLM NX software. In the mentioned model components of the \"link\" type were created which map the geometrical form of particular elements of the robot and the components of \"joint\" type mapping way of cooperation of components of the \"link\" type. In the paper is proposed the solution in which the control process of a virtual robot is similar to the control process of a real robot using the manual control panel (teach pendant). For this purpose, the control application \"JOINT\" was created, which provides the manipulation of a virtual robot in accordance with its internal control system. The set of procedures stored in an .xlsx file is the element integrating the 3D robot model working in the CAD/CAE class system with the elaborated control application.","authors":["Krzysztof Herbu≈õ","Piotr Ociepka"],"meta":["August 2016IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 145(5)","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/145/5/052010"],"references":["307876146_Application_of_the_CBR_method_for_adding_the_process_of_cutting_tools_and_parameters_selection","284170322_Effect_of_thermomechanical_treatment_on_the_corrosion_behaviour_of_Si-_and_Al-containing_high-Mn_austenitic_steel_with_Nb_and_Ti_micro-additions","283913716_Carbon_fiber_based_composites_stress_analysis_Experimental_and_computer_comparative_studies","283849149_Application_of_CADCAE_class_systems_to_aerodynamic_analysis_of_electric_race_cars","283699179_Analysis_of_the_Hexapod_Work_Space_using_integration_of_a_CADCAE_system_and_the_LabVIEW_software","283655438_Strength_analysis_of_parallel_robot_components_in_PLM_Siemens_NX_85_program","283566022_Application_of_CBR_method_for_adding_the_process_of_cutting_tools_and_parameters_selection","283562444_Integration_of_the_virtual_3D_model_of_a_control_system_with_the_virtual_controller","283520684_Computer-aided_strength_analysis_of_the_modernized_freight_wagon","284709281_Mapping_of_the_Characteristics_of_a_Drive_Functioning_in_the_System_of_CAD_Class_Using_the_Integration_of_a_Virtual_Controller_with_a_Virtual_Model_of_a_Drive"]}
