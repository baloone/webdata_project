{"id":"335722970_NEW_NUMBERS_ON_EULER'S_TOTIENT_FUNCTION_WITH_APPLICATIONS","abstract":"For any positive integer $ m,~\\varphi (m) $ find out how many residues of $ m $ thats are co-prime to $ m $, where $\\varphi $ is the Euler's totient function. In this work, we introduce the notion of totient, super totient and hyper totient numbers and discuss their relations. Many postulates and characterizations of these numbers have been proposed with straight forward proofs. Finally, applications of these numbers in graph labeling have been demonstrated over a family of well known graph","authors":["Muhammad Khalid Mahmood","Shahbaz Ali"],"meta":["April 2019"],"references":["330480914_Novel_Labeling_Algorithm_on_Several_Classes_of_Graphs","38344275_On_multiply_perfect_numbers_with_a_special_property","312603437_On_Near_3-Perfect_Numbers","283021643_Algorithms_for_Zumkeller_Labeling_of_Full_Binary_Trees_and_Square_Grids","273640897_Generalized_Perfect_Numbers_Connected_with_Arithmetic_Functions","266220669_Multiply_perfect_numbers_in_Lucas_sequences_with_odd_parameters","259437744_On_near-perfect_numbers_with_two_distinct_prime_factors","243119656_Fermat_Numbers_and_Mersenne_Numbers","226365168_The_non-existence_of_odd_perfect_numbers_of_a_certain_form","45887383_On_Zumkeller_Numbers"]}
