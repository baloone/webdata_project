{"id":"269116212_Sylvester-Gallai_for_Arrangements_of_Subspaces","abstract":"In this work we study arrangements of $k$-dimensional subspaces\n$V_1,\\ldots,V_n \\subset \\mathbb{C}^\\ell$. Our main result shows that, if every\npair $V_{a},V_b$ of subspaces is contained in a dependent triple (a triple\n$V_{a},V_b,V_c$ contained in a $2k$-dimensional space), then the entire\narrangement must be contained in a subspace whose dimension depends only on $k$\n(and not on $n$). The theorem holds under the assumption that $V_a \\cap V_b =\n\\{0\\}$ for every pair (otherwise it is false). This generalizes the\nSylvester-Gallai theorem (or Kelly's theorem for complex numbers), which proves\nthe $k=1$ case. Our proof also handles arrangements in which we have many pairs\n(instead of all) appearing in dependent triples, generalizing the quantitative\nresults of Barak et. al. [BDWY-pnas].\nOne of the main ingredients in the proof is a strengthening of a Theorem of\nBarthe [Bar98] (from the $k=1$ to $k>1$ case) proving the existence of a linear\nmap that makes the angles between pairs of subspaces large on average. Such a\nmapping can be found, unless there is an obstruction in the form of a low\ndimensional subspace intersecting many of the spaces in the arrangement (in\nwhich case one can use a different argument to prove the main theorem).","authors":["Zeev Dvir","Guangda Hu"],"meta":["December 2016Discrete & Computational Geometry 56(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9781-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["232805108_Improved_rank_bounds_for_design_matrices_and_a_new_proof_of_Kelly'stheorem","285909427_Three_point_collinearity_Problem_4065","268963695_On_the_mathematical_question_What_is_a_tree","267186656_Linear_algebra_and_its_applications_2nd_edition","258699471_Breaking_the_quadratic_barrier_for_3-LCCs_over_the_Reals","248191947_Uber_Vielseite_der_Projektive_Ebene","245040434_A_resolution_of_the_Sylvester-Gallai_problem_of_J","244956492_A_generalization_of_a_theorem_of_Sylvester_on_the_lines_determined_by_a_nite_point_set","230871859_Fractional_Sylvester-Gallai_theorems","226638853_A_survey_of_Sylvester's_problem_and_its_generalizations","226395015_Sylvester-Gallai_Theorems_for_Complex_Numbers_and_Quaternions","221591611_Rank_bounds_for_design_matrices_with_applications_toc_ombinatorial_geometry_and_locally_correctable_codes","221580515_On_Matrix_Rigidity_and_Locally_Self-Correctable_Codes","220467864_On_Matrix_Rigidity_and_Locally_Self-correctable_Codes","46586684_Rank_Bounds_for_Design_Matrices_with_Applications_to_CombinatorialGeometry_and_Locally_Correctable_Codes"]}
