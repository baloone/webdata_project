{"id":"318256379_Distributed_Event-Based_State_Estimation_for_Networked_Systems_An_LMI-Approach","abstract":"In this work, a dynamic system is controlled by multiple sensor-actuator agents, each of them commanding and observing parts of the system's input and output. The different agents sporadically exchange data with each other via a common bus network according to local event-triggering protocols. From these data, each agent estimates the complete dynamic state of the system and uses its estimate for feedback control. We propose a synthesis procedure for designing the agents' state estimators and the event triggering thresholds. The resulting distributed and event-based control system is guaranteed to be stable and to satisfy a predefined estimation performance criterion. The approach is applied to the control of a vehicle platoon, where the method's trade-off between performance and communication, and the scalability in the number of agents is demonstrated.","authors":["Michael Muehlebach","Sebastian Trimpe"],"meta":["July 2017IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2017.2726002"],"references":["280018811_SDPT3_-_a_MATLAB_software_package_for_semidefinite_programming_version_13","271935579_The_event-driven_paradigm_for_control_communication_and_optimization","262350003_Low-power_wireless_bus","261490436_An_introduction_to_event-triggered_and_self-triggered_control","260661914_Event-Based_Sensor_Data_Scheduling_Trade-Off_Between_Communication_Rate_and_Estimation_Quality","247456496_SDPT3_--_a_MATLAB_software_package_for_semidefinite_programming","4232327_Fieldbus_Technology_and_Industrial_Automation","3032196_On_the_ill-posedness_of_certain_vehicular_platoon_control_problems","2986501_Fieldbus_Technology_in_Industrial_Automation","321526565_Studies_in_Systems_Decision_and_Control","312258514_Event-based_State_Estimation_An_Emulation-based_Approach","308631361_On_the_choice_of_the_event_trigger_in_event-based_estimation","306107355_Extended_H_2_and_H_infty_norm_characterizations_and_controller_parametrizations_for_discrete-time_systems","283283532_A_Decentralized_Event-Triggered_Dissipative_Control_Scheme_for_Systems_With_Multiple_Sensors_to_Sample_the_System_Outputs","282826702_LMI-based_synthesis_for_distributed_event-based_state_estimation","281943493_Stability_analysis_of_distributed_event-based_state_estimation","272239529_Experimental_evaluation_of_decentralized_cooperative_cruise_control_for_heavy-duty_vehicle_platooning","271659350_Distributed_state_estimation_in_sensor_networks_with_event-triggered_communication","271428868_Event-Based_State_Estimation_with_Switching_Static-Gain_Observers","268695404_Event-based_HH_filtering_for_sampled-data_systems","266920626_Event-Based_Control","260586211_The_Balancing_Cube_A_Dynamic_Sculpture_As_Test_Bed_for_Distributed_Estimation_and_Control","258985389_Yalmip_A_toolbox_for_modeling_and_optimization_in_MATLAB","256936330_Distributed_event-based_observers_for_LTI_networked_systems","256660866_Event-based_broadcasting_for_multi-agent_average_consensus","245322261_Extended_H2_and_H_characterization_and_controller_parametrizations_for_discrete-time_systems","230554866_Discrete-Time_Signal_Processing","225680756_Event-Triggered_Feedback_in_Control_Estimation_and_Optimization","225075788_Robust_and_Optimal_Control","222520542_Input-to-state_stability_for_discrete-time_nonlinear_systems","44346630_Computer-Controlled_Systems_Theory_and_Design","3031949_Disturbance_Propagation_in_Vehicle_Strings","3024893_On_the_Optimal_Error_Regulation_of_a_String_of_Moving_Vehicles","3024071_Changing_supply_functions_in_input_to_state_stable_systems_The_discrete-time_case"]}
