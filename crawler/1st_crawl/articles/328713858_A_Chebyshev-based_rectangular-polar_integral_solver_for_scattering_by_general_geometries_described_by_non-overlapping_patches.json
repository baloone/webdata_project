{"id":"328713858_A_Chebyshev-based_rectangular-polar_integral_solver_for_scattering_by_general_geometries_described_by_non-overlapping_patches","abstract":"This paper introduces a high-order-accurate strategy for integration of singular kernels and edge-singular integral densities that appear in the context of boundary integral equation formulations of the problem of acoustic scattering. In particular, the proposed method is designed for use in conjunction with geometry descriptions given by a set of arbitrary non-overlapping logically-quadrilateral patches---which makes the algorithm particularly well suited for treatment of CAD-generated geometries. Fej√©r's first quadrature rule is incorporated in the algorithm, to provide a spectrally accurate method for evaluation of contributions from far integration regions, while highly-accurate precomputations of singular and near-singular integrals over certain \"surface patches\" together with two-dimensional Chebyshev transforms and suitable surface-varying \"rectangular-polar\" changes of variables, are used to obtain the contributions for singular and near-singular interactions. The overall integration method is then used in conjunction with the linear-algebra solver GMRES to produce solutions for sound-soft open- and closed-surface scattering obstacles, including an application to an aircraft described by means of a CAD representation. The approach is robust, fast, and highly accurate: use of a few points per wavelength suffices for the algorithm to produce far-field accuracies of a fraction of a percent, and slight increases in the discretization densities give rise to significant accuracy improvements.","authors":["Oscar Bruno","Emmanuel Garza"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Computational Physics 421","DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109740"],"references":["321013703_Harmonic_density_interpolation_methods_for_high-order_evaluation_of_Laplace_layer_potentials_in_2D_and_3D","314183180_Windowed_Green_Function_method_for_the_Helmholtz_equation_in_presence_of_multiply_layered_media","280082303_Windowed_Green_Function_Method_for_Layered-Media_Scattering","259614788_Surface_scattering_in_three_dimensions_An_accelerated_high-order_solver","258654197_Regularized_integral_equations_and_fast_high-order_solvers_for_sound-hard_acoustic_scattering_problems","246168941_Fast_Multipole_Methods_for_the_Helmholtz_Equation_in_Three_Dimensions","237431559_General_edge_asymptotics_of_solution_of_second_order_elliptic_boundary_value_problems_I_II","230856572_Efficient_solution_of_three-dimensional_problems_of_acoustic_and_electromagnetic_scattering_by_open_surfaces","51940904_Convergence_analysis_of_a_high-order_Nystrom_integral-equation_methodfor_surface_scattering_problems","30772123_A_high-order_integral_algorithm_for_highly_singular_PDE_solutions_in_Lipschitz_domains","2405798_Chebyshev_and_Fourier_Spectral_Methods","324358239_Numerical_Recipes_The_Art_of_Scientific_Computing","309205431_Windowed_Green_Function_Method_for_Nonuniform_Open-Waveguide_Problems","309205350_Windowed_Green_Function_Method_for_Layered-Media_Scattering","307632254_General_edge_asymptotics_of_solutions_of_second-order_elliptic_boundary_value_problems_II","290089297_Surface_Integral_Equation_Method_for_Scattering_by_DB_Objects_with_Sharp_Wedges","284688078_VisIt_An_end-user_tool_for_visualizing_and_analyzing_very_large_data","256743901_A_Nystrom_method_for_weakly_singular_integral_operators_on_surfaces","246535168_Inverse_Acoustic_and_Electromagnetic_Scattering_Theory_Appl_Math_Sci","243096346_Nystrom's_Method_and_Iterative_Solvers_for_the_Solution_of_the_Double-Layer_Potential_Equation_over_Polyhedral_Boundaries","239365382_Acoustic_and_Electromagnetic_Equations-Integral_Representations_for_Harmonic_Problems","238884054_Product_Integration-Collocation_Methods_for_Noncompact_Integral_Operator_Equations","230738588_A_high-order_integral_solver_for_scalar_problems_of_diffraction_byscreens_and_apertures_in_three_dimensional_space","229786557_The_Double_Layer_Potential_Operator_over_Polyhedral_Domains_II_Spline_Galerkin_Methods","229158065_Quadrature_by_Expansion_A_New_Method_for_the_Evaluation_of_LayerPotentials","227736025_A_sinh_transformation_for_evaluating_nearly_singular_boundary_element_integrals","225885099_Fast_Construction_of_the_Fejer_and_Clenshaw-Curtis_Quadrature_Rules","225486555_Uber_eine_Methode_zum_raumlichen_Neumannschen_Problem_mit_einer_Anwendung_fur_torusartige_Berandungen","222677273_A_high-order_algorithm_for_obstacle_scattering_in_three_dimensions","222654129_A_Fast_High-Order_Algorithm_for_the_Solution_of_Surface_Scattering_Problems_Basic_Implementation_Tests_and_Applications","220261136_Ein_numerisches_Verfahren_zur_Losung_des_Neumannschen_Aussenraumproblems_fur_die_Helmholtzsche_Schwingungsgleichung","29464070_A_sinh_transformation_for_evaluating_two-dimensional_nearly_singular_boundary_element_integrals"]}
