Based on a known switching\nsignal and under the fulfillment of the relative degree property by all the subsystems,\na decoupling method is used to make the state partially affected by the unknown\ninput. Assuming that the disturbances and the measurement noises are unknown but\nbounded with a priori known bounds, lower and upper bounds of the unmeasured\nstate and unknown input are then computed. A numerical example illustrates the\nefficiency of the proposed methodology.","authors":["Haifa Ethabet","Tarek Raissi","Messaoud Amairi","Christophe Combastel"],"meta":["June 2018International Journal of Control 93(5)","DOI:10.1080/00207179.2018.1490820","Project: Robust estimation and control"],"references":["311911619_On_the_distinguishability_and_observer_design_for_single-input_single-output_continuous-time_switched_affine_systems_under_bounded_disturbances_with_application_to_chaos-based_modulation","310453798_Unknown_input_interval_observer_for_uncertain_linear_time_invariant_systems","312890514_Basic_problems_on_stability_and_design_of_switched_systems","311896434_Robust_estimation_algorithm_for_both_switching_signal_and_state_of_switched_linear_systems","308721073_Set-membership_methodology_for_model-based_prognosis","306113490_Interval_observer_design_for_Linear_Parameter-Varying_systems_subject_to_component_faults","294577486_Design_of_interval_observers_for_uncertain_dynamical_systems","293328641_Simultaneous_state_and_output_disturbance_estimations_for_a_class_of_switched_linear_systems_with_unknown_inputs","292186710_Set-membership_methods_applied_to_FDI_and_FTC","290180922_Real-time_fault-voltage_estimation_for_nonlinear_dynamic_power_systems","284195291_Interval_observer_for_Linear_Time_Invariant_LTI_uncertain_systems_with_state_and_unknown_input_estimations","281370537_Interval_Observers_For_Discrete-time_Systems","285755361_Fault_Detection_for_Linear_Switched_Systems_with_Average_Dwell_Time_Using_Unknown_Input_Observers","282899415_Functional_observer_for_switched_discrete-time_singular_systems_with_time_delays_and_unknown_inputs","280112572_Real-time_fault-voltage_estimation_for_nonlinear_dynamic_power_systems"]}
