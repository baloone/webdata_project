{"id":"278968835_A_Fast_Single_Image_Haze_Removal_Algorithm_Using_Color_Attenuation_Prior","abstract":"Single image haze removal has been a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature. In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful color attenuation prior for haze removal from a single input hazy image. By creating a linear model for modeling the scene depth of the hazy image under this novel prior and learning the parameters of the model with a supervised learning method, the depth information can be well recovered. With the depth map of the hazy image, we can easily estimate the transmission and restore the scene radiance via the atmospheric scattering model, and thus effectively remove the haze from a single image. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art haze removal algorithms in terms of both efficiency and the dehazing effect.","authors":["Qingsong Zhu","Jiaming Mai","Ling Shao"],"meta":["June 2015IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 24(11)","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2015.2446191","SourcePubMed"],"references":["263433322_Decomposition-Based_Transfer_Distance_Metric_Learning_for_Image_Classification","313086331_A_Taxonomy_And_Evaluation_Of_Dense_Two-Frame_Stereo_Correspondence_Algorithms","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","311467832_'Interactive_de_weathering_of_an_image_using_physical_models'","288696731_Single_Image_Dehazing_Using_Color_Attenuation_Prior","286594615_Investigating_Haze-Relevant_Features_in_a_Learning_Framework_for_Image_Dehazing","285906123_High-Resolution_Stereo_Datasets_with_Subpixel-Accurate_Ground_Truth","275340906_Random_Forests","272391173_Object_Detection_in_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Images_Based_on_Weakly_Supervised_Learning_and_High-Level_Feature_Learning","271548152_An_adaptive_and_effective_single_image_dehazing_algorithm_based_on_dark_channel_prior"]}
