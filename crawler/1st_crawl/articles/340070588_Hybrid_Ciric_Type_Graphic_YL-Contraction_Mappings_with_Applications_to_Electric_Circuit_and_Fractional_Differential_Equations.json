{"id":"340070588_Hybrid_Ciric_Type_Graphic_YL-Contraction_Mappings_with_Applications_to_Electric_Circuit_and_Fractional_Differential_Equations","abstract":"In this paper, we initiate the notion of Ćirić type rational graphic Υ , Λ -contraction pair mappings and provide some new related common fixed point results on partial b-metric spaces endowed with a directed graph G. We also give examples to illustrate our main results. Moreover, we present some applications on electric circuit equations and fractional differential equations.","authors":["Eskandar Ameer","Hassen Aydi","Arshad Muhammad","Manuel De la Sen"],"meta":["March 2020Symmetry 12(3):467","DOI:10.3390/sym12030467"],"references":["338608231_Fixed_point_results_via_a_Hausdorff_controlled_type_metric","337920576_On_Positive_Solutions_for_a_Fractional_Thermostat_Model_with_a_Convex-Concave_Source_Term_via_ps-Caputo_Fractional_Derivative","335849371_On_new_common_fixed_points_of_multivalued_varUpsilon_varLambda_Y_L_-contractions_in_complete_b-metric_spaces_and_related_application","333175606_On_L_U-Contractions_and_Applications_to_Nonlinear_Matrix_Equations","332247363_Some_Remarks_and_New_Results_in_Ordered_Partial_b-Metric_Spaces","331201757_Common_Fixed_Point_Theorems_of_Generalized_Multivalued_psph-Contractions_in_Complete_Metric_Spaces_with_Application","330778560_Fixed_Point_Results_for_Multi-Valued_Contractions_in_b-Metric_Spaces_and_an_Application","330379886_Hybrid_Multivalued_Type_Contraction_Mappings_in_aK-Complete_Partial_b-Metric_Spaces_and_Applications","329593830_Double_Controlled_Metric_Type_Spaces_and_Some_Fixed_Point_Results","328973993_A_Nadler-type_fixed_point_theorem_in_dislocated_spaces_and_applications"]}
