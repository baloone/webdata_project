{"id":"243772619_Memory-efficient_and_self-stabilizing_net-work_reset","abstract":"In this paper we consider the question of fault-tolerant distributed network protocols with extremely small memory requirements per processor. In particular, we show that even in the case of worst-case transient faults (i. e., in a self-stabilizing setting), many fundamental network protocols can be achieved using only O(log n) bits of memory per incident network edge. In the heart of our construction is a self-stabilizing asynchronous network reset protocol with the same small memory requirements.","authors":["Baruch Awerbuch","Rafail Ostrovsky"],"meta":["January 1994"],"references":[]}
