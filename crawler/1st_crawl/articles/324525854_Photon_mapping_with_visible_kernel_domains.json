{"id":"324525854_Photon_mapping_with_visible_kernel_domains","abstract":"Despite the strong efforts made in the last three decades, lighting simulation systems still remain prone to various types of imprecisions. This paper specifically tackles the problem of biases due to density estimation used in photon mapping approaches. We study the fundamental aspects of density estimation and exhibit the need for handling visibility in the early stage of the kernel domain definition. We show that properly managing visibility in the density estimation process allows to reduce or to remove biases all at once. In practice, we have implemented a 3D product kernel based on a polyhedral domain, with both point-to-point and point-to-surface visibility computation. Our experimental results illustrate the enhancements produced at every stage of density estimation, for direct photon maps visualization and progressive photon mapping.","authors":["Romuald Perrot","Lilian Aveneau","Frédéric Mora","Daniel Meneveaux"],"meta":["May 2019The Visual Computer 35(5):1-14","DOI:10.1007/s00371-018-1505-y"],"references":["265475898_Embree-A_Ray_Tracing_Kernel_Framework_for_Efficient_CPU_Ray_Tracing","327526184_Density_Estimation_for_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis","324410153_Density_Estimation_for_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis","324317409_Density_Estimation_for_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis","314830515_Scalable_photon_splatting_for_global_illumination","313088163_Physically_based_rendering_From_theory_to_implementation_Third_edition","283767633_Unbiased_Photon_Gathering_for_Light_Transport_Simulation","279235370_Modern_Multivariate_Statistical_Techniques_Regression_Classification_and_Manifold_Learning","278670284_Progressive_photon_mapping","270725775_A_Path_Space_Extension_for_Robust_Light_Transport_Simulation","255969703_Ray_Maps_for_Global_Illumination","246433065_Improved_Illumination_Estimation_for_Photon_Maps_in_Architectural_Scenes","256670534_Lazy_Visibility_Evaluation_for_Exact_Soft_Shadows","238727640_Robust_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Light_Transport_Simulation","238678102_Realisic_Image_Synthesis_Using_Photon_Mapping"]}
