{"id":"295249293_Open_educational_resources_and_college_textbook_choices_a_review_of_research_on_efficacy_and_perceptions","abstract":"Textbooks are a vital component in many higher education contexts. Increasing textbook prices, coupled with general rising costs of higher education have led some instructors to experiment with substituting open educational resources (OER) for commercial textbooks as their primary class curriculum. This article synthesizes the results of 16 studies that examine either (1) the influence of OER on student learning outcomes in higher education settings or (2) the perceptions of college students and instructors of OER. Results across multiple studies indicate that students generally achieve the same learning outcomes when OER are utilized and simultaneously save significant amounts of money. Studies across a variety of settings indicate that both students and faculty are generally positive regarding OER.","authors":["John Hilton"],"meta":["February 2016Educational Technology Research and Development 64(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11423-016-9434-9"],"references":["334491938_Online_and_Campus_College_Students_Like_Using_an_Open_Educational_Resource_Instead_of_a_Traditional_Textbook","327263178_Anreizkonzepte_fur_Open_Educational_Resources","286689967_An_OER_COUP_College_Teacher_and_Student_Perceptions_of_Open_Educational_Resources","283524439_A_multi-institutional_study_of_the_impact_of_open_textbook_adoption_on_the_learning_outcomes_of_post-secondary_students","281100522_Developing_a_Curriculum_of_Open_Educational_Resources_for_Linked_Data","330258393_Interactive_Learning_Online_at_Public_Universities_Evidence_from_a_Six-Campus_Randomized_Trial","319463292_Open_educational_resources_A_review_of_the_literature","298901536_The_Required_Textbook_Friend_Or_Foe_Dealing_With_The_Dilemma","285942049_How_much_do_study_habits_skills_and_attitudes_affect_student_performance_in_introductory_college_accounting_courses","276042810_The_cost_and_quality_of_online_open_textbooks_Perceptions_of_community_college_faculty_and_students"]}
