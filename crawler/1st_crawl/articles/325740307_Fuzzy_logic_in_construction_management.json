{"id":"325740307_Fuzzy_logic_in_construction_management","abstract":"The article is devoted to the development of a model of management of technological processes of construction on the basis of fuzzy logic. Construction is a complex open dynamic systems with elements of ambiguity and uncertainty. External factors are not always possible to clearly determine the relationships between the factors are constantly changing in a random way. The dynamics of the laws describing the external and internal parameters of the system of control over the construction process and their relationship with the growth of scientific and technical progress only increases. This is due to the emergence of new information flows, which depends both on internal and external multiple factors with elements of ambiguity and chance, but we need to make, to store, quickly process and transmit information for the elaboration and adoption of decisions.","authors":["Fjoder Klashanov"],"meta":["January 2018MATEC Web of Conferences 170(1):01111","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/201817001111"],"references":["249656984_Design_and_Analysis_of_a_Fibre-Shaped_Micro-Actuator_for_Robotic_Gripping","300377757_Theoretical_Base_of_the_Building_to_Models_of_Management_in_Construction","260985455_Precision_Positioning_Systems_An_Overview_of_the_State_of_Art"]}
