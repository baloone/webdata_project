{"id":"264129658_Exploring_Gamification_Techniques_for_Classroom_Management","abstract":"A variety of gamification techniques from the literature are used in two college courses. Some techniques, such as an experience point-based system and leaderboards, proved confusing or frustrating, while other techniques, such as adding a meaningful narrative layer and allowing students to create their own learning paths, engaged students more deeply. In this article, the techniques used and the effects of each are explored and suggestions are provided for instructors considering adding game layers to the classroom.","authors":["Scott Nicholson"],"meta":["June 2013","Conference: Games+Learning+Society 9.0At: Madison, WI"],"references":["264129666_Strategies_for_Meaningful_Gamification_Concepts_behind_Transformative_Play_and_Participatory_Museums","339856562_The_Multiplayer_Classroom_Designing_Coursework_as_a_Game","230854793_The_Gamification_of_Learning_and_Instruction_Game-based_Methods_and_Strategies_for_Training_and_Eduction","220694443_Gamification_by_Design_Implementing_Game_Mechanics_in_Web_and_Mobile_Apps"]}
