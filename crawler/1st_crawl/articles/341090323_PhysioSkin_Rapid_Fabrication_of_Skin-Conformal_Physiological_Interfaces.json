{"id":"341090323_PhysioSkin_Rapid_Fabrication_of_Skin-Conformal_Physiological_Interfaces","abstract":"Advances in rapid prototyping platforms have made physiological sensing accessible to a wide audience. However, off-the-shelf electrodes commonly used for capturing biosignals are typically thick, non-conformal and do not support customization. We present PhysioSkin, a rapid, do-it-yourself prototyping method for fabricating custom multi-modal physiological sensors, using commercial materials and a commodity desktop inkjet printer. It realizes ultrathin skin-conformal patches (∼1 µm) and interactive textiles that capture sEMG, EDA and ECG signals. It further supports fabricating devices\nwith custom levels of thickness and stretchability. We present detailed fabrication explorations on multiple substrate materials, functional inks and skin adhesive materials. Informed from the literature, we also provide design recommendations for each of the modalities. Evaluation results show that the sensor patches achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. Example applications demonstrate the functionality and versatility of our approach for prototyping a next generation of physiological devices that intimately couple with the human body.","authors":["Aditya Shekhar Nittala","Arshad Khan","Klaus Kruttwig","Tobias Kraus"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1145/3313831.3376366","Conference: CHI '20: Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing SystemsAt: Honolulu, Hawaii, USA"],"references":["335472824_Soft_Inkjet_Circuits_Rapid_Multi_Material_Fabrication_of_Soft_Circuits_Using_a_Commodity_Inkjet_Printer","332741925_ElectroDermis_Fully_Untethered_Stretchable_and_Highly-Customizable_Electronic_Bandages","332741740_Like_A_Second_Skin_Understanding_How_Epidermal_Devices_Affect_Human_Tactile_Perception","332740700_LASEC_Instant_Fabrication_of_Stretchable_Circuits_Using_a_Laser_Cutter","328323623_RESi_A_Highly_Flexible_Pressure-Sensitive_Imperceptible_Textile_Interface_Based_on_Resistive_Yarns","330488710_Wearable_Graphene_Nanotextile_Embedded_Smart_Armband_for_Cardiac_Monitoring","328326649_Tacttoo_A_Thin_and_Feel-Through_Tattoo_for_On-Skin_Tactile_Output","328088583_PhysioHMD_a_conformable_modular_toolkit_for_collecting_physiological_data_from_head-mounted_displays","327760904_Epidermal_Robots_Wearable_Sensors_That_Climb_on_the_Skin","327758838_Naptics_Convenient_and_Continuous_Blood_Pressure_Monitoring_during_Sleep","324664276_Silicone_Devices_A_Scalable_DIY_Approach_for_Fabricating_Self-Contained_Multi-Layered_Soft_Circuits_using_Microfluidics","323779867_Wrist_and_Arm_Body_Surface_Bipolar_ECG_Leads_Signal_and_Sensor_Study_for_Long-term_Rhythm_Monitoring","322236038_Ultraconformable_Temporary_Tattoo_Electrodes_for_Electrophysiology","324665310_Multi-Touch_Skin_A_Thin_and_Flexible_Multi-Touch_Sensor_for_On-Skin_Input","320572058_SmartSleeve_Real-time_Sensing_of_Surface_and_Deformation_Gestures_on_Flexible_Interactive_Textiles_using_a_Hybrid_Gesture_Detection_Pipeline"]}
