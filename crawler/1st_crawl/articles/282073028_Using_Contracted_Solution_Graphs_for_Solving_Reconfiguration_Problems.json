{"id":"282073028_Using_Contracted_Solution_Graphs_for_Solving_Reconfiguration_Problems","abstract":"We introduce in a general setting a dynamic programming method for solving\nreconfiguration problems. Our method is based on contracted solution graphs,\nwhich are obtained from solution graphs by performing an appropriate series of\nedge contractions that decrease the graph size without losing any critical\ninformation needed to solve the reconfiguration problem under consideration.\nOur general framework captures the approach behind known reconfiguration\nresults of Bonsma (2012) and Hatanaka, Ito and Zhou (2014). As a third example,\nwe apply the method to the following problem: given two $k$-colorings $\\alpha$\nand $\\beta$ of a graph $G$, can $\\alpha$ be modified into $\\beta$ by recoloring\none vertex of $G$ at a time, while maintaining a $k$-coloring throughout? This\nproblem is known to be PSPACE-hard even for bipartite planar graphs and $k=4$.\nBy applying our method in combination with a thorough exploitation of the graph\nstructure we obtain a polynomial time algorithm for $(k-2)$-connected chordal\ngraphs.","authors":["Paul Bonsma","Daniel Paulusma"],"meta":["November 2019Acta Informatica 56(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00236-019-00336-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["324653146_Introduction_to_Reconfiguration","323098261_Vertex_Cover_Reconfiguration_and_Beyond","318814221_Recognizing_Graphs_Close_to_Bipartite_Graphs_with_an_Application_to_Colouring_Reconfiguration","345145618_Reconfiguration_on_sparse_graphs","338929641_Homomorphism_Reconfiguration_via_Homotopy","331450982_The_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_on_Specific_Graph_Classes","321100974_The_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_on_Specific_Graph_Classes","320047136_Shortest_Reconfiguration_Paths_in_the_Solution_Space_of_Boolean_Formulas","317062217_Parameterized_Complexity_of_the_List_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_with_Graph_Parameters","307947435_The_complexity_of_dominating_set_reconfiguration","304537483_Rerouting_shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs","302917812_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","291009147_A_Reconfigurations_Analogue_of_Brooks'_Theorem","285207706_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring_and_CSP_Reconfiguration","282844715_Independent_Set_Reconfiguration_in_Cographs_and_their_Generalizations"]}
