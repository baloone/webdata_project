{"id":"305884920_Online_Peer_Assessment_Method_and_Digital_Technologies","abstract":"In this research, we undertake a systematic review of literature about Online Peer Assessment (OPA) in higher education, mediated by Digital Information and Communication Technology (DICT). We identify their optional and central characteristics and we map out practices (procedures and DICT) which can be transversal, adaptable and applied in several curriculum units and education regimes. The results indicate the use of OPA as a strategy that boosts “assessment for learning”. The methods of assessment and the kinds of DICT used indicate directions for greater involvement and responsibility from the part of the student in his/her learning. Existing literature identifies the need to develop students’ skills, proving them with opportunities for self-assessment and peer assessment on a regular basis through constructive feedback. From the results obtained, OPA is seen as a cognitive tool, contributing to the building of knowledge and to reflection about learning. Issues for further reflection are also identified such as the creative development of assessment methods with a focus on diversity and innovation in order to enhance students’ learning and academic results, taking into account their learning needs in face of the expectations of current and future education and the demands of society.","authors":["Selma Santos Rosa","Clara Pereira Coutinho","Maria Assunção Flores"],"meta":["July 2016Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 228:418-423","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.07.064"],"references":["320654698_The_Impact_of_Peer_Assessment_and_Feedback_Strategy_in_Learning_Computer_Programming_in_Higher_Education","264826108_Guess_it_Using_Gamificated_Apps_to_Support_Students_Foreign_Language_Learning_by_Organic_Driven_Community_Peer_Assessment","261196496_Online_peer_assessment_An_exploratory_case_study_in_a_higher_education_civil_engineering_course","259334375_Is_peer_assessment_of_asynchronous_group_discussions_fostering_skills_relevant_to_our_future_graduates","248607058_Student_response_system_and_learning_oral_presentation_skills","243545211_Student_Response_System_and_How_to_Make_Engineering_Students_Learn_Oral_Presentation_Skills","225445256_University_Students'_Perceptions_of_and_Attitudes_Toward_Online_Peer_Assessment","288641896_Promoting_learning_skills_through_teamwork_assessment_and_selfpeer_evaluation_in_higher_education","271668619_Perceptions_of_effectiveness_fairness_and_feedback_of_assessment_methods_a_study_in_higher_education","260033630_Using_a_mixed_research_method_to_evaluate_the_effectiveness_of_formative_assessment_in_supporting_student_teachers'_wiki_authoring"]}
