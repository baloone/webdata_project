{"id":"331810944_Anglophobia_as_art_Free_trade_and_protection_in_grover_cleveland_political_cartoons","abstract":"The scandals of the 1884 campaign made great fodder for the burgeoning field of political satire. A number of satirical publications emerged in support of Blaine, most notably The Judge, which published one of the more infamous cartoons of the campaign, Frank Beard's Another Voice for Grover Cleveland. The Republican stance on the tariff issue, evident in pro-GOP cartoons in the 1884 campaign, was largely couched in a mistrust of England. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, Anglophobia was framing the debate about the tariff leveled against imported goods. The principles of protective tariffs and expansion of United States influence in Western markets, the underpinnings of economic nationalism, were attractive to many Americans. Prominent economic nationalists of the period, such as Henry C. Carey, argued that the goal of the United States should be total economic independence. According to the school of thought, England's espousal of free trade was merely a ploy to maintain control of the marketplace.","authors":["H.
