{"id":"228345013_High_Speed_VLSI_Implementation_of_the_Hyperbolic_Tangent_Sigmoid_Function","abstract":"The hyperbolic tangent function is commonly used as the activation function in artificial neural networks. In this work, two different hardware implementations for the hy-perbolic tangent function are proposed. Both methods are based on the approximation of the function rather than cal-culating it, since it has an exponential nature. The first method uses a lookup table to approximate the function, while the second method reduces the size of the table by using range addressable decoding as opposed to the clas-sic decoding scheme. Hardware synthesis results show that proposed methods perform significantly faster, and use less area compared to other similar methods with the same amount of error.","authors":["Karl Leboeuf","Ashkan Hosseinzadeh Namin","Roberto Muscedere","Huapeng Wu"],"meta":["November 2008","DOI:10.1109/ICCIT.2008.131"],"references":["3769447_Neural_networks_with_digital_LUT_activation_functions","3349473_Approximation_of_sigmoid_function_and_the_derivative_for_hardware_implementation_of_artificial_neurons","3302845_Elementary_function_generators_for_neural-network_emulators","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","262562663_Neural_Network_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","224317823_A_digital_circuit_design_of_hyperbolic_tangent_sigmoid_function_for_neural_networks","3044884_Efficient_techniques_for_binary-to-multidigit_multidimensional_logarithmic_number_system_conversion_using_range-addressable_look-up_tables"]}
