Some of the field of electric engineering was about realizing those universal gates using transistors. Some of the field of chemical engineering was about using rare earth mines as semi conductors to make those transistors.\n- After this work: Conductors would permit to replace semi-conductors for the manufacturing of memoryless parts of chips.\n\nApplication number : 16024909 \nhttps://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair\nFig 51 is important to understand some videos : \nhttp://place6.com/pa.pdf\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ujc8_-wS_fo\n[The pins having the same number are connected]\nA Nor with wires only\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qdj-nPQbVQ\nAn xor with wires only\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWnAVVZrn-Y\nAn Addition with wires only\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3TEEZbB1Y0\nPrevious publications (figures 24 and 25 are to be fixed)\nhttp://ijcsn.org/IJCSN-2019/8-6/Wires-P-NP-in-Applied-Logic.pdf\nVideos of the previous publication :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4aoi-PCRcY","authors":["Rashad Zaguia"],"meta":["December 2019"],"references":[]}
