The neuron is implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA) and tested by experiments. As well as theoretical analysis, the experimental results show that the piecewise-linear function of the proposed neuron is programmable and robust against the change in the number of input signals. To demonstrate the effect of piecewise-linear activation function, pulse-mode multilayer neural network with on-chip learning is implemented on FPGA with the proposed neuron, and its learning performance is verified by experiments. By approximating the sigmoid function by the piecewise-linear function, the convergence rate of the learning and generalization capability are improved.","authors":["Hiroomi Hikawa"],"meta":["February 2003IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 14(5):1028-37","DOI:10.1109/TNN.2003.816058","SourcePubMed"],"references":["3324733_A_Performance_Analysis_of_Pulse_Stream_Neural_and_Fuzzy_Computing_Systems","229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors","221532426_FPGA_Implementation_of_a_Pulse_Density_Neural_Network_Using_Simultaneous_Perturbation","5613970_A_new_digital_pulse-mode_neuron_with_adjustable_activation_function","5598802_An_Accelerator_for_Neural_Networks_with_Pulse-Coded_Model_Neurons","5589644_Two_Digital_Circuits_for_a_Fully_Parallel_Stochastic_Neural_Network","3857526_Hardware_implementation_of_a_PCA_learning_network_by_anasynchronous_PDM_digital_circuit","3623251_An_artificial_neural_network_accelerator_for_pulse_coded_model-neurons","3323101_A_DTCNN_universal_machine_based_on_highly_parallel_2-D_cellular_automata_CAM2","3302783_Pattern_recognition_via_synchronization_in_phase-locked_loop_neural_networks","3302631_Frequency-based_multilayer_neural_network_with_on-chip_learning_and_enhanced_neuron_characteristics","3302037_Architecture_and_Statistical_Model_of_a_Pulse-Mode_Digital_Multilayer_Neural_Network","3301913_Random_Noise_Effects_in_Pulse-Mode_Digital_Multilayer_Neural_Networks","3301614_VLSI_Implementation_of_Synaptic_Weighting_and_Summing_in_Pulse_Coded_Neural-Type_Cells","3301575_The_Digi_Neocognitron_A_Digital_Neocognitron_Neural_Network_Model_for_VLSI","3183834_A_Digital_Architecture_Employing_Stochasticism_for_the_Simulation_of_Hopfield_Neural_Nets","2446096_Pattern_Recognition_Via_Synchronization_in_Phase-Locked_Loop_Neural_Networks"]}
