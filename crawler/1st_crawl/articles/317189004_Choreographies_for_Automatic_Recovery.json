{"id":"317189004_Choreographies_for_Automatic_Recovery","abstract":"We propose a choreographic model of reversible computations based on a conservative extension of global graphs and communicating finite-state machines. The main advantage of our approach is that does not require to instrument models in order to control reversibility but for a minor decoration of branches. We show that our models are conservative extensions of existing ones and that the reversible semantics guarantees causal consistency.","authors":["Claudio Antares Mezzina","Emilio Tuosto"],"meta":["May 2017"],"references":["306002252_Reversible_Multiparty_Sessions_with_Checkpoints","293806994_Retractable_Contracts","282576628_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Concurrent_Reversible_Computations","228796126_Reversible_Communicating_Concurrent_Systems","220997896_Multiparty_Asynchonous_Session_Types","220118443_Reversing_algebraic_process_calculi","313346400_Let_it_recover_multiparty_protocol-induced_recovery","278828881_Reversibility_in_the_higher-order_p-calculus","278801303_Controlled_Reversibility_and_Compensations","267075972_Multiparty_Session_Types_Meet_Communicating_Automata","220430671_On_Communicating_Finite-State_Machines"]}
