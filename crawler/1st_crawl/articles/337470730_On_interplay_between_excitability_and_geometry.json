{"id":"337470730_On_interplay_between_excitability_and_geometry","abstract":"Excitability is an intrinsic feature of a living matter. A commonly accepted feature of an excitable medium is that a local excitation leads to a propagation of circular or spiral excitation wave-fronts. This is indeed the case in fully excitable medium. However, with a decrease of an excitability localised wave-fragments emerge and propagate ballistically. Using FitzhHugh-Nagumo model we numerically study how excitation wave-fronts behave in a geometrically constrained medium and how the wave-fronts explore a random planar graph. We uncover how excitability controls propagation of excitation in angled branches, influences arrest of excitation entering a sudden expansion, and determines patterns of traversing of a random planar graph by an excitation waves.","authors":["Andrew Adamatzky"],"meta":["November 2019Bio Systems 187:104034","DOI:10.1016/j.biosystems.2019.104034"],"references":["332571173_Chemical_Excitable_Medium_in_Barcelona_Street_Network_as_a_Method_for_Panicked_Crowds_Behavior_Analysis","329331973_Mechanistic_insight_into_spontaneous_transition_from_cellular_alternans_to_arrhythmia-A_simulation_study","323269807_grapherator_A_Modular_Multi-Step_Graph_Generator","285850420_Electrical_Signals_in_Long-Distance_Communication_in_Plants","268228651_Electrical_spiking_in_bacterial_biofilms","231396364_Propagation_of_chemical_waves_through_capillary_tubes","22673187_Sodium_uptake_and_membrane_excitation_in_Paramecium","11162381_Mexican_Waves_in_an_Excitable_Medium","10731077_Critical_role_of_inhomogeneities_in_pacing_termination_of_cardiac_reentry","7513885_Reentry_wave_formation_in_excitable_media_with_stochastically_generated_inhomogeneities","331042231_Plant_leaf_computing","326381968_Street_map_analysis_with_excitable_chemical_medium","323714054_Wave_Propagation_in_Inhomogeneous_Excitable_Media","323144158_Initiation_of_Rotors_by_Fast_Propagation_Regions_in_Excitable_Media_A_Theoretical_Study","321608506_Excitable_Cells_in_Tissue_Culture","316698268_Reaction-Diffusion_Computers","286428036_Electrical_Long-Distance_Signaling_in_Plants","285605228_A_periodic_reaction_and_its_mechanism","255386477_Reaction-Diffusion_Computing","246127748_Excitation_of_a_Magnetic_Multilayer_by_an_Electric_Current","243698561_Excitation_of_Spin_Waves_in_a_Ferromagnet_by_a_Uniform_rf_Field","238782304_The_Transhyphal_Electrical_Current_of_Neuruspua_crassa_is_Carried_Principally_by_Protons","235801146_Emergence_of_Spiral_Wave_Activity_in_a_Mechanically_Heterogeneous_Reaction-Diffusion-Mechanics_System","234449991_The_excitation_of_plasma_waves_by_an_electromagnetic_wave_packet","231787858_Oscillatory_instabilities_of_multi-spike_patterns_for_the_one-dimensional_Gray-Scott_model","231630217_Logical_Functions_of_a_Cross_Junction_of_Excitable_Chemical_Media","228932189_Human_waves_in_stadiums","226144813_Experimental_Retracement_of_the_Origins_of_a_Protocell_It_was_Also_A_Protoneuron","223307716_Autocatalytic_reactions_in_the_isothermal_continuous_stirred_tank_reactor_Isolas_and_other_forms_of_multistability","222787197_Traveling_spike_autosolitons_in_the_Gray-Scott_model","222268788_Excitation_of_spin_waves_by_an_electric_current","45504358_Spiral_wave_breakup_in_excitable_media_with_an_inhomogeneity_of_conduction_anisotropy","24416871_Impulses_And_Physiological_States_In_Theoretical_Models_Of_Nerve_Membrane","23599664_The_updated_experimental_proteinoid_model","22758628_Ionic_Mechanisms_of_Excitation_in_Paramecium","22279830_Reconstruction_of_the_action_potential_of_ventricular_myocardial_fibres","19108535_Excitable_cell_made_of_thermal_proteinoids","18744593_Changes_of_Action_Potential_Shape_and_Velocity_for_Changing_Core_Conductor_Geometry","17214219_Membrane_potentials_in_Amoeba_proteus","16454785_Electrical_excitability_of_proteinoid_microspheres_composed_of_basic_and_acidic_proteinoids","16035614_Membrane_action_and_oscillatory_potentials_in_simulated_protocells","15949587_Electrical_membrane_phenomena_in_spherules_from_proteinoid_and_Lecithin","15272632_A_collocation-Galerkin_finite-element_model_cardiac_action-potential_propagation","14767299_Spiral_waves_of_excitation_underlie_reentrant_activity_in_isolated_cardiac_muscle","13508939_Slow_Conduction_in_Cardiac_Tissue_II_Effects_of_Branching_Tissue_Geometry","12859244_Dynamics_of_Intramural_Scroll_Waves_in_Three-dimensional_Continuous_Myocardium_with_Rotational_Anisotropy","10731066_Propagation_through_heterogeneous_substrates_in_simple_excitable_media_models","10551121_A_Quantitative_Description_Of_Membrane_Current_And_Its_Application_To_Conduction_And_Excitation_In_Nerve","9493766_Amino_acid_compositions_of_proteinoids","6540287_Electrical_signals_and_their_physiological_significance_in_plants","3474433_An_Active_Pulse_Transmission_Line_Simulating_A_Nerve_Axon","2838682_Numerical_Challenges_for_Resolving_Spike_Dynamics_for_Two_One-Dimensional_Reaction-Diffusion_Systems","2146786_Slowing_and_Stopping_of_Chemical_Waves_in_a_Narrowing_Canal"]}
