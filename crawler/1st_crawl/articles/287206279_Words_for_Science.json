{"id":"287206279_Words_for_Science","abstract":"In this article, we progress further into our semiological studies. We here sketch a procedure to include words in Science and a set of criteria to judge inclusion levels of those. Objectivity cannot be attained in Science if we do not choose our words extremely well: We choose the word heap and spend even millennia talking about the problem we have created, but if we had put more thought into the words we include in the scientific literature , we would actually not have a problem. We would have at most an allurement to show how many problems could be created in Science out of the freedom that common language terms allow us to have instead. A bit more thinking when designing a scientific problem and we will be able to optimize the distribution of investment in Science, what will then allow us to solve many more problems that matter.","authors":["Marcia Ricci Pinheiro"],"meta":["May 2015Indian Journal of Applied Research 5(5):19-22","Project: Paradoxes of Language"],"references":["200027561_The_Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy"]}
