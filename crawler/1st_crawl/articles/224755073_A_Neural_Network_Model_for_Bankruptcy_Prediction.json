{"id":"224755073_A_Neural_Network_Model_for_Bankruptcy_Prediction","abstract":"A neural network model is developed for prediction of bankruptcy,\nand it is tested using financial data from various companies. The same\nset of data is analyzed using a more traditional method of bankruptcy\nprediction, multivariate discriminant analysis. A comparison of the\npredictive abilities of both the neural network and the discriminant\nanalysis method is presented. The results show that neural networks\nmight be applicable to this problem","authors":["Marcus D.
