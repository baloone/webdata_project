{"id":"268079312_A_Guide_To_Deal_With_Uncertainties_In_Software_Project_Management","abstract":"Various project management approaches do not consider the impact that\nuncertainties have on the project. The identified threats by uncertainty in a\nprojec day-to-day are real and immediate and the expectations in a project are\noften high. The project manager faces a dilemma: decisions must be made in the\npresent about future situations which are inherently uncertain. The use of\nuncertainty management in project can be a determining factor for the project\nsuccess. This paper presents a systematic review about uncertainties management\nin software projects and a guide is proposed based on the review. It aims to\npresent the best practices to manage uncertainties in software projects in a\nstructured way including techniques and strategies to uncertainties\ncontainment.","authors":["Marcelo Luiz Monteiro Marinho","Suzana Sampaio","Telma Lima","Hermano Moura"],"meta":["November 2014International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology 6(5)","DOI:10.5121/ijcsit.2014.6501","SourcearXiv","Project: Uncertainty Management in Software Projects"],"references":["265106124_Managing_the_Unexpected_Resilient_Performance_in_an_Age_of_Uncertainty","247055303_One_Size_Does_Not_Fit_All_Projects_Exploring_Classical_Contingency_Domains","347492994_Managing_Project_Uncertainty","307630911_A_guide_to_project_management_body_of_knowledge_the_PMBOK_GuideR","286957927_Managing_the_Unknown_A_New_Approach_to_Managing_High_Uncertainty_and_Risk_in_Projects","275246444_Managing_Strategic_Surprise_by_Response_to_Weak_Signals","264357291_A_Comprehensive_Model_of_Uncertainty_Associated_with_Radical_Innovation","262206933_An_Approach_Related_to_Uncertainty_in_Software_Projects","261132246_Managing_complexity_in_technology_intensive_projects","246921080_Reinventing_project_management_The_diamond_approach_to_successful_growth_and_innovation"]}
