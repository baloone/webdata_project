{"id":"321799300_Challenges_in_Discriminating_Profanity_from_Hate_Speech","abstract":"In this study, we approach the problem of distinguishing general profanity from hate speech in social media, something which has not been widely considered. Using a new dataset annotated specifically for this task, we employ supervised classification along with a set of features that includes -grams, skip-grams and clustering-based word representations. We apply approaches based on single classifiers as well as more advanced ensemble classifiers and stacked generalisation, achieving the best result of accuracy for this 3-class classification task. Analysis of the results reveals that discriminating hate speech and profanity is not a simple task, which may require features that capture a deeper understanding of the text not always possible with surface -grams. The variability of gold labels in the annotated data, due to differences in the subjective adjudications of the annotators, is also an issue. Other directions for future work are discussed.","authors":["Shervin Malmasi","Marcos Zampieri"],"meta":["December 2017Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence 30(4):1-16","DOI:10.1080/0952813X.2017.1409284"],"references":["318741412_Legal_Framework_Dataset_and_Annotation_Schema_for_Socially_Unacceptable_Online_Discourse_Practices_in_Slovene","318739168_Abusive_Language_Detection_on_Arabic_Social_Media","313484584_On_combining_classifiers","307536780_A_Dictionary-based_Approach_to_Racism_Detection_in_Dutch_Social_Media","319770816_Combining_Pattern_Classifiers_Methods_and_Algorithms","318740851_Rephrasing_Profanity_in_Chinese_Text","318739472_A_Survey_on_Hate_Speech_Detection_using_Natural_Language_Processing","313745907_Experiments_with_a_new_boosting_algorithm_machine_learning","312638237_Abusive_Language_Detection_in_Online_User_Content","312250940_Are_You_a_Racist_or_Am_I_Seeing_Things_Annotator_Influence_on_Hate_Speech_Detection_on_Twitter"]}
