{"id":"331451078_Challenges_of_Integrated_Vehicle_Chassis_Control_Some_Findings_of_the_European_Project_EVE","abstract":"The development of high-performance mechatronic systems as well as the strong demand for environment-acceptable and safe intelligent technologies have had a profound impact on vehicle engineering. This impact has resulted in both an increasing degree of automation of vehicular systems and the emergence of new concepts like integrated chassis control. To contribute to this topic, a consortium of several industrial and academic partners from EU, South Africa, and USA has performed consolidated research and innovation actions for the development of new integrated chassis control technologies within the framework of the European project EVE. This paper presents the main EVE outcomes related to the integration of active brake, suspension, and tyre pressure control. Attention is also given to the problems of vehicle and tyre modelling, state estimation, robust chassis control, and experimental validation tools.","authors":["Valentin Ivanov","Dzmitry Savitski","Klaus Augsburg","Schalk Els"],"meta":["March 2019IEEJ Journal of Industry Applications 8(2):218-230","DOI:10.1541/ieejjia.8.218"],"references":["332170279_Kinematic_analysis_of_a_tyre_rolling_over_rough_terrain_using_digital_image_correlation","322201216_Shared_and_Distributed_X-in-the-Loop_Tests_for_Automotive_Systems_Feasibility_Study","313639798_Collaborative_Engineering_of_Integrated_Chassis_Control_for_Ground_Vehicle","310835123_Design_and_Simulation_of_the_Robust_ABS_and_ESP_Fuzzy_Logic_Controller_on_the_Complex_Braking_Maneuvers","324185928_Estimation_of_Vehicle_Tire-Road_Contact_Forces_A_Comparison_between_Artificial_Neural_Network_and_Observed_Theory_Approaches","322195386_A_semi-analytical_bearing_model_considering_outer_race_flexibility_for_model_based_bearing_load_monitoring","321986408_Individual_wheel_slip_control_using_decoupled_electro-hydraulic_brake_system","320850890_Design_and_Manufacturing_of_a_Clutch_and_Brake_System_for_Indoor_Tire_Testing","312623183_A_new_extension_of_the_Kalman_filter_to_nonlinear_systems","311458019_Comparison_of_Tire_Footprint_Measurement_Techniques"]}
