However, evidence supporting this democratization across countries is limited. We explored the question of MOOC democratization by conducting cross-national comparisons of gender differences in the enrollment in and completion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) MOOCs. We found that while females were less likely than males to enroll in STEM MOOCs, they were equally likely to complete them. Further, a higher probability to enroll in STEM MOOCs and smaller gender gaps in STEM MOOC enrollment and completion were found in less gender-equal and less economically developed countries.","authors":["Suhang Jiang","Katerina Schenke","Jacquelynne S Eccles","Di Xu"],"meta":["September 2018PLoS ONE 13(9):e0202463","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0202463"],"references":["326016867_The_role_of_teachers_classroom_experiences_and_finding_balance_Perspective_on_the_experiences_and_expectations_of_females_within_STEM_and_non-STEM_careers","323197652_The_Gender-Equality_Paradox_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_Education","311316953_Supporting_economically_disadvantaged_students_from_Nicaragua_in_STEM-C_fields","290475072_HarvardX_and_MITx_Two_Years_of_Open_Online_Courses_Fall_2012-Summer_2014","276859351_The_Online_STEM_Classroom--Who_Succeeds_An_Exploration_of_the_Impact_of_Ethnicity_Gender_and_Non-traditional_Student_Characteristics_in_the_Community_College_Context","288009703_Age_and_gender_differences_in_online_behavior_self-efficacy_and_academic_performance","287771101_Achievement_and_achievement_motives_psychological_and_sociological_approaches","287627604_Gender_and_Computers_Understanding_the_Digital_Divide","285628426_Democratizing_education_Examining_access_and_usage_patterns_in_massive_open_online_course","273075736_The_Incorporation_of_Women_into_Higher_Education_Paradoxical_Outcomes"]}
