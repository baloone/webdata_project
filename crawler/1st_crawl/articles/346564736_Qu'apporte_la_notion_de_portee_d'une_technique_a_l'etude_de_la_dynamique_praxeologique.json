We look at educational institutions as dynamic systems where praxeologies exist only as a result of a praxeological dynamic. In this article, we study some aspects of praxeological dynamics using, in particular, the notion of technique reach (theoretical, pragmatic and institutional) and competition between techniques. Two case studies illustrate praxeological dynamics concerning the study of the resolution of second-degree equations in the French educational system. One of the contributions of this article is to provide tools for curriculum analysis and textbooks.","authors":["Hamid Chaachoua","Annie Bessot","Danielly Kaspary"],"meta":["December 2020","Project: Developpements in the praxeological model"],"references":[]}
