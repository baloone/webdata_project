{"id":"262233701_Algebra-Coalgebra_Duality_in_Brzozowski's_Minimization_Algorithm","abstract":"We give a new presentation of Brzozowski's algorithm to minimize finite automata using elementary facts from universal algebra and coalgebra and building on earlier work by Arbib and Manes on a categorical presentation of Kalman duality between reachability and observability. This leads to a simple proof of its correctness and opens the door to further generalizations. Notably, we derive algorithms to obtain minimal language equivalent automata from Moore nondeterministic and weighted automata.","authors":["Filippo Bonchi","Marcello Bonsangue","Helle H.
