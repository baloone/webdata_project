{"id":"322502411_Marker-Based_Registration_for_Large_Deformations_-_Application_to_Open_Liver_Surgery","abstract":"This paper introduces an Augmented Reality (AR) system for open liver surgery. Although open surgery remains the gold-standard for the treatment of complex tumors and central lesions, technological issues actually prevent using AR with sufficient accuracy for clinical use. We propose a markers-based method allowing for the tracking and the deformation of a preoperative model in real-time during the surgery. Markers are manually placed on the surface of the organ after opening the abdominal cavity, and tracked in real-time by a set of infrared cameras. Our framework is composed of both a non-rigid initial registration method, providing an estimation of the location of the markers in the preoperative model, and a real-time tracking algorithm to deform the model during the surgery (even for large deformation or partial occlusion of the organ). The method is validated on both synthetic and ex-vivo samples; in addition, we demonstrate its applicability in the operating room during a liver resection surgery on a human patient. Preliminary studies provided promising results to improve the location of tumors, and to help surgeons into planning the ideal resection intraoperatively.","authors":["Yinoussa Adagolodjo","Nicolas Golse","Vibert Eric","Michel De Mathelin"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1109/ICRA.2018.8462909","Conference: IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRAAt: Brisbane, Australia","Project: CONECT: Couplage de la rObotique et de la simulatioN médicale pour des proCédures auTomatisées"],"references":["319132350_Augmented_reality_in_a_tumor_resection_model","317008417_Deformation_Correction_for_Image_Guided_Liver_Surgery_An_Intraoperative_Fidelity_Assessment","281195082_Patient-Specific_Biomechanical_Modeling_for_Guidance_During_Minimally-Invasive_Hepatic_Surgery","262194065_Real-time_3D_image_reconstruction_guidance_in_liver_resection_surgery","261735091_Constraint-Based_Simulation_for_Non-Rigid_Real-Time_Registration","260040865_Stereoscopic_augmented_reality_for_laparoscopic_surgery","258428269_Anatomy_of_the_liver_An_outline_with_three_levels_of_complexity_-_A_further_step_towards_tailored_territorial_liver_resections","235919738_Stable_Real-Time_Deformations","234048519_Simulation_of_Pneumoperitoneum_for_Laparoscopic_Surgery_Planning","232221911_Importance_of_conserving_middle_hepatic_vein_distal_branches_for_homogeneous_regeneration_of_the_left_liver_after_right_hepatectomy","49705058_Anatomical_changes_due_to_pneumoperitoneum_analyzed_by_MRI_An_experimental_study_in_pigs","29603838_Efficient_Physically_Plausible_Finite_Elements","2531050_Stable_Real-Time_Deformations","321821329_Silhouette-based_pose_estimation_for_deformable_organs_application_to_surgical_augmented_reality","319537729_Silhouette-based_Pose_Estimation_for_Deformable_Organs_Application_to_Surgical_Augmented_Reality","312288203_Using_contours_as_boundary_conditions_for_elastic_registration_during_minimally_invasive_hepatic_surgery","311097177_Surgery_of_Colorectal_Liver_Metastases_Pushing_the_Limits","310828123_Global_cancer_statistics_Cancer","304007212_Drop-out_between_the_two_liver_resections_of_two-stage_hepatectomy_Patient_selection_or_loss_of_chance","298340327_Colorectal_liver_metastases_disappearing_lesions_in_the_era_of_Eovist_hepatobiliary_magnetic_resonance_imaging","295800977_Deformation_Estimation_of_Elastic_Bodies_Using_Multiple_Silhouette_Images_for_Endoscopic_Image_Augmentation","294423383_Automatic_Localization_of_Endoscope_in_Intraoperative_CT_Image_A_Simple_Approach_to_Augmented_Reality_Guidance_in_Laparoscopic_Surgery","286507878_Model-Based_Identification_of_Anatomical_Boundary_Conditions_in_Living_Tissues","274086448_Improving_Echo-Guided_Procedures_Using_an_Ultrasound-CT_Image_Fusion_System","267871756_Physics-based_shape_matching_for_intraoperative_image_guidance","261860830_Augmented_Reality_Image_Overlay_Projection_for_Image_Guided_Open_Liver_Ablation_of_Metastatic_Liver_Cancer","259807434_Real-time_simulation_of_contact_and_cutting_of_heterogeneous_soft-tissues","236919034_Augmented_environments_for_the_targeting_of_hepatic_lesions_during_image-guided_robotic_liver_surgery","51423109_Robust_surface_registration_using_salient_anatomical_features_for_image-guided_liver_surgery_Algorithm_and_validation","20324277_Peroperative_ultrasonography_in_the_surgery_of_hepatic_tumours","7973532_Global_Cancer_Statistics_2002","6611622_Remnant_Liver_Volume_to_Body_Weight_Ratio_05_A_New_Cut-Off_to_Estimate_Postoperative_Risks_after_Extended_Resection_in_Noncirrhotic_Liver"]}
