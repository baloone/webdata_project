{"id":"241993115_The_Particle-in-Cell_Method_for_Hydrodynamic_Calculations","abstract":"This report supersedes LAMS-1956 and LAMS-2052. A method is presented ; for solving hydrodynamic problems involving large distortions and compressions of ; the fluid in several space dimensions. The calculation proce- dure ; introduces finite difference approximations to the differential equations; the ; solution in practice is carried out by means of high-speed electronic computers. ; The characteristics of the method are discussed and these are illustrated by ; presenting results of representative calculations.
