The authors present compare between popular microcontrollers particularl useful for the designed textronic applications. The authors focused on the design and description of a non-invasive system of health monitoring, which extends traditional clothing functions. In the paper the noises in signal lines of the textronic system are presented.","authors":["Marcjan NOWAK"],"meta":["December 2015Przeglad Elektrotechniczny 1(12):178-180","DOI:10.15199/48.2015.12.45"],"references":["276037203_Preliminary_Investigations_into_the_Development_of_Textile_Based_Temperature_Sensor_for_Healthcare_Applications"]}
