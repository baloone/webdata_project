{"id":"336078764_Observer_based_leader-following_consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_nonuniform_sampled_position_data","abstract":"This paper deals with the leader-following consensus problem of multi-agent systems with the consideration that each agent can only transmit its position state to the neighbors at irregular discrete sampling times. In the proposed algorithm, a continuous-discrete time observer is designed for the continuous estimation of both position and velocity from the discrete position information of the neighbors. These estimated states are then used for designing a continuous control law which solves the leader-following consensus problem. Moreover, the dynamics of the leader is not fixed and can be controlled through an external input. The stability analysis has been carried out by employing the Lyapunov approach which provides sufficient conditions to tune the parameters according to the maximum allowable sampling period. The developed algorithm has been simulated and then tested on an actual multi-robot system consisting of three differential drive wheeled robots. Both simulation and hardware results validate the effectiveness of the control algorithm.","authors":["Syed Ali Ajwad","Tomas MÃ©nard","Emmanuel Moulay","Michael Defoort"],"meta":["September 2019Journal of the Franklin Institute 356(16)","DOI:10.1016/j.jfranklin.2019.09.025"],"references":["330054238_Observer-based_consensus_for_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_arbitrary_asynchronous_and_aperiodic_sampling_periods","328237020_Average-consensus_Tracking_of_Multi-agent_Systems_with_Additional_Interconnecting_Agents","322213806_A_Decentralized_Coordination_Control_Method_for_Parallel_Bidirectional_Power_Converters_in_a_Hybrid_ACDC_Microgrid","321781469_Satellite_Formation-Containment_Flying_Control_with_Collision_Avoidance","312459477_Apollo_Scalable_and_coordinated_scheduling_for_cloud-scale_computing","329022306_Consensus_Seeking_of_Multi-agent_Systems_with_Intermittent_Communication_A_Persistent-hold_Control_Strategy","327098788_Sliding-mode_consensus_algorithms_for_disturbed_second-order_multi-agent_systems","320368172_Distributed_control_of_multi-agent_systems_over_unknown_communication_networks_using_extremum_seeking","319748327_Optimal_convergence_speed_of_consensus_under_constrained_damping_for_multi-agent_systems_with_discrete-time_double-integrator_dynamics","315649174_Leader-Following_Consensus_of_Nonlinear_Discrete-Time_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Limited_Communication_Channel_Capacity"]}
