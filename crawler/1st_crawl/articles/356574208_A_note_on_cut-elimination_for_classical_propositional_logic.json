{"id":"356574208_A_note_on_cut-elimination_for_classical_propositional_logic","abstract":"In Schwichtenberg (Studies in logic and the foundations of mathematics, vol 90, Elsevier, pp 867–895, 1977), Schwichtenberg fine-tuned Tait’s technique (Tait in The syntax and semantics of infinitary languages, Springer, pp 204–236, 1968) so as to provide a simplified version of Gentzen’s original cut-elimination procedure for first-order classical logic (Gallier in Logic for computer science: foundations of automatic theorem proving, Courier Dover Publications, London, 2015). In this note we show that, limited to the case of classical propositional logic, the Tait–Schwichtenberg algorithm allows for a further simplification. The procedure offered here is implemented on Kleene’s sequent system G4 (Kleene in Mathematical logic, Wiley, New York, 1967; Smullyan in First-order logic, Courier corporation, London, 1995). The specific formulation of the logical rules for G4 allows us to provide bounds on the height of cut-free proofs just in terms of the logical complexity of their end-sequent.","authors":["Gabriele Pulcini"],"meta":["November 2021Archive for Mathematical Logic","DOI:10.1007/s00153-021-00800-8"],"references":["225553171_Normal_derivability_in_classical_logic","344552720_Basic_Proof_Theory","247931462_Logic_for_Computer_Science_Foundations_of_Automatic_Theorem_Proving","227182269_Gentzen-Type_Systems_Resolution_And_Tableaux","33030380_Proof_Theory_Some_Applications_of_Cut-Elimination"]}
