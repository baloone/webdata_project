{"id":"232604677_Where_Are_All_the_Women_Gender_Differences_in_Participation_in_Physical_Science_and_Engineering","abstract":"Women continue to be underrepresented in programs in physical science and engineering and on the university and college faculties in all of the natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics. Why? Our analyses suggest that the main source of gender differences in entry into physical science and engineering occupations is not gender differences in either math aptitude or a sense of personal efficacy to succeed at these occupations, rather it is a gender difference in the value placed on different types of occupations. Furthermore, our results suggest that these differences begin influencing educational decisions quite early in life. Finally, my own opinion is that these differences reflect, at least to some extent, inaccurate stereotypes about physical science and engineering that lead some young women and men to reject these careers for the wrong reasons. Many jobs in these fields do provide opportunities for individuals to fulfill humanistic and helping values. If we want to increase the number of females who aspire to and then actually go into these fields, we need to provide them with better information about the nature of these occupations so that they can make better informed decisions regarding the full range of occupations they might consider as they try to pick a career that fits well with their personal values and identity as well as their short- and long-term goals.
