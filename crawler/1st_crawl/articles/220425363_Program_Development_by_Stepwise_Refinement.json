{"id":"220425363_Program_Development_by_Stepwise_Refinement","abstract":"The creative activity of programming—to be distinguished from coding—is usually taught by examples serving to exhibit certain techniques. It is here considered as a sequence of design decisions concerning the decomposition of tasks into subtasks and of data into data structures. The process of successive refinement of specifications is illustrated by a short but nontrivial example, from which a number of conclusions are drawn regarding the art and the instruction of programming.","authors":["Niklaus Wirth"],"meta":["April 1971Communications of the ACM 14(4):221-227","DOI:10.1145/357980.358010","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226623697_Programming_by_Action_Clusters","225828317_A_constructive_approach_to_the_problem_of_program_correctness","213881760_Notes_on_Structured_Programming"]}
