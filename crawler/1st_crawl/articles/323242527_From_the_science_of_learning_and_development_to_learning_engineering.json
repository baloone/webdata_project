{"id":"323242527_From_the_science_of_learning_and_development_to_learning_engineering","abstract":"In this issue, Cantor and colleagues synthesize a broad representation of the literature on the science of learning, and how learning changes over the course of development. Their perspective highlights three important factors about the emerging field of science of learning and development: (1) that it draws insights from increasingly diverse fields of research inquiry, from neuroscience and social science to computer science and adversity science; (2) that it provides a means to understand principles that generalize across learners, and yet also allow individual differences in learning to emerge and inform; and (3) that it recognizes that learning occurs in context, and is thus a shared responsibility between the learner, the instructor, and the environment. Here I discuss how this complex systems dynamical perspective can be integrated with the emerging framework of ‘learning engineering’ to provide a blueprint for significant innovations in education.","authors":["Melina R Uncapher"],"meta":["February 2018Applied Developmental Science 23(4):1-4","DOI:10.1080/10888691.2017.1421437","Project: Project iLEAD: Longitudinal, large-scale, in school study of executive function and academic achievement in middle childhood"],"references":["322691680_Malleability_plasticity_and_individuality_How_children_learn_and_develop_in_context_1","279302015_Promoting_an_Open_Research_Culture","323242775_Breakthrough_Leadership_in_the_Digital_Age_Using_Learning_Science_to_Reboot_Schooling","312303323_The_Specificity_Principle_in_Acculturation_Science","271922216_Boundary_as_Bridge_An_Analysis_of_the_Educational_Neuroscience_Literature_from_a_Boundary_Perspective","264342146_The_Science_of_the_Individual"]}
