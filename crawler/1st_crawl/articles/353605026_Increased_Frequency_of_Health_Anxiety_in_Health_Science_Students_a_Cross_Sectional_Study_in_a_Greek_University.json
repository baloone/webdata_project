{"id":"353605026_Increased_Frequency_of_Health_Anxiety_in_Health_Science_Students_a_Cross_Sectional_Study_in_a_Greek_University","abstract":"Background: \nEctopic Health Sciences students often experience higher level of stress due to clinical knowledge, and it has been reported that they frequently develop worries and symptoms of illness. These observations had lead to the hypothesis that studying health sciences may increase the risk for developing health anxiety.\n\nObjective: \nTo investigate the correlation between studying health sciences and health anxiety risk in students of a Greek university.\n\nMethods: \nA cross-sectional study was conducted among health science and non-health science students from the University of Thessaly, Greece. The 14 item - Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) was used to measure students' health anxiety. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to test the hypothesis.\n\nResults: \nThe population sample consisted of 562 health science students and 204 agriculture and computer science students. The prevalence of health anxiety (SHAI score >14) was 18.1% (95% CI 15.4%-21.1%) while 8.3% (95% CI 6.4%-10.5%) of the participants suffered from clinical health anxiety (SHAI score >18). Health science students had higher SHAI scores compared to non-health science students. Multivariable analysis revealed an increased risk for health anxiety in health science students (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.02-3.97, p=0.044). Health anxiety was also associated with sex (female) (p<0,008) and the presence of health anxiety in a family member (p<0,001).\n\nConclusion: \nThe current study identified studying health sciences as a determinant of health anxiety in students of a Greek university, after considering several confounding factors. This relatively neglected hypothesis should be further examined, preferably in a prospective cohort design.","authors":["Androniki Papadopoulou","Michalis Koureas","Alexandros Farmakis","Argyro Sirakouli"],"meta":["July 2021Medical Archives 75(3):221-228","DOI:10.5455/medarh.2021.75.221-228"],"references":["335875607_Prevalence_of_hypochondriac_symptoms_among_health_science_students_in_China_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","271609661_Relationship_between_Type_A_Personality_and_Mental_Health","264201582_Medical_student_syndrome_fact_or_fiction_A_cross-sectional_study","233389626_The_impact_of_medical_education_on_psychological_health_of_students_A_cohort_study","230767393_Declining_health_anxiety_throughout_medical_studies_It_is_mainly_about_a_more_relaxed_perception_of_the_health-related_concerns","45284327_Reassuring_the_medical_students'_disease_-_Health_related_anxiety_among_medical_students","257755788_Attribution_of_Somatic_Symptoms_in_Hypochondriasis","233940950_The_Short_Health_Anxiety_Inventory_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","222430625_Health_anxiety_and_cognitive_interference_Evidence_from_the_application_of_a_modified_Stroop_task_in_two_studies","19197969_Hypochondriacal_fears_and_beliefs_in_medical_and_law_students","11216408_The_Health_Anxiety_Inventory_Development_and_validation_of_scales_for_the_measurement_of_health_anxiety_and_hypochondriasis","18784588_Medical_Students'_Disease_Hypochondriasis_in_Medical_Education","13640555_Health_anxiety_in_medical_students","11854370_Redefining_medical_students'_disease_to_reduce_morbidity","11283765_Disease_anxiety_in_medical_students_and_law_students"]}
