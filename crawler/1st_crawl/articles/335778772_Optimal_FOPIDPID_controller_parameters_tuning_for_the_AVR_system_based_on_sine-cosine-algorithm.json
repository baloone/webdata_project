The FOPID controller is designed by SCA optimization technique using the time domain objective function for AVR system.\nThe SCA technique is responsible to optimize five parameters of FOPID controller based on minimum value of objective function of the controller design. The proposed SCA-FOPID controller is design at a global optimum of objective function is acheived.\nThen, the AVR system has good regulation of terminal voltage at the output to meet desired performance. The proposed method has a good reference tracking ability and frequency responses. This method is compared with the PID and FOPID controller designs of AVR system in the recent years, the proposed SCA-FOPID controller gives an excellent performance from the extensive simulations studies.","authors":["Jailsingh Bhookya","Ravi Kumar Jatoth"],"meta":["December 2019Evolutionary Intelligence 12(2)","DOI:10.1007/s12065-019-00290-x"],"references":["332435594_Improved_Gbest_artificial_bee_colony_algorithm_for_the_constraints_optimization_problems","332383599_Improved_Kidney-inspired_Algorithm_Approach_for_Tuning_of_PID_Controller_in_AVR_System","331472367_Differential_evolution_algorithm_tuned_tilt_integral_derivative_controller_with_filter_controller_for_automatic_generation_control","325875075_A_Novel_Performance_Criterion_Approach_to_Optimum_Design_of_PID_Controller_Using_Cuckoo_Search_Algorithm_for_AVR_System","321821206_Optimal_tuning_of_fractional_order_PID_controller_for_AVR_system_using_simulated_annealing_optimization_algorithm","332386996_PID_CONTROLLER_DESIGN_FOR_DECENTRALIZED_TITO_PROCESS_USING_MODIFIED_DIFFERENTIAL_EVOLUTION_ALGORITHM","330429654_Jaya_Algorithm-Optimized_PID_Controller_for_AVR_System_Proceedings_of_the_3rd_International_Conference_on_Intelligent_Interactive_Systems_and_Applications_IISA2018","324408883_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_PID_Controller_Design_for_AVR_Based_on_Optimization_Techniques","320440477_New_optimal_controller_tuning_method_for_an_AVR_system_using_a_simplified_Ant_Colony_Optimization_with_a_new_constrained_Nelder-Mead_algorithm","320374224_Hybridizing_sine_cosine_algorithm_with_differential_evolution_for_global_optimization_and_object_tracking","317977273_Fractional-order_PID_control_of_a_chopper-fed_DC_motor_drive_using_a_novel_firefly_algorithm_with_dynamic_control_mechanism","315371047_Optimization_of_Fractional_Order_PID_Controller_Using_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer","312571851_Designing_of_the_PID_and_FOPID_controllers_using_conventional_tuning_techniques","312392001_Fractional_Order_PID_Control_of_Rotor_Suspension_by_Active_Magnetic_Bearings","307800644_Implementation_of_fractional_order_PID_controller_for_an_AVR_system"]}
