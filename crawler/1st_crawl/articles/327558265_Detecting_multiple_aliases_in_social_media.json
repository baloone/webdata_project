{"id":"327558265_Detecting_multiple_aliases_in_social_media","abstract":"Monitoring and analysis of web forums is becoming\nimportant for intelligence analysts around the globe since terrorists\nand extremists are using forums for spreading propaganda\nand communicating with each other. Various tools for analyzing\nthe content of forum postings and identifying aliases that need\nfurther inspection by analysts have been proposed throughout\nliterature, but a problem related to this is that individuals can\nmake use of several aliases. In this paper we propose a number\nof matching techniques for detecting forum users who make use\nof multiple aliases. By combining different techniques such as\ntime profiling and stylometric analysis of messages the accuracy\nof recognizing users with multiple aliases increases, as shown in\nexperiments conducted on the ICWSM dataset boards.ie.","authors":["Amendra Shrestha","Lisa Kaati","Fredrik Johansson"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1145/2492517.2500261","Conference: IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and MiningAt: Niagara, Ontario, Canada","Project: Multiple Aliases"],"references":["308073726_Authorship_attribution","274417440_Writeprints_A_Stylometric_Approach_to_Identity-level_Identification_and_Similarity_Detection_in_Cyberspace","273658111_Harvesting_and_analysis_of_weak_signals_for_detecting_lone_wolf_terrorists","264821994_Analysing_the_presence_of_school-shooting_related_communities_at_social_media_sites","262400443_JGAAP_A_System_for_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Authorship_Attribution","261312937_Combining_Entity_Matching_Techniques_for_Detecting_Extremist_Behavior_on_Discussion_Boards","316754069_Understanding_Lone_Wolf_Terrorism","289208572_Lone_wolf_terror_and_the_rise_of_leaderless_resistance","262404579_Anonymous_Web_Transactions_with_Crowds","254044417_On_the_Feasibility_of_Internet-Scale_Author_Identification","248947872_Mechanisms_of_Political_Radicalization_Pathways_Toward_Terrorism","247927896_Emerging_Topic_Detection_on_Twitter_based_on_Temporal_and_Social_Terms_Evaluation","247751861_The_Columbine_LegacyRampage_Shootings_as_Political_Acts","252029617_Extended_approximate_string_matching_algorithms_to_detect_name_aliases","244446479_UNIMATCH_A_Record_Linkage_System"]}
