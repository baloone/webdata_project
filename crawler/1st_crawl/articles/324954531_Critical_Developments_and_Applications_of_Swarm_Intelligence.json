{"id":"324954531_Critical_Developments_and_Applications_of_Swarm_Intelligence","abstract":"Artificial intelligence is a constantly advancing field that requires models in order to accurately create functional systems. The use of natural acumen to create artificial intelligence creates a field of research in which the natural and the artificial meet in a new and innovative way. Critical Developments and Applications of Swarm Intelligence is a critical academic publication that examines developing research, technologies, and function regarding natural and artificial acumen specifically, in regards to self-organized systems. Featuring coverage on a broad range of topics such as evolutionary algorithms, optimization techniques, and computational comparison, this book is geared toward academicians, students, researchers, and engineers seeking relevant and current research on the progressive research based on the implementation of swarm intelligence in self-organized systems.","authors":["Y.
