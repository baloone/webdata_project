{"id":"228739320_Partial_metric_monoids_and_semivaluation_spaces","abstract":"Stable partial metric spaces (or the equivalent invariant weightable quasi-metric spaces) form a fundamental concept in Quantitative Do-main Theory. Indeed, all domains have been shown to be quantifiable via a stable partial metric (e.g. [22], [23], [26]). Monoid operations arise in Domain Theory in the context of power domains. These oper-ations also arise naturally in a quantitative context and play a crucial role in several applications. This has motivated our study of par-tial metric monoids and quantitative monoids. The study of monoids in Domain Theory is gaining momentum. We remark that Jimmy Lawson has advocated the study of idempotent analysis (diods) in a domain theoretic context at the recent Domains Workshop in Birm-ingham. Here, we show that the structure of a stable partial met-ric monoid provides a suitable framework for a unified approach to some interesting examples of monoids, such as the interval domain, the domain of words and the dual complexity space. We also intro-duce the notion of a semivaluation monoid and show that there is a bijection between stable partial metric monoids and semivaluation monoids, extending the correspondence theorem of [22] to the context of monoids. Our results consist of a first exploration of the interest-ing topic of monoids on quantitative domains and relationships with Lawson's program of idempotent analysis in Domain Theory will be explored in future work.","authors":["Salvador Romaguera","Michel Schellekens"],"meta":["December 2005Topology and its Applications 153(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.topol.2005.01.023"],"references":["292788077_PCF_extended_with_real_numbers_a_domain-theoretic_approach_to_higher-order_exact_real_number_computation","222478359_PCF_extended_with_real_numbers","277281464_Lattice_Theory","277065078_Probabilistic_Non-Determinism","268018700_Quasi-Uniform_Spaces","266220170_Nonsymmetric_topology","265461921_Nonsymmetric_Distances_and_Their_Associated_Topologies_About_the_Origins_of_Basic_Ideas_in_the_Area_of_Asymmetric_Topology","262348269_Totally_bounded_spaces_and_compact_ordered_spaces_as_domains_of_computation","252065115_The_Semantics_of_a_Simple_Language_for_Parallel_Processing","239066966_PCF_extended_with_real_numbers_A_domain-theoretic_approach_to_higher-order_exact_real_number_computation","230595875_Lattice_Theory","228600857_Uniformities_on_Free_Semigroups","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology","227183993_C-complete_quasi-uniform_spaces","225563450_Lengths_on_semigroups_and_groups","223052592_The_Smyth_Completion_A_Common_Foundation_for_Denotational_Semantics_and_Complexity_Analysis","223001960_A_characterization_of_partial_metrizability_Domains_are_quantifiable","222722236_Ordered_fractal_semigroups_as_a_model_of_computation","222181140_The_correspondence_between_partial_metrics_and_semivaluations","221329680_The_Semantics_of_Simple_Language_for_Parallel_Programming","220800051_Towards_Computing_Distances_Between_Programs_via_Scott_Domains","220154993_An_Extensional_Treatment_of_Lazy_Data_Flow_Deadlock","2862740_On_Upper_Weightable_Spaces","2853596_Quasi-metric_Properties_of_Complexity_Spaces","2838881_The_Quasi-Metric_of_Complexity_Convergence","2513449_Approximation_of_Metric_Spaces_by_Partial_Metric_Spaces"]}
