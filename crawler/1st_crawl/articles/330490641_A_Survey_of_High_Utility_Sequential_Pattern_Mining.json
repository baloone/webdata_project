{"id":"330490641_A_Survey_of_High_Utility_Sequential_Pattern_Mining","abstract":"The problem of mining high utility sequences aims at discovering subsequences having a high utility (importance) in a quantitative sequential database. This problem is a natural generalization of several other pattern mining problems such as discovering frequent itemsets in transaction databases, frequent sequences in sequential databases, and high utility itemsets in quantitative transaction databases. To extract high utility sequences from a quantitative sequential database, the sequential ordering between items and their utility (in terms of criteria such as purchase quantities and unit profits) are considered. High utility sequence mining has been applied in numerous applications. It is much more challenging than the aforementioned problems due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space when considering sequences, and because the utility measure of sequences does not satisfy the downward-closure property used in pattern mining to reduce the search space. This chapter introduces the problem of high utility sequence mining, the state-of-art algorithms, applications, present related problems and research opportunities. A key contribution of the chapter is to also provide a theoretical framework for comparing upper-bounds used by high utility sequence mining algorithms. In particular, an interesting result is that an upper-bound used by the popular USpan algorithm is not an upper-bound. The consequence is that USpan is an incomplete algorithm, and potentially other algorithms extending USpan.","authors":["Tin C Truong","Philippe Fournier Viger"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-04921-8_4","In book: High-Utility Pattern Mining: Theory, Algorithms and Applications (pp.97-129)","Projects: Novel algorithms for sequence mining, sequence prediction and utility pattern miningUtility Pattern Mining"],"references":["319212715_TWINCLE_A_Low-Cost_Sequential_Rule_Mining_Algorithm_for_Event_Logs","318990970_Mining_of_high_utility-probability_sequential_patterns_from_uncertain_databases","318857473_High-Utility_Sequential_Pattern_Mining_with_Multiple_Minimum_Utility_Thresholds","314071974_Mining_Periodic_High_Utility_Sequential_Patterns","313827287_FCloSM_FGenSM_two_efficient_algorithms_for_mining_frequent_closed_and_generator_sequences_using_the_local_pruning_strategy","300783058_Efficient_Mining_of_High-Utility_Sequential_Rules","290197992_On_efficiently_mining_high_utility_sequential_patterns","278708870_Fast_Vertical_Mining_of_Sequential_Patterns_Using_Co-occurrence_Information","275243808_CRoM_and_HuspExt_Improving_Efficiency_of_High_Utility_Sequential_Pattern_Extraction","225266300_Zaki_MJ_SPADE_An_efficient_algorithm_for_mining_frequent_sequences_Machine_Learning_421_31-60","320867565_Efficient_algorithms_for_simultaneously_mining_concise_representations_of_sequential_patterns_based_on_extended_pruning_conditions","319445692_TWINCLE_A_Constrained_Sequential_Rule_Mining_Algorithm_for_Event_Logs","315944785_Efficiently_mining_high_utility_sequential_patterns_in_static_and_streaming_data","315500803_Mining_High_Utility_Sequential_Patterns_with_Negative_Item_Values","313451493_Distributed_and_parallel_high_utility_sequential_pattern_mining","312571510_Top-k_utility-based_gene_regulation_sequential_pattern_discovery","301455478_A_Novel_Approach_for_Hiding_High_Utility_Sequential_Patterns","281995045_Efficient_Mining_of_High_Utility_Sequential_Pattern_from_Incremental_Sequential_Dataset","278665855_ClaSP_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Mining_Frequent_Closed_Sequences","271428711_Efficiently_Mining_Top-K_High_Utility_Sequential_Patterns","262375425_A_Novel_Approach_for_Mining_High-Utility_Sequential_Patterns_in_Sequence_Databases","262331621_Mining_high_utility_episodes_in_complex_event_sequences","261371353_Applying_the_maximum_utility_measure_in_high_utility_sequential_pattern_mining","254464338_USpan_An_efficient_algorithm_for_mining_high_utility_sequential_patterns","235949363_Mining_interesting_user_behavior_patterns_in_mobile_commerce_environments","221654436_Sequential_PAttern_mining_using_a_bitmap_representation","220908535_Mining_High_Utility_Web_Access_Sequences_in_Dynamic_Web_Log_Data","220895396_A_Two-Phase_Algorithm_for_Fast_Discovery_of_High_Utility_Itemsets","220787498_Mining_High_Utility_Mobile_Sequential_Patterns_in_Mobile_Commerce_Environments","2538180_Sequential_PAttern_Mining_using_A_Bitmap_Representation"]}
