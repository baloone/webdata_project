{"id":"306377033_A_Topological_Study_of_Chaotic_Iterations_Application_to_Hash_Functions","abstract":"Chaotic iterations, a tool formerly used in distributed computing, has recently revealed various interesting properties of disorder leading to its use in the computer science security field. In this paper, a comprehensive study of its topological behavior is proposed. It is stated that, in addition to being chaotic as defined in the Devaney's formulation, this tool possesses the property of topological mixing. Additionally, its level of sensibility, expansivity, and topological entropy are evaluated. All of these properties lead to a complete unpredictable behavior for the chaotic iterations. As it only manipulates binary digits or integers, we show that it is possible to use it to produce truly chaotic computer programs. As an application example, a truly chaotic hash function is proposed in two versions. In the second version, an artificial neural network is used, which can be stated as chaotic according to Devaney.","authors":["Christophe Guyeux","Jacques M.
