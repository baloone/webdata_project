{"id":"285580973_New_Concepts_of_Vague_Graphs","abstract":"The concept of vague graph was introduced by Ramakrishna in (2009). Since the vague models give more precision, flexibility, and compatibility to the system as compared to the classical and fuzzy models, in this paper, the concept of energy of fuzzy graph is extended to the energy of a vague graph. It has many applications in physics, chemistry, computer science, and other branches of mathematics. We defiï¿½ne adjacency matrix, degree matrix, laplacian matrix, spectrum, and energy of a vague graph in terms of their adjacency matrix. The spectrum of a vague graph appears in physics statistical problems, and combinatorial optimization problems in mathematics. Also, the lower and upper bounds for the energy of a vague graph are also derived. Finally, we give some applications of energy in vague graph and other sciences.","authors":["Rajabali Borzooei","Hossein Rashmanlou"],"meta":["August 2017International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics 8(4)","DOI:10.1007/s13042-015-0475-x","Project: Generalization of fuzzy graphs"],"references":["301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","283825841_Energy_of_a_dominating_intuitionistic_fuzzy_graph","280067009_Complete_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","280066105_Balanced_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","328900727_A_Combinatorial_Approach_to_Matrix_Theory_and_Its_Applications","292004369_Similar_relations_and_fuzzy_ordering","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","275605693_New_concepts_of_fuzzy_planar_graph","273176661_Fuzzy_Planar_Graphs","272794433_Energy_of_an_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Graph","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","272794077_Max-Min_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Matrix_of_an_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Graph"]}
