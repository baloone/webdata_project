{"id":"343449070_Some_new_local_fractional_inequalities_associated_with_generalized_s_m-convex_functions_and_applications","abstract":"Abstract Fractal analysis is one of interesting research areas of computer science and engineering, which depicts a precise description of phenomena in modeling. Visual beauty and self-similarity has made it an attractive field of research. The fractal sets are the effective tools to describe the accuracy of the inequalities for convex functions. In this paper, we employ linear fractals R α $\\mathbb{R}^{\\alpha }$ to investigate the ( s , m ) $(s,m)$ -convexity and relate them to derive generalized Hermite–Hadamard (HH) type inequalities and several other associated variants depending on an auxiliary result. Under this novel approach, we aim at establishing an analog with the help of local fractional integration. Meanwhile, we establish generalized Simpson-type inequalities for ( s , m ) $(s,m)$ -convex functions. The results in the frame of local fractional showed that among all comparisons, we can only see the correlation between novel strategies and the earlier consequences in generalized s-convex, generalized m-convex, and generalized convex functions. We obtain application in probability density functions and generalized special means to confirm the relevance and computational effectiveness of the considered method. Similar results in this dynamic field can also be widely applied to other types of fractals and explored similarly to what has been done in this paper.","authors":["Thabet Abdeljawad","Saima Rashid","Zakia Hammouch","Yuming Chu"],"meta":["August 2020Advances in Difference Equations 2020(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13662-020-02865-w"],"references":["343470458_ON_NEW_INEQUALITIES_OF_SIMPSON'S_TYPE_FOR_GENERALIZED_CONVEX_FUNCTIONS","342656908_Abdeljawad_et_al_Advances_in_Difference_Equations_On_new_fractional_integral_inequalities_for_p-convexity_within_interval-valued_functions","342541738_New_generalized_reverse_Minkowski_and_related_integral_inequalities_involving_generalized_fractional_conformable_integrals","341553821_Novel_Dynamic_Structures_of_2019-nCoV_with_Nonlocal_Operator_via_Powerful_Computational_Technique","339900749_Ostrowski_type_inequalities_in_the_sense_of_generalized_K-fractional_integral_operator_for_exponentially_convex_functions","337895250_Inequalities_by_Means_of_Generalized_Proportional_Fractional_Integral_Operators_with_Respect_to_Another_Function","341737765_Modelling_the_spread_of_COVID-19_with_new_fractal-fractional_operators_Can_the_lockdown_save_mankind_before_vaccination","340779451_Mathematical_analysis_of_a_fractional_differential_model_of_HBV_infection_with_antibody_immune_response","340470381_Modeling_and_forecasting_of_epidemic_spreading_The_case_of_Covid-19_and_beyond","338954129_A_numerical_study_of_the_non-linear_fractional_mathematical_model_of_tumor_cells_in_presence_of_chemotherapeutic_treatment"]}
