{"id":"345606288_Imitation_Game_Threshold_or_Watershed","abstract":"Showing remarkable insight into the relationship between language and thought, Alan Turing in 1950 proposed the Imitation Game as a proxy for the question “Can machines think?” and its meaning and practicality have been debated hotly ever since. The Imitation Game has come under criticism within the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence communities with leading scientists proposing alternatives, revisions, or even that the Game be abandoned entirely. Yet Turing’s imagined conversational fragments between human and machine are rich with complex instances of inference of implied information, reasoning from generalizations, and meta-reasoning, challenges AI practitioners have wrestled with since at least 1980 and continue to study. We argue that the very fact the Imitation Game is so difficult may be the very reason it shouldn’t be changed or abandoned. The semi-decidability of the game at this point hints at the possibility of a hard limit to the powers of technology.","authors":["Eric Neufeld","Sonje Finnestad"],"meta":["December 2020Minds and Machines 30(4):1-21","DOI:10.1007/s11023-020-09544-5"],"references":["339129437_In_defense_of_the_Turing_test","314118866_Why_being_dialogical_must_come_before_being_logical_the_need_for_a_hermeneutical-dialogical_approach_to_robotic_activities","313316010_Is_it_possible_to_grow_an_I-Thou_relation_with_an_artificial_agent_A_dialogistic_perspective","353964979_Human-Compatible_Artificial_Intelligence","330326702_Common_Sense_the_Turing_Test_and_the_Quest_for_Real_AI","317051647_A_probabilistic_anytime_algorithm_for_the_halting_problem","316801462_The_Logical_Foundations_of_Statistical_Interference","313097840_Minds_brains_and_programs","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","303031278_The_Mismeasure_of_Machines","292364628_Cognitive_Orthoses_Toward_Human-Centered_AI","283812826_Embodied_Intelligence","288687478_The_winograd_schema_challenge","275291363_The_Reference_Class","270150099_IMM_Introduction_to_metamathematics"]}
