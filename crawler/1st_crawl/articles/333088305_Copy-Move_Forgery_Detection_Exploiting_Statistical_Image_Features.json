{"id":"333088305_Copy-Move_Forgery_Detection_Exploiting_Statistical_Image_Features","abstract":"Majority of image manipulation identification methods attempt to find variation or dissimilarities in statistical image features. But such schemes do not identify in case of copy-move forgery type of image manipulation, because the forged region comes from the same image. In this chapter, we present a statistical image features-based copy-move forgery detection method. The mean value gives the pixel intensity of the entire image, and variance is used to find how each pixel intensity differs from its neighbors within a block. We evaluate and compare the presented algorithm with other existing methods through a comprehensive set of experiments. Our experimental results show that this technique achieves considerably higher detection accuracy as compared to the existing methods.","authors":["Aniket Roy","Rahul Dixit","Ruchira Naskar","Rajat Subhra Chakraborty"],"meta":["January 2020Studies in Computational Intelligence","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-7644-2_4","In book: Digital Image Forensics (pp.57-64)"],"references":["323348920_Copy-move_forgery_detection_exploiting_statistical_image_features","266927943_CoMoFoD_-New_Database_for_Copy-Move_Forgery_Detection","224366445_A_New_Approach_for_Detecting_Copy-Move_Forgery_in_Digital_Images","220734581_An_efficient_and_robust_method_for_detecting_copy-move_forgery","51544145_A_robust_detection_algorithm_for_copy-move_forgery_in_digital_images","313010856_Detection_of_Copy-Move_Forgery_in_Digital_Images","289896309_Digital_image_forgery_forensics_by_using_undecimated_dyadic_wavelet_transform_and_Zernike_moments","266007421_Passive_copy_move_image_forgery_detection_using_undecimated_dyadic_wavelet_transform","242578505_Usc-sipi_image_database_version_5","228694745_Exposing_Digital_Forgeries_by_Detecting_Duplicated_Image_Regions","222570638_Fast_automatic_and_fine-grained_tampered_JPEG_image_detection_via_DCT_coefficient_analysis","221195598_Identifying_Tampered_Regions_Using_Singular_Value_Decomposition_in_Digital_Image_Forensics","46218708_Improved_DCT-based_detection_of_copy-move_forgery_in_images"]}
