{"id":"283185711_FM-index_of_alignment_A_compressed_index_for_similar_strings","abstract":"In this paper we propose the FM-index of alignment, a compressed index for similar strings with the functionalities of pattern search and random access. For this, we first design a new and improved version of the suffix array of alignment. The FM-index of alignment is an FM-index of this suffix array of alignment. The FM-index of alignment supports the LF-mapping and backward search, the key functionalities of the FM-index, but the LF-mapping and backward search of our index is significantly more involved than the original FM-index. We implemented the FM-index of alignment and did experiments on 100 genome sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project. The index size of the FM-index of alignment is about a half of that of RLCSA due to MÃ¤kinen et al.","authors":["Joong Chae Na","Hyunjoon Kim","Heejin Park","Thierry Lecroq"],"meta":["August 2015Theoretical Computer Science 638","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2015.08.008"],"references":["268161689_Faster_Compressed_Suffix_Trees_for_Repetitive_Text_Collections","261770315_Hybrid_Indexes_for_Repetitive_Datasets","236651605_Suffix_Tree_of_Alignment_An_Efficient_Index_for_Similar_Data","229153100_A_public_resource_facilitating_clinical_use_of_genomes","224890567_A_map_of_human_genome_variation_from_population-scale_sequencing","224890400_Consortium_TGP_A_map_of_human_genome_variation_from_population-scale_sequencing_Nature_467_1061-1073","220430619_Indexing_compressed_text","3880914_Opportunistic_Data_Structures_with_Applications","313184847_A_universal_algorithm_for_sequential_data_compression","266586096_Indexing_Highly_Repetitive_Collections","261674312_Fast_Relative_Lempel-Ziv_Self-index_for_Similar_Sequences","259338888_Suffix_Array_of_Alignment_A_Practical_Index_for_Similar_Data","258279066_From_Theory_to_Practice_Plug_and_Play_with_Succinct_Data_Structures","257145027_On_Compressing_and_Indexing_Repetitive_Sequences","241693968_The_Human_Genome_Contracts_Again","238758003_A_universal_algorithm_for_data_compression","238176056_Algorithms_on_Strings_Trees_and_Strings","236147695_Compressed_Suffix_Trees_for_Repetitive_Texts","225682144_Indexing_Similar_DNA_Sequences","221579918_Relative_Lempel-Ziv_Compression_of_Genomes_for_Large-Scale_Storage_and_Retrieval","47935143_Storage_and_Retrieval_of_Individual_Genomes","43078874_Storage_and_Retrieval_of_Highly_Repetitive_Sequence_Collections","28360996_Run-Length_Compressed_Indexes_Are_Superior_for_Highly_Repetitive_Sequence_Collections","23461482_Human_Genomes_as_Email_Attachments","3082787_Lempel_A_A_Universal_Algorithm_for_Sequential_Data_Compression_IEEE_Transactions_on_Information_Theory_233_337-343","2702058_A_Block-Sorting_Lossless_Data_Compression_Algorithm","2385414_An_Experimental_Study_of_an_Opportunistic_Index"]}
