{"id":"318914952_Quantitative_Network_Monitoring_with_NetQRE","abstract":"In network management today, dynamic updates are required for traffic engineering and for timely response to security threats. Decisions for such updates are based on monitoring network traffic to compute numerical quantities based on a variety of network and application-level performance metrics. Today's state-of-the-art tools lack programming abstractions that capture application or session-layer semantics, and thus require network operators to specify and reason about complex state machines and interactions across layers. To address this limitation, we present the design and implementation of NetQRE, a high-level declarative toolkit that aims to simplify the specification and implementation of such quantitative network policies. NetQRE integrates regular-expression-like pattern matching at flow-level as well as application-level payloads with aggregation operations such as sum and average counts. We describe a compiler for NetQRE that automatically generates an efficient implementation with low memory footprint. Our evaluation results demonstrate that NetQRE allows natural specification of a wide range of quantitative network tasks ranging from detecting security attacks to enforcing application-layer network management policies. NetQRE results in high performance that is comparable with optimized manually-written low-level code and is significantly more efficient than alternative solutions, and can provide timely enforcement of network policies that require quantitative network monitoring.","authors":["Yifei Yuan","Dong Lin","Ankit Mishra","Sajal Marwaha"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1145/3098822.3098830","Conference: the Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group"],"references":["310821722_Network_Monitoring_as_a_Streaming_Analytics_Problem","288492418_Maple","279458588_Bohatei_Flexible_and_Elastic_DDoS_Defense","238621090_Composing_Software-Defined_Networks","221611922_Revisiting_the_Case_for_a_Minimalist_Approach_for_Network_Flow_Monitoring","220832000_Hedera_Dynamic_Flow_Scheduling_for_Data_Center_Networks","220565847_Anomaly_Detection_A_Survey","317595570_StreamQRE_modular_specification_and_efficient_evaluation_of_quantitative_queries_over_streaming_data","308338890_Regular_Programming_for_Quantitative_Properties_of_Data_Streams","305781177_SNAP_Stateful_Network-Wide_Abstractions_for_Packet_Processing","277679340_NetkAT","268198751_Chimera_A_Declarative_Language_for_Streaming_Network_Traffic_Analysis","266660067_DREAM_Dynamic_Resource_Allocation_for_Software-defined_Measurement","266007060_HILTI_An_Abstract_Execution_Environment_for_Concurrent_Stateful_Network_Traffic_Analysis","245662146_Cisco_Systems_NetFlow_Services_Export_Version_9","241277831_Software_defined_traffic_measurement_with_OpenSketch","228642038_Open_source_VoIP_traffic_monitoring","222822892_Anomaly-based_network_intrusion_detection_Techniques_systems_and_challenges","222497719_Bro_A_system_for_detecting_network_intruders_in_real-time_Computer_Networks_3123-24","221214087_Gigascope_A_Stream_Database_for_Network_Applications","221213696_TelegraphCQ_Continuous_Dataflow_Processing","221164225_ProgME_Towards_Programmable_Network_MEasurement","220900803_Snort_-_Lightweight_Intrusion_Detection_for_Networks","220862287_A_Network_in_a_Laptop_Rapid_Prototyping_for_Software-Defined_Networks","220428836_ProgME_Towards_Programmable_Network_MEasurement","220424067_Declarative_Networking","4066209_sFlow_Towards_Resource-Efficient_and_Agile_Service_Federation_in_Service_Overlay_Networks"]}
