{"id":"304249115_Motivational_factors_for_studying_science_and_engineering_in_beginning_students_The_case_of_academic_preparatory_programmes","abstract":"Academic preparatory programmes offer candidates who did not achieve high enough grades during their\nsecondary education, an opportunity to improve their chances of being accepted by universities and colleges. Using quantitative and qualitative tools, the study described in this article characterised the motivational factors for studying science and engineering among sixty beginning students in an academic preparatory programme in Israel. According to the findings, the students are motivated primarily by interest in studying science and engineering (intrinsic motivation) and by recognition of the value inherent to these studies (identified regulation). Nevertheless, alongside these factors, introjected regulation, according to which some of the students have undertaken these studies in order to fulfil the expectations of those who are important to them or for reasons of personal prestige, also bears considerable weight.","authors":["Aharon Gero","Gershon Abraham"],"meta":["June 2016Global Journal of Engineering Education 18(2):72-76"],"references":["292047086_High-school_course_on_engineering_design_Enhancement_of_students'_motivation_and_development_of_systems_thinking_skills","274775908_Improving_Intrinsic_Motivation_among_Sophomore_Electrical_Engineering_Students_by_an_Introductory_Project","271670509_Arendale_D_R_2005_Terms_of_endearment_Words_that_help_define_and_guide_developmental_education_Journal_of_College_Reading_and_Learning_352_66-82_Retrieved_from_httpfilesericedgovfulltextEJ689656pdf","271293267_Self-Esteem_and_Motivation_for_Learning_among_Minority_Students_A_Comparison_between_Students_of_Pre-Academic_and_Regular_Programs","255660302_Student_Services_Effective_Approaches_to_Retaining_Students_in_Higher_Education","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","294285215_Is_it_possible_to_increase_motivation_for_study_among_sophomore_electrical_and_computer_engineering_students","288545240_Correlation_between_students'_motivated_strategies_for_learning_and_academic_achievement_in_an_engineering_dynamics_course","272160008_The_Achieving_Society","264322729_An_Analysis_of_Motivation_Constructs_with_First-Year_Engineering_Students_Relationships_Among_Expectancies_Values_Achievement_and_Career_Plans"]}
