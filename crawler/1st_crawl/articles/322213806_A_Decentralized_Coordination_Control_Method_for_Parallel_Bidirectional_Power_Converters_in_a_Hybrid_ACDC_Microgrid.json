{"id":"322213806_A_Decentralized_Coordination_Control_Method_for_Parallel_Bidirectional_Power_Converters_in_a_Hybrid_ACDC_Microgrid","abstract":"In the hybrid ac/dc microgrid, the ac and dc subgrids are connected by bidirectional power converters (BPCs) that play an important role in the load power sharing and power interaction between the ac and dc subgrids. The coordination control and circulating current suppression for the parallel BPC system are very challenging. In this paper, a decentralized coordination control method is proposed for parallel three-phase BPCs, which can suppress the circulating currents, realize proper power interaction and achieve overall load power sharing in both the grid-connected mode and the islanded mode. The performance of the proposed control methods is verified by the real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests.","authors":["Pengcheng Yang","Yanghong Xia","Miao Yu","Wei Wei"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIE.2017.2786200","Project: hybrid AC/DC Microgrid"],"references":["310824518_Distributed_Coordination_Control_for_Multiple_Bidirectional_Power_Converters_in_a_Hybrid_ACDC_Microgrid","279199230_Droop_voltage_range_design_in_DC_micro-grids_considering_cable_resistance","279192587_Overview_of_Power_Management_Strategies_of_Hybrid_ACDC_Microgrid","310818860_A_Dual-Buck-Boost_ACDC_Converter_for_DC_Nanogrid_with_Three_Terminal_Outputs","310437145_A_Gallium_Nitride_Device_Based_Switched_Capacitor_Multiport_Multilevel_Converter_for_UPS_Applications","298426765_An_Enhanced_Droop_Control_Method_for_Accurate_Load_Sharing_and_Voltage_Improvement_of_Isolated_and_Interconnected_DC_Microgrids","290474513_A_Three-Phase_Bidirectional_ACDC_Converter_with_Y-D_Connected_Transformers","288263119_Autonomous_operation_of_hybrid_microgrid_with_ac_and_dc_sub-grids","282530758_An_Improved_Control_Method_for_Multiple_Bidirectional_Power_Converters_in_Hybrid_ACDC_Microgrid","276178236_A_Circulating_Current_Suppressing_Strategy_of_Parallel_Multiple_Converters_with_Individual_DC-links_for_Voltage_Source_Converters"]}
