{"id":"346206262_Survey_of_Automatic_Spelling_Correction","abstract":"Automatic spelling correction has been receiving sustained research attention. Although each article contains a brief introduction to the topic, there is a lack of work that would summarize the theoretical framework and provide an overview of the approaches developed so far. Our survey selected papers about spelling correction indexed in Scopus and Web of Science from 1991 to 2019. The first group uses a set of rules designed in advance. The second group uses an additional model of context. The third group of automatic spelling correction systems in the survey can adapt its model to the given problem. The summary tables show the application area, language, string metrics, and context model for each system. The survey describes selected approaches in a common theoretical framework based on Shannon’s noisy channel. A separate section describes evaluation methods and benchmarks.","authors":["Daniel Hladek","Ján Staš","Matus Pleva"],"meta":["October 2020Electronics 9(10):1670","DOI:10.3390/electronics9101670"],"references":["345425242_Spelling_Correction_of_Non-Word_Errors_in_Uyghur-Chinese_Machine_Translation","338511466_Spell_checking_algorithm_for_agglutinative_languages_Central_Kurdish_as_an_example","338070543_Denoising_Sequence-to-Sequence_Modeling_for_Removing_Spelling_Mistakes","337896067_Automated_Misspelling_Detection_and_Correction_in_Persian_Clinical_Text","336934144_Post_Text_Processing_of_Chinese_Speech_Recognition_Based_on_Bidirectional_LSTM_Networks_and_CRF","335830061_Investigation_of_Transformer_Based_Spelling_Correction_Model_for_CTC-Based_End-to-End_Mandarin_Speech_Recognition","333300899_Real-Word_Errors_in_Arabic_Texts_A_Better_Algorithm_for_Detection_and_Correction","340627143_An_LSTM-based_Spell_Checker_for_Indonesian_Text","340059544_Chinese_Spelling_Check_based_on_Sequence_Labeling","339095628_Neural_Spelling_Correction_for_Azerbaijani_Language"]}
