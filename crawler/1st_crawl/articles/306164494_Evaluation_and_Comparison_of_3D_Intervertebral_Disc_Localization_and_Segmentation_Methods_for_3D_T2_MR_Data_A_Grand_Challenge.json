{"id":"306164494_Evaluation_and_Comparison_of_3D_Intervertebral_Disc_Localization_and_Segmentation_Methods_for_3D_T2_MR_Data_A_Grand_Challenge","abstract":"The evaluation of changes in Intervertebral Discs (IVDs) with 3D Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging (MRI) can be of interest for many clinical applications. This paper presents the evaluation of both IVD localization and IVD segmentation methods submitted to the Automatic 3D MRI IVD Localiza tion and Segmentation challenge, held at the 2015 International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI2015) with an on-site competition. With the construction of a manually annotated reference data set composed of 25 3D T2-weighted MR images acquired from two di�erent studies and the establishment of a standard validation framework, quantitative evaluation was performed to compare the re-\nsults of methods submitted to the challenge. Experimental results show that overall the best localization method achieves a mean localization distance of 0.82mm and a successful detection rate of 98.55% for 2.0mm precision range and the best segmentation method achieves a mean Dice of 91.8%, a mean average absolute distance of 1.08mm and a mean Hausdor� distance of 4.34mm, respectively. The strengths and drawbacks of each method are discussed, which provides insights into the performance of di�erent IVD localization and segmentation methods.","authors":["Guoyan Zheng","Chengwen
