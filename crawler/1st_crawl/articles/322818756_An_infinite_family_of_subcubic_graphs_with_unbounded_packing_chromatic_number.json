{"id":"322818756_An_infinite_family_of_subcubic_graphs_with_unbounded_packing_chromatic_number","abstract":"Recently, Balogh, Kostochka and Liu in [Packing chromatic number of cubic graphs, Discrete Math.~341 (2018) 474--483] answered in negative the question that was posed in several earlier papers whether the packing chromatic number is bounded in the class of graphs with maximum degree $3$. In this note, we present an explicit infinite family of subcubic graphs with unbounded packing chromatic number.","authors":["Boštjan Brešar,","Jasmina Ferme"],"meta":["January 2018Discrete Mathematics 341(8)","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2018.05.004"],"references":["315695937_Packing_chromatic_number_of_subcubic_graphs","312142808_Packing_chromatic_number_mathbf_1_1_2_2_1_1_2_2_-colorings_and_characterizing_the_Petersen_graph","303812225_Packing_Coloring_of_Undirected_and_Oriented_Generalized_Theta_Graphs","284136096_Packing_Chromatic_Number_of_Base-3_Sierpinski_Graphs","261217822_S-Packing_Colorings_of_Cubic_Graphs","316200602_The_packing_chromatic_number_of_the_infinite_square_lattice_is_between_13_and_15","306357572_Packing_chromatic_number_under_local_changes_in_a_graph","283214499_The_packing_chromatic_number_of_hypercubes","277337496_Modeling_the_packing_coloring_problem_of_graphs","260032388_The_packing_coloring_problem_for_lobsters_and_partner_limited_graphs"]}
