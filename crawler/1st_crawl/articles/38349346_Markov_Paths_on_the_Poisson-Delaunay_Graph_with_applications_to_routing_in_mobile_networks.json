{"id":"38349346_Markov_Paths_on_the_Poisson-Delaunay_Graph_with_applications_to_routing_in_mobile_networks","abstract":"Consider the Delaunay graph and the Voronoi tessellation constructed with respect to a Poisson point process. The sequence of nuclei of the Voronoi cells that are crossed by a line defines a path on the Delaunay graph. We show that the evolution of this path is governed by a Markov chain. We study the ergodic properties of the chain and find its stationary distribution. As a corollary, we obtain the ratio of the mean path length to the Euclidean distance between the end points, and hence a bound for the mean asymptotic length of the shortest path.\nWe apply these results to define a family of simple incremental algorithms for constructing short paths on the Delaunay graph and discuss potential applications to routeing in mobile communication networks.","authors":["Fran√ßois Baccelli","Konstantin Tchoumatchenko","Sergei Zuyev"],"meta":["March 2000Advances in Applied Probability 32(1)","DOI:10.1239/aap/1013540019"],"references":["200111118_Markov_Chains_and_Stochastic_Stability","239994761_First-passage_percolation_on_the_Voronoi_tessellation_and_Delaunay_triangulation","238749946_Elements_of_Queueing_Theory","232128993_Stochastic_Geometry_and_Its_Application","227337046_Euclidean_models_of_first-passage_percolation","220983785_There_is_a_Planar_Graph_Almost_as_Good_as_the_Complete_Graph","220453452_Classes_of_Graphs_Which_Approximate_the_Complete_Euclidean_Graph","38362645_Subadditive_Ergodic_Theory"]}
