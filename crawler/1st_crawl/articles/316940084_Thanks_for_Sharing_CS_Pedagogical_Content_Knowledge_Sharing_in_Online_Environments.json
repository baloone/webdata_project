{"id":"316940084_Thanks_for_Sharing_CS_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_Sharing_in_Online_Environments","abstract":"Programs such as CS10K and CS for All in the United States seek to increase the number of CS teachers and provide training to them, highlighting the need to understand how best to support teachers at disadvantaged schools. Compared with teachers at larger or more affluent schools, they are less likely to gain CS pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through methods such as face to face conversations, attending conferences, or observing a colleague's class. However CS PCK is necessary for successful teaching and learning, and research has shown that teachers want opportunities to engage in reflective practice with peers. Thus teachers at underserved or isolated schools must rely on other methods to discuss and share CS PCK. We explore this problem by examining the current landscape of online resources used for this purpose. Data was collected from two online communication fora---one with lightly moderated content devoted to general CS education matters, and one with highly curated content devoted entirely to CS PCK. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of both fora, and synthesize our results by examining design recommendations for an online CS PCK resource that would capture the benefits of both environments.","authors":["Susannah Go","Brian Dorn"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2978249.2978253","Conference: Proceedings of the 11th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education"],"references":["301463409_Challenges_of_a_Computer_Science_Classroom_Initial_Perspectives_from_Teachers","270747438_Changing_Culture_Educating_the_Next_Computer_Scientists","262405861_Towards_a_conceptualization_of_pedagogical_content_knowledge_for_computer_science","252686088_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_and_Educational_Cases_in_Computer_Science_An_Exploration","228951140_Teaching_Programming_in_Secondary_School_A_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_Perspective","5948829_Finding_Scientific_Topics","321512261_Those_who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","320663850_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_and_Educational_Cases_in_Computer_Science_An_Exploration","310743832_Ten_Lessons_for_Computer_Science_for_All","301429177_Students'_cognition","266655058_PCK_and_reflection_in_computer_science_teacher_education","262693446_Measurement_of_pedagogical_content_knowledge_Students'_knowledge_and_conceptions","262257459_Competence_Measurement_and_Informatics_Standards_in_Secondary_Education","262176812_CS_principles_professional_development_only_9500_to_go","262157385_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","247957044_Developing_Science_Teachers'_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge","247928881_The_CS10K_project_mobilizing_the_community_to_transform_high_school_computing","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","241872512_Teaching_programming_in_secundary_school_a_pedagogical_content_knowledge_perspective","241622699_Computing_at_school_Stimulating_computing_education_in_the_UK","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation"]}
