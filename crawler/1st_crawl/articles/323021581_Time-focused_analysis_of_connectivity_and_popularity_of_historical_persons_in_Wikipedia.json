{"id":"323021581_Time-focused_analysis_of_connectivity_and_popularity_of_historical_persons_in_Wikipedia","abstract":"Wikipedia contains large amounts of content related to history. It is being used extensively for many knowledge intensive tasks within computer science, digital humanities and related fields. In this paper, we look into Wikipedia articles on historical people for studying link-related temporal features of articles on past people. Our study sheds new light on the characteristics of information about historical people recorded in the English Wikipedia and quantifies user interest in such data. We propose a novel style of analysis in which we use signals derived from the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia as well as from article view logs, and we overlay them over temporal dimension to understand relations between time periods, link structure and article popularity. In the latter part of the paper, we also demonstrate several ways for estimating person importance based on the temporal aspects of the link structure as well as a method for ranking cities using the computed importance scores of their related persons.","authors":["Adam Jatowt","Daisuke Kawai","Katsumi Tanaka"],"meta":["December 2019International Journal on Digital Libraries 20(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00799-018-0231-4"],"references":["345638150_Social_Amnesia_A_Critique_of_Contemporary_Psychology","318764177_Timestamping_Entities_using_Contextual_Information","310823974_Predicting_Importance_of_Historical_Persons_using_Wikipedia","305067457_Mapping_Temporal_Horizons_Analysis_of_Collective_Future_and_Past_related_Attention_in_Twitter","303901703_Digital_History_Meets_Wikipedia_Analyzing_Historical_Persons_in_Wikipedia","302285419_Can_Network_Analysis_Reveal_Importance_Degree_Centrality_and_Leaders_in_the_EU_Integration_Process","292496487_French_Cultural_Studies_Introduction","286939778_What_triggers_human_remembering_of_events_A_large-scale_analysis_of_catalysts_for_collective_memory_in_Wikipedia","280081029_Wikidata_A_Free_Collaborative_Knowledgebase","275366474_Temporal_information_searching_behaviour_and_strategies"]}
