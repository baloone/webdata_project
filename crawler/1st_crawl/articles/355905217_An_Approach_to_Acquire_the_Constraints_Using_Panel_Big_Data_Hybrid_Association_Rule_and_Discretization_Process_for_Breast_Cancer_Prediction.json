{"id":"355905217_An_Approach_to_Acquire_the_Constraints_Using_Panel_Big_Data_Hybrid_Association_Rule_and_Discretization_Process_for_Breast_Cancer_Prediction","abstract":"In recent years, big data has become an important branch of computer science. However, without AI, it is difficult to dive into the context of data as a prediction term, relying on a large feature of improving the process of prediction is connected with big data modelling, which appears to be a significant aspect of improving the process of prediction. Accordingly, one of the basic constructions of the big data model is the rule-based method. Rule-based method is used to discover and utilize a set of association rules that collectively represent the relationships identified by the system. This work focused on the use of the Apriori algorithm for the investigations of constraints from panel data using the discretization preprocess technique. The statistical outcomes are associated with the improved preprocess that can be applied over the transaction and it can illustrate interesting rules with confidence approximately equal to one. The minimum support provided to the present rule considers constraint as a milestone for the prediction model. The model makes an effective and accurate decision. In nowadays business, several guidelines have been produced. Moreover, the generation method was upgraded because of an association data algorithm that works for dissimilar principles of the structures compared with fewer breaks that are delivered by the discretization technique.","authors":["Ahmad Al Thunibat","Wael AL-zyadat","Mohammad Muhairat","Aysh Alhroob"],"meta":["November 2021Journal of Healthcare Engineering 2021(2011)","DOI:10.1155/2021/3870147"],"references":["339596528_Missing_Data_Prediction_using_Correlation_Genetic_Algorithm_and_SVM_Approach","338815969_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Map_Approach_for_Accruing_Velocity_of_Big_Data_Relies_on_Fireflies_Algorithm_for_Decentralized_Decision_Making","334635910_Hybrid_Approach_Using_Fuzzy_Logic_and_MapReduce_to_Achieve_Meaningful_Used_Big_Data","334536880_Development_Planning_in_the_Big_Data_Era_Design_References_Architecture","354062131_Data_Collection_and_Preparation","339890285_A_survey_of_evolutionary_computation_for_association_rule_mining","332654492_An_Improved_Apriori_Algorithm_Research_in_Massive_Data_Environment","330246692_Improving_Association_Rule_Mining_Using_Clustering-based_Discretization_of_Numerical_Data","327819862_Comparative_Analysis_of_Discretization_Algorithms_on_Decision_Tree","321835676_Big_Data_and_data_science_A_critical_review_of_issues_for_educational_research","321409106_On_the_Optimization_of_Improved_Apriori_Algorithm_via_Linked-list_Trie","319105205_A_Comparative_Study_with_RapidMiner_and_WEKA_Tools_over_some_Classification_Techniques_for_SMS_Spam","316681872_A_novel_image_steganographic_system_based_on_exact_matching_algorithm_and_key-dependent_data_technique","312398923_Machine_Learning_on_Big_Data_Opportunities_and_Challenges","310819762_Big_data_preprocessing_methods_and_prospects"]}
