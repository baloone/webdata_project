{"id":"309273491_Promoting_science_learning_in_game-based_learning_with_question_prompts_and_feedback","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the types of question prompts (Knowledge vs. Application Prompts) and feedback types (Knowledge of Correct Response (KCR) vs. Elaborated Response (ER) on science learning outcomes in a game-based learning environment. One hundred and five students from a secondary school in Taiwan were randomly assigned into four conditions: Knowledge-KCR, Knowledge-ER, Application-KCR, and Application-ER in a game-based learning environment to learn the concepts of force and motion. The results suggested that students with the knowledge prompts outperformed students with application prompts. In addition, we found that the types of question prompts and the types of feedback had an interaction effect on students' learning. Specifically, students with ER feedback performed better than those with KCR feedback when knowledge prompts were given; however, students with KCR feedback performed better than those with ER feedback when application prompts were given.","authors":["Victor Law","Ching-Huei Chen"],"meta":["October 2016Computers & Education
