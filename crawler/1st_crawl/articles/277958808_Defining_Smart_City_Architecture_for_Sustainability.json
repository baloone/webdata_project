{"id":"277958808_Defining_Smart_City_Architecture_for_Sustainability","abstract":"Smart city has been evolved since late 1990s to a rapidly emerged domain, where the academia, the industry and the government have mutual interest in transforming cities to innovation-based sustainable spaces. However, this evolution has come to a critical point of argument, where existing efforts are being developed\nmainly with public spending, which serve industrial purposes. As such, governments focus on smart city standardization in an attempt to clarify the smart city domain. Such standardization concerns smart city architecture too, which has to serve all potential innovations. This paper aims to define a common smart city architecture, which serves government purposes for innovation and sustainability, while it utilizes experiences from prestigious cases and corresponding theoretical context.","authors":["Leonidas G.
