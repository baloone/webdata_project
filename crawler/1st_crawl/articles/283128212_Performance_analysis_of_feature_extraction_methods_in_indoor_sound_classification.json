{"id":"283128212_Performance_analysis_of_feature_extraction_methods_in_indoor_sound_classification","abstract":"In this paper, by using a novel database of home environment warning sounds, the classification and recognition performances of these sounds are compared over feature extraction algorithms. Following the sample reduction of the feature vectors by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) algorithm is employed for classification. Besides, a modified version of the algorithm for MF coefficients is proposed and we observe that the classification performance is better than MFCC and LPC even at low SNR values.","authors":["Nurullah Calik","Lutfiye Durak Ata","Ahmet Serbes","BÃ¼lent Bolat"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/SIU.2015.7130263","Conference: 2015 23th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)"],"references":["308749743_A_Comparative_Study_Of_LPCC_And_MFCC_Features_For_The_Recognition_Of_Assamese_Phonemes","259003789_Classifying_Human_Voices_by_Using_Hybrid_SFX_Time-Series_Preprocessing_and_Ensemble_Feature_Selection","228976325_Sound_Detection_and_Classification_for_Medical_Telesurvey","228391290_Sound_Detection_through_Transient_Models_using_Wavelet_Coefficient_Trees","224089477_SVM-Based_Multi-Modal_Classification_of_Activities_of_Daily_Living_in_Health_Smart_Homes_Sensors_Algorithms_and_First_Experimental_Results","221757404_The_SWEET-HOME_project_Audio_technology_in_smart_homes_to_improve_well-being_and_reliance","29608395_Sound_and_Speech_Detection_and_Classification_in_a_Health_Smart_Home","7161855_Information_Extraction_From_Sound_for_Medical_Telemonitoring","246963974_Non-Speech_Environmental_Sound_Classification_System_for_Autonomous_Surveillance","23932917_Dual-Microphone_Sounds_of_Daily_Life_Classification_for_Telemonitoring_in_a_Noisy_Environment"]}
