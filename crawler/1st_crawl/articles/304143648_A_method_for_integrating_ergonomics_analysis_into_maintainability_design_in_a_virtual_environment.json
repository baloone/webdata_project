{"id":"304143648_A_method_for_integrating_ergonomics_analysis_into_maintainability_design_in_a_virtual_environment","abstract":"Designers must consider human factors/ergonomics when making decisions from the perspective of maintainability. As an important aspect of maintainability, maintenance space should be made adequate at the design stage to achieve a convenient maintenance process. A maintenance space evaluation method that considers ergonomics is proposed in this study. By comparing free swept volumes and constrained swept volumes in a virtual environment, maintenance space could be evaluated quantitatively and objectively. The results of the evaluation are obtained by combining the principles of ergonomics and maintainability. These results can help designers improve product design such that it fits ergonomics and maintainability requirements. A case study is introduced at the end of this paper to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method in efficiently evaluating the maintenance space based on the layout design of the product components in the design stage.\n\nFor a large number of disasters caused by human errors in current industry, the result of this study contributes a guide to fully consider human factors in maintainability design through virtual environment and is beneficial to designers and engineers of industrial application fields.","authors":["Dong Zhou","Jiayu Chen","Chuan Lv","Qingyuan Cao"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics 54:154-163","DOI:10.1016/j.ergon.2016.06.003"],"references":["303803052_Augmented_reality_an_application_of_heads-up_display_technology_to_manual_manufacturing_processes","228845602_EMM-3D_A_virtual_environment_for_evaluating_maintainability_from_CAD_models","228784909_Contact_Analysis_Between_a_Moving_Solid_and_the_Boundary_of_Its_Swept_Volume","221830779_A_Strategy_for_Human_FactorsErgonomics_Developing_the_Discipline_and_Profession","220721398_Surround-Screen_Projection-Based_Virtual_Reality_The_Design_and_Implementation_of_the_CAVE","51366133_Towards_understanding_the_workspace_of_human_limbs","7969163_Ergonomics_Applications_of_a_Mechanical_Model_of_the_Human_Operator_in_Power_Hand_Tool_Operation","4079748_Interactive_and_continuous_collision_detection_for_avatars_in_virtual_environments","3561826_Implicit_modeling_of_swept_surfaces_and_volumes","3510119_Augmented_reality_An_application_of_heads-up_display_technology_to_manual_manufacturing_processes","3501589_A_differential_equation_approach_to_swept_volumes","304146320_Contact_analysis_between_a_moving_solid_and_the_boundary_of_its_swept_volume","278394387_Axiomatic_design_principles_in_analysing_the_ergonomics_design_parameter_of_a_virtual_environment","263806125_SINGULARITY_THEORY_APPROACH_TO_SWEPT_VOLUMES","263798791_Maintenance_of_Geometric_Representations_Through_Space_Decompositions","263349687_Multiple_sweeping_using_the_Denavit-Hartenberg_representation_method","262950953_Computing_swept_volumes","245079442_Optimal_maintenance_policies_in_incomplete_repair_models","233559366_Offsets_sweeps_and_Minkowski_sums","232387850_Predicting_real-world_ergonomic_measurements_by_simulation_in_a_virtual_environment","225193506_Enhanced_Industrial_Maintenance_Work_Task_Planning_by_Using_Virtual_Engineering_Tools_and_Haptic_User_Interfaces","223909838_An_intelligent_system_for_the_detection_and_interpretation_of_sleep_apneas","223785213_A_haptic-based_approach_to_virtual_training_for_aerospace_industry","223605130_TIREDDX_An_integrated_intelligent_defects_diagnostic_system_for_tire_production_and_service","223091516_Design_and_implementation_of_a_fuzzy_expert_system_for_performance_assessment_of_an_integrated_health_safety_environment_HSE_and_ergonomics_system_The_case_of_a_gas_refinery","222842283_Using_Vector_Projection_Method_to_evaluate_maintainability_of_mechanical_system_in_design_review","222798382_The_sweep-envelope_differential_equation_algorithm_and_its_application_to_NC_machining_verification","222514039_Ergonomics_and_occupational_health_and_safety_in_the_oil_industry_A_managers'_response","222484933_On_the_determination_of_starting_points_for_parametric_surface_intersections","222313974_A_desktop_virtual_reality_prototype_system_for_maintenance_V-REALISM","220792084_Two-Handed_Direct_Manipulation_on_the_Responsive_Workbench","220669674_Three-Dimensional_Topological_Sweep_for_Computing_Rotational_Swept_Volumes_of_Polyhedral_Objects","220583287_Sweeping_of_three-dimensional_objects","220122637_Geometric_Representation_of_Swept_Volumes_with_Application_to_Polyhedral_Objects","2319573_On_Swept_Volume_Formulations_Implicit_Surfaces"]}
