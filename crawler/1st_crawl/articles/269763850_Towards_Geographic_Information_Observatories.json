{"id":"269763850_Towards_Geographic_Information_Observatories","abstract":"In this work we outline the vision of geographic information observatories, explain how and why GIScience would benefit from broadening its range to studies of the information universe (without necessarily relating it back to the physical universe), how our technology stack puts the GIScience community in a unique position to develop such observatories, and illustrate how these observatories would enable to ask new questions.","authors":["Krzysztof Janowicz","Benjamin Adams","Grant Donald McKenzie","Tomi Kauppinen"],"meta":["September 2014","Conference: Proceedings of the Workshop on Geographic Information Observatories 2014"],"references":["262405385_Core_concepts_of_spatial_information_for_transdisciplinary_research","260304852_The_Web_Science_Observatory","258510370_Physical-Cyber-Social_Computing_An_Early_21st_Century_Approach","241393594_D_Web_Science_An_Interdisciplinary_Approach_to_Understanding_the_Web","228609325_Spatialization_Methods_A_Cartographic_Research_Agenda_for_Non-geographic_Information_Visualization","220649698_Ontologies_of_geographic_information","220040509_Geographical_Information_Science"]}
