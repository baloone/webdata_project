{"id":"221547469_Minu_Viljandi_A_case_study_on_the_effects_of_introducing_Web_20_features_in_e-government_services_on_the_overall_user_experience_perception","abstract":"Since the 2000s the new forms of online communities and social networking are changing the logic of the Internet, which is creating pressure also on governments to follow the Web 2.0 trends. As users are no more satisfied only with the pragmatic attributes of a product as useful functions, but also expecting pleasure and satisfaction, this paper explores how governments can benefit from Web 2.0 features in order to provide enhanced service experience. The results show that some of the Web 2.0 features are perceived as highly appealing in online public service use referring to their ability to stimulate the innate human need for personal development or addressing a personal need of expressing oneself and being perceived by others in a certain way.","authors":["Geroli Peedu","David Lamas"],"meta":["September 2011","DOI:10.1145/2072069.2072124","SourceDBLP","Conference: ICEGOV 2011, Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance, Tallinn, Estonia, September 26-28, 2011"],"references":["226420570_The_Thing_and_I_Understanding_the_Relationship_Between_User_and_Product","221054457_When_Joy_Matters_The_Importance_of_Hedonic_Stimulation_in_Collocated_Collaboration_with_Large-Displays","202165765_The_transmedia_design_challenge_technology_that_is_pleasurable_and_satisfying","292692720_E-government_20","289088405_Innovation_in_Democratic_E-Governance_Benefitting_from_Web_20_Applications_in_the_Public_Sector","220526999_Innovation_in_Democratic_E-Governance"]}
