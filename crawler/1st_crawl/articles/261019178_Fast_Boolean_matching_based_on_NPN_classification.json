{"id":"261019178_Fast_Boolean_matching_based_on_NPN_classification","abstract":"This paper proposes a fast algorithm for Boolean matching of completely specified Boolean functions. The algorithm is based on the NPN classification and can be applied on-the-fly to millions of small practical functions appearing in industrial designs, leading to runtime and memory reduction in logic synthesis and technology mapping. The algorithm is conceptually simpler, faster, and more scalable than previous work.","authors":["Zheng Huang","Lingli Wang","Yakov Nasikovskiy","Alan Mishchenko"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1109/FPT.2013.6718374","Conference: Field-Programmable Technology (FPT), 2013 International Conference on"],"references":["254023768_Mapping_into_LUT_structures","4204188_Reducing_structural_bias_in_technology_mapping","3727746_The_disjunctive_decomposition_of_logic_functions","3224982_Efficient_canonical_form_for_Boolean_matching_of_complex_functions_in_large_libraries","290177464_A_new_canonical_form_for_fast_boolean_matching_in_logic_synthesis_and_verification","261124060_Lazy_Man's_Logic_Synthesis","238674030_The_decomposition_of_switching_functions","221627958_Efficient_Boolean_function_matching","221340320_Building_a_Better_Boolean_Matcher_and_Symmetry_Detector","4296822_Combinational_and_sequential_mapping_with_priority_cuts","4169503_A_new_canonical_form_for_fast_Boolean_matching_in_logic_synthesis_and_verification","4093078_Efficient_computation_of_canonical_form_for_Boolean_matching_in_large_libraries","2871736_A_Survey_of_Boolean_Matching_Techniques_for_Library_Binding"]}
