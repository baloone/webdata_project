{"id":"266506458_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval_using_Color_and_Texture","abstract":"The increased need of content based image retrieval technique can be found in a number of different\ndomains such as Data Mining, Education, Medical Imaging, Crime Prevention, Weather forecasting,\nRemote Sensing and Management of Earth Resources. This paper presents the content based image\nretrieval, using features like texture and color, called WBCHIR (Wavelet Based Color Histogram Image\nRetrieval).The texture and color features are extracted through wavelet transformation and color\nhistogram and the combination of these features is robust to scaling and translation of objects in an\nimage. The proposed system has demonstrated a promising and faster retrieval method on a WANG image\ndatabase containing 1000 general-purpose color images. The performance has been evaluated by\ncomparing with the existing systems in the literature.","authors":["Manimala Singha","K Hemachandran"],"meta":["February 2012Signal & Image Processing An International Journal 3(1)","DOI:10.5121/sipij.2012.3104"],"references":["267305404_CTDCIRS_Content_based_Image_Retrieval_System_based_on_Dominant_Color_and_Texture_Features","261484483_Image_Retrieval_with_Visually_Prominent_Features_using_Fuzzy_set_theoretic_Evaluation_ICVGIP_2004","313442881_Performance_analysis_of_color_spaces_in_image_retrieval","290487111_CBIR_using_color_histogram_processing","259703614_Visual_Information_Retrieval","248595029_Efficient_color_histogram_indexing_for_quadratic_form_distance","247642467_Statistical_and_Structural_12_Approaches_to_Texture","243658833_A_method_of_defining_the_similarity_of_images_on_the_basis_of_color_information","243526345_Database_architecture_for_content-based_image_retrieval","242491318_Automated_image_retrieval_using_color_and_texture"]}
