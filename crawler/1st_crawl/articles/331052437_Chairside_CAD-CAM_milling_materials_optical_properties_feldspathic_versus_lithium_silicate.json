Dental CAD-CAM technology have developed in the last three decades due to the evolution of dental materials and computer science. \nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the similarity of the color coordinates of different CAD-CAM milling materials with the corresponding tabs of the 3D Master shade guide.\nMaterials and method. Two different types of chairside CAD-CAM milling materials: feldspar ceramic (Vita Mark II - Vita) and zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic (Vita Suprinity - Vita) were used for this in vitro study. A group of 7 specimens of 1mm thicknesses were cut for each type of material with a precision cutting saw. CIEL*a*b* color coordinates of each sample were determined with a dental spectrophotometer (Vita Easyshade - Vita), as well as the color coordinates of a corresponding shade tab from a 3D Master shade guide and the color difference CIE 76 (Eab) and respectively CIE DE2000 (E00) were calculated.\nResults. Color differences (Eab and respectively E00) between the shade tab and the evaluated materials were 8,5 respectively 3,7 for Vita Mark II, 12,8 and respectively 6 for Vita Suprinity High Translucent and 33,3 respectively 12,7 for Vita Suprinity Translucent, way over the perceptibility and clinical acceptability thresholds\nConclusions. In the limitation of the study, a color difference above the limits of acceptability and perceptibility were found between each investigated material and the corresponding shade tab. \nKey words: ceramic, feldspathic, lithium silicate, color, CAD-CAM","authors":["Varvara Adrian Mihai","Ralph Boutros","Anca Mesaros","Elena Bianca VarvarÄƒ"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.26659/pm3.2018.19.4.230"],"references":["320854076_Key_Parameters_of_Hybrid_Materials_for_CADCAM-Based_Restorative_Dentistry","297641951_Effects_of_different_surface_finishing_procedures_on_the_change_in_surface_roughness_and_color_of_a_polymer_infiltrated_ceramic_network_material","275048525_Color_Difference_Thresholds_in_Dentistry","270290019_The_effect_of_repeated_firings_on_the_color_change_of_dental_ceramics_using_different_glazing_methods","322481471_Chairside_systems_a_current_review","317789677_Does_artificial_aging_affect_mechanical_properties_of_CADCAM_composite_materials","273112858_Understanding_dental_CADCAM_for_restorations_-_the_digital_workflow_from_a_mechanical_engineering_viewpoint","236337701_Fracture_strength_of_minimally_prepared_all-ceramic_CEREC_crowns_after_simulating_5_years_of_service","51464892_The_use_of_CADCAM_in_dentistry","51433425_Factors_Essential_for_Successful_All-Ceramic_Restorations","11987019_Clinical_Long-Term_Results_and_10Year_Kaplan-_Meier_Analysis_of_Cerec_Restorations","6913366_The_effect_of_polishing_techniques_on_the_surface_roughness_and_color_change_of_composite_resins","6875505_The_effects_of_porcelain_polishing_systems_on_the_color_and_surface_texture_of_feldspathic_porcelain","6838907_Clinical_performance_of_chairside_CADCAM_restorations","6378418_Optimization_of_Tooth_Color_and_Shade_Guide_Design"]}
