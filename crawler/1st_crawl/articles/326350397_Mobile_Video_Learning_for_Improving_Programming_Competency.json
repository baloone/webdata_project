{"id":"326350397_Mobile_Video_Learning_for_Improving_Programming_Competency","abstract":"Programming competency is a must competency that every student who are studying computer science must have. Mostly of the student are struggling learning this skill especially for those who do not have any computer background. The objective of this research is to design and develop e-learning using videos and tutorial to provide content of programming skill that needed by the student to increase their coding skill. Student can watch this video many times to have a fully understanding about the topic. Research and Development method are used by this research to design the video learning that can be accessed using mobile phone. As the result, the programming skill of the student increased rapidly.","authors":["Glenn Maramis","V R Palilingan","M Modeong"],"meta":["July 2018IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 384(1):012012","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/384/1/012012"],"references":["316845761_Comparative_Analysis_of_Two_Popular_Agile_Process_Models_Extreme_Programming_and_Scrum","276342954_Empirical_Study_of_Agile_Software_Development_Methodologies","266742377_Adopting_an_Agile_Approach_for_the_Development_of_Mobile_Applications","266483471_Learning_from_Online_Video_Lectures","260952270_Comparative_Analysis_of_Software_Engineering_Models_from_Traditional_to_Modern_Methodologies","237555200_CONFERENCE_STREAM_WORKPLACE_LEARNING_Transfer_between_Learning_and_Practice_The_Use_of_Web-based_Video_in_Higher_Education","220374785_Defining_Mobile_Learning_in_the_Higher_Education_Landscape","220308245_Is_scrum_and_XP_suitable_for_CSE_development","242591347_Extreme_programming_explained_embrace_change_addison-wesley","242350998_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change"]}
