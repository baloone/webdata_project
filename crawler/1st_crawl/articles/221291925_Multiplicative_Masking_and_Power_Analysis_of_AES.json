{"id":"221291925_Multiplicative_Masking_and_Power_Analysis_of_AES","abstract":"The recently proposed multiplicative masking countermeasure against power analysis attacks on AES is interesting as it does not require the costly recomputation and RAM storage of S-boxes for every run of AES. This is important for applications where the available space is very limited such as the smart card applications. Unfortunately, it is here shown that this method is in fact inherently vulnerable to differential power analysis. However, it is also shown that the multiplicative masking method can be modified so as to provide resistance to differential power analysis of nonideal but controllable security level, at the expense of increased computational complexity. Other possible random masking methods are also discussed.","authors":["Jovan Dj.
