{"id":"314922171_The_ReadWrite_Protocol_Complex_Is_Collapsible","abstract":"The celebrated asynchronous computability theorem provides a characterization of the class of decision tasks that can be solved in a wait-free manner by asynchronous processes that communicate by writing and taking atomic snapshots of a shared memory. Several variations of the model have been proposed (immediate snapshots and iterated immediate snapshots), all equivalent for wait-free solution of decision tasks, in spite of the fact that the protocol complexes that arise from the different models are structurally distinct. The topological and combinatorial properties of these snapshot protocol complexes have been studied in detail, providing explanations for why the asynchronous computability theorem holds in all the models.","authors":["Fernando Andr√©s Benavides Agredo","Sergio Rajsbaum"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-49529-2_14","Conference: Latin American Symposium on Theoretical Informatics"],"references":["234819920_Shavit_N_The_Topological_Structure_of_Asynchronous_Computability_Journal_of_the_ACM_466_858-923","227288056_The_BG_Distributed_Simulation_Algorithm","221540559_Recursion_in_Distributed_Computing","221343665_A_Simple_Algorithmically_Reasoned_Characterization_of_Wait-Free_Computations_Extended_Abstract","220431045_Impossibility_of_Distributed_Consensus_with_One_Faulty_Process","220430613_Atomic_Snapshots_of_Shared_Memory","213876653_The_Art_of_Multiprocessor_Programming","29643852_The_Iterated_Restricted_Immediate_Snapshot_Model","2809054_Computable_Obstructions_To_Wait-Free_Computability","2244210_A_Note_on_the_Homotopy_Type_of_Wait-Free_Atomic_Snapshot_Protocol_Complexes","290912781_Iterated_Chromatic_Subdivisions_are_Collapsible","286056649_Distributed_Computing_Through_Combinatorial_Topology","268164714_Simplicial_Complexes_of_Graphs","263056993_Topology_of_the_immediate_snapshot_complexes","259010202_Topology_of_the_view_complex","258232527_Chromatic_subdivision_of_a_simplicial_complex","254463127_Simulations_and_reductions_for_colorless_tasks","239583375_Memory_requirements_for_agreement_among_unreliable_asynchronous_processes","234816293_Immediate_atomic_snapshots_and_fast_renaming","221591110_Generalized_FLP_impossibility_result_for_t-resilient_asynchronous_computations","220618360_Wait-Free_k_-Set_Agreement_is_Impossible_The_Topology_of_Public_Knowledge","220617980_Toward_a_Topological_Characterization_of_Asynchronous_Complexity","220616769_The_Combinatorial_Structure_of_Wait-Free_Solvable_Tasks","220406761_A_Combinatorial_Characterization_of_the_Distributed_1-Solvable_Tasks"]}
