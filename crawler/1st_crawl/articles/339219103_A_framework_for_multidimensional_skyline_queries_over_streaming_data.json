{"id":"339219103_A_framework_for_multidimensional_skyline_queries_over_streaming_data","abstract":"Skyline query has attracted a great deal of interest during last years because of its ability to\nhelp decision makers when multi-criteria objectives are to be handled. Several authors have\npointed the interest of multidimensional skylines, i.e., the set of criteria become a parameter of\nthe query. In order to efficiently evaluate these queries, index structures have been proposed. In\nthis paper, we address the problem of efficiently handling multidimensional skyline queries in\nthe context of streaming data. The appended records have a validity time interval after which\nthey become outdated and hence, can be discarded. To that end, we propose a framework that\nhandles an index structure periodically updated. Then the queries consider just the indexed\ndata. This is the price we pay to deal with the streaming nature of the data we consider.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate our frameworkâ€™s ability to handle multi-\ndimensional skyline queries with challenging streaming data. The main criteria we consider\nto assess the performance of our solution are query execution time and both index structure\nmaintenance time and its memory consumption.","authors":["Karim Alami","Sofian Maabout"],"meta":["February 2020Data & Knowledge Engineering 127(3):101792","DOI:10.1016/j.datak.2020.101792","Project: SkyDex"],"references":["332597690_Multidimensional_Skylines_over_Streaming_Data","220312619_Efficient_continuous_skyline_computation","220225024_Progressive_Skyline_Computation_in_Database_Systems","4053418_Skyline_with_presorting","3297522_Maintaining_sliding_window_skylines_on_data_streams","336111442_The_negative_skycube","316849010_Template_Skycube_Algorithms_for_Heterogeneous_Parallelism_on_Multicore_and_GPU_Architectures","315807121_A_Survey_of_Skyline_Query_Processing","310821601_Skycube_Materialization_Using_the_Topmost_Skyline_or_Functional_Dependencies","309471797_Computing_and_Summarizing_the_Negative_Skycube","306093115_Skyline_Algorithms_on_Streams_of_Multidimensional_Data","305257866_Continuous_Queries_Over_Append-Only_Databases","288310205_Hashcube_A_Data_Structure_for_Space-_and_Query-Efficient_Skycube_Compression","265834088_Data_Stream_Management","259739231_Scalable_skyline_computation_using_a_balanced_pivot_selection_technique","257457915_Toward_efficient_multidimensional_subspace_skyline_computation","255719644_Issue_in_data_stream_management","239492550_Data_stream_management_issues_D_a_survey","238042095_Online_Subspace_Skyline_Query_Processing_Using_the_Compressed_Skycube","221310364_Efficient_Computation_of_the_Skyline_Cube","221310178_Catching_the_Best_Views_of_Skyline_A_Semantic_Approach_Based_on_Decisive_Subspaces","221103781_BSkyTree_scalable_skyline_computation_using_a_balanced_pivot_selection","220225553_Towards_multidimensional_subspace_skyline_analysis","200110483_A_Greedy_Heurisic_for_the_Set-Covering_Problem","4133492_Stabbing_the_sky_Efficient_skyline_computation_over_sliding_windows","2374777_The_Skyline_Operator"]}
