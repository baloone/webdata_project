{"id":"307949963_Ultra-portable_wireless_smartphone_spectrometer_for_rapid_non-destructive_testing_of_fruit_ripeness","abstract":"We demonstrate a smartphone based spectrometer design that is standalone and supported on a wireless platform. The device is inherently low-cost and the power consumption is minimal making it portable to carry out a range of studies in the field. All essential components of the device like the light source, spectrometer, filters, microcontroller and wireless circuits have been assembled in a housing of dimensions 88 mm × 37 mm × 22 mm and the entire device weighs 48 g. The resolution of the spectrometer is 15 nm, delivering accurate and repeatable measurements. The device has a dedicated app interface on the smartphone to communicate, receive, plot and analyze spectral data. The performance of the smartphone spectrometer is comparable to existing bench-top spectrometers in terms of stability and wavelength resolution. Validations of the device were carried out by demonstrating non-destructive ripeness testing in fruit samples. Ultra-Violet (UV) fluorescence from Chlorophyll present in the skin was measured across various apple varieties during the ripening process and correlated with destructive firmness tests. A satisfactory agreement was observed between ripeness and fluorescence signals. This demonstration is a step towards possible consumer, bio-sensing and diagnostic applications that can be carried out in a rapid manner.","authors":["Anshuman Das","Akshat Wahi","Ishan Kothari","Ramesh Raskar"],"meta":["September 2016Scientific Reports 6(1):32504","DOI:10.1038/srep32504"],"references":["285385900_G-Fresnel_Cellphone_Spectrometer","284031030_Unobtrusive_ambulatory_EEG_using_a_smartphone_and_flexible_printed_electrodes_around_the_ear","283206666_Sickle_cell_detection_using_a_smartphone","281869698_Mobile_phone_based_mini-spectrometer_for_rapid_screening_of_skin_cancer","281311773_Malaria_Diagnosis_Using_a_Mobile_Phone_Polarized_Microscope","280909599_Surface_Plasmon_Resonance_Biosensor_Based_on_Smart_Phone_Platforms","290545786_Chlorophyll_fluorescence_as_affected_by_some_superficial_defects_in_stored_apples","286713492_Ultraviolet_Fluorescence_to_Identify_Navel_Oranges_with_Poor_Peel_Quality_and_Decay","285534515_Heat_injury_thresholds_in_apples_measured_using_chlorophyll_fluorescence_are_influenced_by_orchard_heat_reduction_technologies","283885326_The_relationship_between_chlorophyll_fluorescence_and_fruit_quality_indices_in_'Jonagold'_and_'Gloster'_apples_during_ripening"]}
