{"id":"316630127_Stable_cubic_sets","abstract":"The notions of (almost) stable cubic set, stable element, evaluative set and stable degree are introduced, and related properties are investigated. Regarding internal (external) cubic sets and the complement of cubic set, their (almost) stableness and unstableness are discussed. Regarding the P-union, R-union, P-intersection and R-intersection of cubic sets, their (almost) stableness and unstableness are investigated.","authors":["G.
