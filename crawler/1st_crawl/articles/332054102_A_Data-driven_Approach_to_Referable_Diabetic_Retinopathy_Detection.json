{"id":"332054102_A_Data-driven_Approach_to_Referable_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection","abstract":"Prior art on automated screening of diabetic retinopathy and direct referral decision shows promising performance; yet most methods build upon complex hand-crafted features whose performance often fails to generalize.\n\nObjective: \nWe investigate data-driven approaches that extract powerful abstract representations directly from retinal images to provide a reliable referable diabetic retinopathy detector.\n\nMethods: \nWe gradually build the solution based on convolutional neural networks, adding data augmentation, multi-resolution training, robust feature-extraction augmentation, and a patient-basis analysis, testing the effectiveness of each improvement.\n\nResults: \nThe proposed method achieved an area under the ROC curve of 98.2% (95% CI: 97.4-98.9%) under a strict cross-dataset protocol designed to test the ability to generalize - training on the Kaggle competition dataset and testing using the Messidor-2 dataset. With a 5 Ã— 2-fold cross-validation protocol, similar results are achieved for Messidor-2 and DR2 datasets, reducing the classification error by over 44% when compared to most published studies in existing literature.\n\nConclusion: \nAdditional boost strategies can improve performance substantially, but it is important to evaluate whether the additional (computation- and implementation-) complexity of each improvement is worth its benefits. We also corroborate that novel families of data-driven methods are the state of the art for diabetic retinopathy screening.\n\nSignificance: \nBy learning powerful discriminative patterns directly from available training retinal images, it is possible to perform referral diagnostics without detecting individual lesions.","authors":["Ramon Pires","Sandra Avila","Jacques Wainer","Eduardo Valle"],"meta":["March 2019Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","DOI:10.1016/j.artmed.2019.03.009","Project: Automated Data-Driven Screening of Diabetic Retinopathy"],"references":["283548397_Beyond_Lesion-Based_Diabetic_Retinopathy_A_Direct_Approach_for_Referral","277716299_Automated_Multi-Lesion_Detection_for_Referable_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Indigenous_Health_Care","277411157_Deep_Learning","272989606_Feedback_on_a_publicly_distributed_image_database_The_Messidor_database","272518326_Automated_Retinal_Image_Analysis_for_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Telemedicine","262812069_Advancing_Bag-of-Visual-Words_Representations_for_Lesion_Classification_in_Retinal_Images","261381529_Data_fusion_for_multi-lesion_Diabetic_Retinopathy_detection","256074326_Assessing_the_Need_for_Referral_in_Automatic_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection","236048472_Automated_Analysis_of_Retinal_Images_for_Detection_of_Referable_Diabetic_Retinopathy","225186497_Points_of_Interest_and_Visual_Dictionaries_for_Automatic_Retinal_Lesion_Detection","23244839_Optimal_Wavelet_Transform_for_the_Detection_of_Microaneurysms_in_Retina_Photographs","315731224_Automated_Identification_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Using_Deep_Learning","311164170_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","309403354_Deep_Image_Mining_for_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Screening","308126941_Deep_learning_approach_for_diabetic_retinopathy_screening","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","305689941_Telemedicine_and_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Review_of_Published_Screening_Programs","292681590_Discrimination_of_retinal_images_containing_bright_lesions_using_sparse_coded_features_and_SVM","288918787_Automatic_detection_of_referral_patients_due_to_retinal_pathologies_through_data_mining","286271944_On_the_importance_of_initialization_and_momentum_in_deep_learning","280602670_Referral_system_for_hard_exudates_in_eye_fundus","271330182_The_Geographic_Distribution_of_Eye_Care_Providers_in_the_United_States_Implications_for_a_National_Strategy_to_Improve_Vision_Health","263546908_Evaluation_of_automated_image_analysis_software_for_the_detection_of_diabetic_retinopathy_to_reduce_the_ophthalmologists'_workload","235944122_TeleOphta_Machine_learning_and_image_processing_methods_for_teleophthalmology","232608909_Impact_of_Geographic_Density_of_Eye_Care_Professionals_on_Eye_Care_among_Adults_with_Diabetes","224604612_A_Survey_on_Transfer_Learning","49809077_Optimal_Filter_Framework_for_Automated_Instantaneous_Detection_of_Lesions_in_Retinal_Images","13540799_Approximate_Statistical_Tests_for_Comparing_Supervised_Classification_Learning_Algorithms","10411829_Proposed_international_clinical_diabetic_retinopathy_and_diabetic_macular_edema_disease_severity_scales"]}
