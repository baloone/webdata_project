{"id":"334672198_ImageTagger_An_Open_Source_Online_Platform_for_Collaborative_Image_Labeling","abstract":"The need for labeled training data for object recognition in RoboCup increased due to the spread of deep learning approaches. Creating large sets of training images from different environments and annotating the recorded objects is difficult for a single RoboCup team. This paper presents our tool ImageTagger which facilitates creating and sharing such data sets. The tool is already being successfully used in RoboCup Soccer, and a large amount of labeled data is publicly available. Other leagues are invited to use this tool to create data for their contexts.","authors":["Niklas Fiedler","Marc Bestmann","N.
