{"id":"303413115_Introduction_Time_and_Literature_After_the_Spatial_Turn","abstract":"This introductory chapter sets out the principal argument of the book: that literary narrative is uniquely situated to explore the conceptual relationship between place and time. Narrativeâ€™s formal dependence on the fourth dimension is no constraint to its power to spatialize and cartographically represent real and imaginary places. If we understand space not as a rational abstraction but as a concentration of dense and tangled rhythmic processes, narrative becomes an ideal means by which time and temporality can be given spatial form. Mediating between the vast and the microscopic, the fast and the slow, the fugitive rhythms of ephemeral experience and the repetitive rhythms of the planetary, narrative time can intervene powerfully in the ways in which we rhythmically relate to space and place.","authors":["Adam Barrows"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1057/978-1-137-56901-1_1","In book: Time, Literature, and Cartography After the Spatial Turn (pp.1-31)"],"references":[]}
