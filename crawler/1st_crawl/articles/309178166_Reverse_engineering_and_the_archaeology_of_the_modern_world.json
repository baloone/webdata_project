{"id":"309178166_Reverse_engineering_and_the_archaeology_of_the_modern_world","abstract":"This paper explores the practical and conceptual connections between the archaeology of post-industrial societies\nand the process of reverse engineering. It explores common themes such as industrial decline, the loss of technical\nexpertise, and the growing problem of obsolescence both in technological infrastructure and in the management\nof digital data. To illuminate the connections between the two fields it considers several examples. These\ninclude the implicit applications of reverse engineering in archaeology, such as chemical analyses of Egyptian\nmummification and alchemical equipment, as well as the use of archaeological concepts and terminologies in reverse\nengineering. The concept of archaeology as reverse engineering is examined with regard to military aircraft,\npost-industrial landscapes and so-called ‘non-places’. These illustrate the difficulty in inferring different forms of\nhuman activity and knowledge in past technologies, in particular so-called ‘tacit knowledge’. The final part of the\npaper discusses the potentials and limitations of building links between reverse engineering and the archaeology\nof the modern world, raising questions for further consideration.","authors":["Gabriel Moshenska"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.6105/journal.fka.2016.5.2"],"references":["285902485_After_Modernity_Archaeological_Approaches_to_the_Contemporary_Past_By_R_odney_H_arrison_and_J_ohn_S_chofield","270561842_Technical_does_not_mean_material"]}
