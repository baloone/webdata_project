The main materials was sodium hydroxide (NaOH), nickel acetate and cety trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), and extremely stirring until the pH becomes 7.5, and nanoparticles of (NiO) are prepared by chemical way of nickel hydroxide followed by heat treatment at 350 o C. Nickel oxide is the kind of most important class of materials due to its interesting and important thermal properties and has many applications, such as in catalysis, sensors and so on. Structural properties were checked by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) Structural and phases, transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surface morphology of the sample was executed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the particle size of NiO increased with the increase in temperature. Compared with other methods, this method is simple and the materials were inexpensive. Finally our results showed that the chemical synthesis method leads to obtain nickel oxide nanoparticles with good microscopic characterization.","authors":["Abdullah Hasan Jabbar","Maytham Qabel Hamzah","Salim Oudah Mezan","Nabeel Naeem Hasan"],"meta":["March 2018","Projects: ENERGY GAP INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF KESTERITE CU 2 ZNSNS 4 THIN FILM FOR SOLAR CELL APPLICATIONSstudy of nanomaterialsZwitter Characteristic"],"references":["322593221_STUDY_OF_NANO-SYSTEMS_FOR_COMPUTER_SIMULATIONS","276499314_Study_of_Optical_and_Electrical_Properties_of_Nickel_Oxide_NiO_Thin_Films_Deposited_by_Using_a_Spray_Pyrolysis_Technique","323386372_Semiconductor_Physics","322592727_Study-Magnetic-Properties-And-Synthesis-With-Characterization-Of-Nickel-Oxide","322095295_Synthesis_and_Characterization_of_Cu2ZnSnS4_CZTS_thin_film_by_Chemical_Bath_Deposition_CBD_for_Solar_Cell_Applications","305990213_Application_of_nanotechnology_by_means_of_nanoparticles_and_nanodispersions_in_oil_recovery_-_A_comprehensive_review","304039328_Effective_reduction_in_the_nanoparticle_sizes_of_NiO_obtained_via_the_pyrolysis_of_nickel_malonate_precursor_modified_using_oleylamine_surfactant","257580321_Electrochemical_performance_of_TiO2_and_NiO_as_fuel_cell_electrode_additives","228826363_Selective_growth_of_vertically_aligned_carbon_nanotubes_on_nickel_oxide_nanostructures_created_by_atomic_force_microscope_nano-oxidation","222216948_Details_of_crystalline_growth_in_co-deposited_electroplated_nickel_films_with_hard_nanoparticles"]}
