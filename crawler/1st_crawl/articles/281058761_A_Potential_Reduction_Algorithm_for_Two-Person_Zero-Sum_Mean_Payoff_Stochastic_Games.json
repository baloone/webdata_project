{"id":"281058761_A_Potential_Reduction_Algorithm_for_Two-Person_Zero-Sum_Mean_Payoff_Stochastic_Games","abstract":"We suggest a new algorithm for two-person zero-sum undiscounted stochastic\ngames focusing on stationary strategies. Given a positive real $\\epsilon$, let\nus call a stochastic game $\\epsilon$-ergodic, if its values from any two\ninitial positions differ by at most $\\epsilon$. The proposed new algorithm\noutputs for every $\\epsilon>0$ in finite time either a pair of stationary\nstrategies for the two players guaranteeing that the values from any initial\npositions are within an $\\epsilon$-range, or identifies two initial positions\n$u$ and $v$ and corresponding stationary strategies for the players proving\nthat the game values starting from $u$ and $v$ are at least $\\epsilon/24$\napart. In particular, the above result shows that if a stochastic game is\n$\\epsilon$-ergodic, then there are stationary strategies for the players\nproving $24\\epsilon$-ergodicity. This result strengthens and provides a\nconstructive version of an existential result by Vrieze (1980) claiming that if\na stochastic game is $0$-ergodic, then there are $\\epsilon$-optimal stationary\nstrategies for every $\\epsilon > 0$. The suggested algorithm is based on a\npotential transformation technique that changes the range of local values at\nall positions without changing the normal form of the game.","authors":["Endre Boros","Khaled Elbassioni","Vladimir Alexander Gurvich","Kazuhisa Makino"],"meta":["March 2018Dynamic Games and Applications 8(1)","DOI:10.1007/s13235-016-0199-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["331912424_A_Pseudo-Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Mean_Payoff_Stochastic_Games_with_Perfect_Information_and_Few_Random_Positions","324292868_Markovian_Decision_Processes","313559347_Stochastic_Games_with_Zero_Stop_Probabilities","312982657_Stochastic_games","286292797_A_Potential_Reduction_Algorithm_for_Ergodic_Two-Person_Zero-Sum_Limiting_Average_Payoff_Stochastic_Games","284528176_Finite_Markov_Chains","274653556_Stochastic_Games_with_Finite_State_and_Action_Spaces","266225126_Prolongement_des_jeux_a_deux_joueurs_de_somme_nulle_Une_theorie_abstraite_des_duels","264956147_Markovian_Decision_Processes","262986470_The_Complexity_of_Ergodic_Mean-payoff_Games"]}
