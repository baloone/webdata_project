{"id":"328398517_Intrinsic_limits_of_information_transmission_in_biochemical_signalling_motifs","abstract":"All living things have evolved to sense changes in their environment in order to respond in adaptive ways. At the cellular level, these sensing systems generally involve receptor molecules at the cell surface, which detect changes outside the cell and relay those changes to the appropriate response elements downstream. With the advent of experimental technologies that can track signalling at the single-cell level, it has become clear that many signalling systems exhibit significant levels of 'noise,' manifesting as differential responses of otherwise identical cells to the same environment. This noise has a large impact on the capacity of cell signalling networks to transmit information from the environment. Application of information theory to experimental data has found that all systems studied to date encode less than 2.5 bits of information, with the majority transmitting significantly less than 1 bit. Given the growing interest in applying information theory to biological data, it is crucial to understand whether the low values observed to date represent some sort of intrinsic limit on information flow given the inherently stochastic nature of biochemical signalling events. In this work, we used a series of computational models to explore how much information a variety of common 'signalling motifs' can encode. We found that the majority of these motifs, which serve as the basic building blocks of cell signalling networks, can encode far more information (4-6 bits) than has ever been observed experimentally. In addition to providing a consistent framework for estimating information-theoretic quantities from experimental data, our findings suggest that the low levels of information flow observed so far in living system are not necessarily due to intrinsic limitations. Further experimental work will be needed to understand whether certain cell signalling systems actually can approach the intrinsic limits described here, and to understand the sources and purpose of the variation that reduces information flow in living cells.","authors":["Ryan Suderman","Eric J.
