{"id":"351574132_Local_Fractional_Metric_Dimensions_of_Generalized_Petersen_Networks","abstract":"Metric dimension is a distance-based tool that is used in the different fields of computer science and chemistry such as navigation, combinatorial optimization, pattern recognition, image processing, integer programming and formation of chemical compounds. In this paper, we study the latest type of metric dimension called as local fractional metric dimension (LFMD) and find its upper bounds for generalized Petersen networks GP(n, 2), where n ≥ 5. Moreover, for n ∈ {5, 8, 10} exact values and for n ∈ {6, 7, 9, 11} constant upper bounds of the LFMD are obtained. For n ≥ 12, the limiting values of LFMD for GP(n, 2) are also obtained as 2 (bounded) if n approaches to infinity.","authors":["Mohsin Raza","Dalal Awadh Alrowaili","Muhammad Javaid"],"meta":["May 2021IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3080130"],"references":["350028331_Computing_Bounds_of_Fractional_Metric_Dimension_of_Metal_Organic_Graphs","346894724_Sharp_Bounds_of_Local_Fractional_Metric_Dimensions_of_Connected_Networks","332301859_On_the_local_fractional_metric_dimension_of_corona_product_graphs","330490436_Fractional_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Jahangir_Graph","323517407_On_fractional_metric_dimension_of_comb_product_graphs","272175075_On_Fractional_Metric_Dimension_of_Graphs","265889329_The_metric_dimension_and_metric_independence_of_a_graph","341093777_Local_Fractional_Metric_Dimensions_of_Rotationally_Symmetric_and_Planar_Networks","272372827_The_fractional_metric_dimension_of_permutation_graphs","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph"]}
