{"id":"226600651_Properties_and_Performance_of_Shape_Similarity_Measures","abstract":"This paper gives an overview of shape dissimilarity measure properties, such as metric and robustness properties, and of retrieval\nperformance measures. Fifteen shape similarity measures are shortly described and compared. Their retrieval results on the\nMPEG-7 Core Experiment CE-Shape-1 test set as reported in the literature and obtained by a reimplementation are compared and\ndiscussed.","authors":["Remco C.
