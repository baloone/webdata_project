{"id":"328520653_Improving_the_Secret_Key_Rate_of_Coherent_Quantum_Key_Distribution_With_Bayesian_Inference","abstract":"Laser phase noise is one of the major limitations in continuous-variable quantum key distribution, when the local oscillator is placed at the receiver site. Thus, improving phase noise mitigation can improve the secret key rate. This paper provides an experimental investigation of different Bayesian methods for that purpose. It is shown that, compared to a previously reported method, the excess noise power can be reduced by about 15%. In some scenarios, this can improve the secret key rate by a factor of 9.","authors":["Sebastian Kleis","Christian Schaeffer"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Lightwave Technology PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JLT.2018.2877823"],"references":["315682295_Continuous-Variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution_with_Gaussian_Modulation_--_The_Theory_of_Practical_Implementations","290507835_Long-distance_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution_by_controlling_excess_noise","281076678_Stochastic_Simultaneous_Optimistic_Optimization","281056131_High-speed_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution_without_sending_a_local_oscillator","276426102_Laser_Rate_Equation_Based_Filtering_for_Carrier_Recovery_in_Characterization_and_Communication","273067167_Generating_the_Local_Oscillator_Locally_in_Continuous-Variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Based_on_Coherent_Detection","242694022_Quantum_key_distribution_over_25km_with_an_all-fiber_continuous-variable_system","236346106_Preventing_Calibration_Attacks_on_the_Local_Oscillator_in_Continuous-Variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution","228072780_Analysis_of_Imperfections_in_Practical_Continuous-Variable_Quantum_KeyDistribution","216301003_Convergence_Properties_of_the_Nelder--Mead_Simplex_Method_in_Low_Dimensions","45925071_Continuous-variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution_protocols_with_eight-state_discrete_modulation","45915461_Finite-size_analysis_of_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution","10948540_Grosshans_F_Assche_G_V_Wenger_J_Cerf_R_B_J_Grangier_P_Quantum_key_distribution_using_gaussian-modulated_coherent_states_Nature_421_238-241","324934115_High-Rate_Continuous-Variables_Quantum_Key_Distribution_with_Piloted-Disciplined_Local_Oscillator","323562032_Improving_the_Performance_of_Coherent_Quantum_Communications_with_Bayesian_Inference","322706277_High_key_rate_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution_with_a_real_local_oscillator","316018955_Continuous_variable_quantum_key_distribution_with_a_real_local_oscillator_using_simultaneous_pilot_signals","259390620_Bayesian_Filtering_and_Smoothing","232608392_Experimental_demonstration_of_long-distance_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution","26284976_Unconditional_Security_Proof_of_Long-Distance_Continuous-Variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution_with_Discrete_Modulation","2984910_Discrete_Simulation_of_Colored_Noise_and_Stochastic_Processes_and_1f_Power_Law_Noise_Generation"]}
