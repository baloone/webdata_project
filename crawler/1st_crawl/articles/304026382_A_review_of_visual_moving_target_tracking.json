{"id":"304026382_A_review_of_visual_moving_target_tracking","abstract":"Recently, computer vision and multimedia understanding become important research domains in computer science. Meanwhile, visual tracking of moving target, one of most important application in computer vision, becomes a highlight today. So, this paper reviews research and technology in this domain. First, background and application of visual tracking is introduced. Then, visual tracking methods are classified by different thinking and technologies. Their positiveness, negativeness and improvement are analyzed deeply. Finally, difficulty in this domain is summarized and future prospect of related fields is presented.","authors":["Zheng Pan","Shuai Liu","Weina Fu"],"meta":["August 2017Multimedia Tools and Applications 76(16)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-016-3647-0"],"references":["319769907_Learning_Multi-Domain_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Visual_Tracking","304409403_Learning_Spatially_Regularized_Correlation_Filters_for_Visual_Tracking","322276795_Surf_Speeded_up_robust_features","313596785_Locally_orderless_tracking","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points","313522833_PCA-SIFT_A_more_distinctive_representation_for_local_image_descriptors","313469241_Real_time_robust_L1_tracker_using_accelerated_proximal_gradient_approach","311610678_Learning_Multi-domain_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Visual_Tracking","308642582_ASIFT_A_new_framework_for_fully_affine_invariant_image_comparison","306129255_The_visual_object_tracking_VOT2015_challenge_results","304408604_Understanding_and_Diagnosing_Visual_Tracking_Systems","303482906_Mean-shift_blob_tracking_through_scale_space_In_Computer_Vision_and_Pattern_Recognition_2003","303206053_Locally_orderless_tracking","301952074_Haar-Like_and_HOG_Fusion_Based_Object_Tracking","301252996_Non-rigid_Object_Tracking_Using_Modified_Mean-Shift_Method"]}
