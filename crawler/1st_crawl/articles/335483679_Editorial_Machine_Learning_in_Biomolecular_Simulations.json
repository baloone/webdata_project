{"id":"335483679_Editorial_Machine_Learning_in_Biomolecular_Simulations","abstract":"\"Interest in machine learning is growing in all fields of science, industry, and business. This interest was not primarily initiated by new theoretical findings. Interestingly, the theoretical basis of the majority of machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, or kernel methods, have been known for a relatively long time. Instead, there are other effects that triggered the recent boom of machine learning.\"","authors":["Gennady Verkhivker","Vojtech Spiwok","Francesco Luigi Gervasio"],"meta":["August 2019Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences 6:76","DOI:10.3389/fmolb.2019.00076","Project: Machine learning and computational drug discovery"],"references":[]}
