{"id":"342994710_Industry_40_Readiness_Models_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Model_Dimensions","abstract":"It is critical for organizations to self-assess their Industry 4.0 readiness to survive and thrive in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Thereon, conceptualization or development of an Industry 4.0 readiness model with the fundamental model dimensions is needed. This paper used a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and content analysis strategy to review 97 papers in peer-reviewed academic journals and industry reports published from 2000 to 2019. The review identifies 30 Industry 4.0 readiness models with 158 unique model dimensions. Based on this review, there are two theoretical contributions. First, this paper proposes six dimensions (Technology, People, Strategy, Leadership, Process and Innovation) that can be considered as the most important dimensions for organizations. Second, this review reveals that 70 (44%) out of total 158 total unique dimensions on Industry 4.0 pertain to the assessment of technology alone. This establishes that organizations need to largely improve on their technology readiness, to strengthen their Industry 4.0 readiness. In summary, these six most common dimensions, and in particular, the dominance of the technology dimension provides a research agenda for future research on Industry 4.0 readiness.","authors":["Mohd Hizam BIN Hanafiah","Mansoor Ahmed Soomro","Nor Liza Abdullah"],"meta":["July 2020Information (Switzerland) 11(7):364","DOI:10.3390/info11070364","Project: Industry 4.0 Readiness"],"references":["331436271_A_Metamodel_for_Evaluating_Enterprise_Readiness_in_the_Context_of_Industry_40","330872573_Assessing_Industry_40_readiness_a_multi-country_industry_level_analysis","330703907_Key_ingredients_for_evaluating_Industry_40_readiness_for_organizations_a_literature_review","329557969_Uzbekistan_towards_Industry_40_Defining_the_gaps_between_current_manufacturing_systems_and_Industry_40","328956674_A_conceptual_approach_to_analysing_manufacturing_companies'_profiles_concerning_Industry_40_in_emerging_economies","328883977_Rapidly_arriving_futures_Future_readiness_for_industry_40","328726147_A_Critical_Review_of_Smart_Manufacturing_Industry_40_Maturity_Models_Implications_for_Small_and_Medium-sized_Enterprises_SMEs","332088479_Maturity_Models_in_the_Age_of_Industry_40_-_Do_the_Available_Models_Correspond_to_the_Needs_of_Business_Practice","331097271_Shaping_the_Future_of_the_Fourth_Industrial_Revolution","329021440_A_review_of_Internet_of_Things_IoT_embedded_Sustainable_Supply_Chain_for_Industry_40_requirements"]}
