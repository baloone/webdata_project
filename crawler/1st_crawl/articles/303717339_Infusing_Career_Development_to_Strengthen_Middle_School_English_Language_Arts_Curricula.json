{"id":"303717339_Infusing_Career_Development_to_Strengthen_Middle_School_English_Language_Arts_Curricula","abstract":"An approach is presented for strengthening middle school standards-based English language arts (ELA) classroom instruction by infusing theory- and research-supported career development constructs and practices. Over an 8-week period, 90 urban 7th graders participated in an integrated ELA–career development curriculum. Career agency emerged as an important construct for students. It was related to key markers of ELA achievement (i.e., standardized test scores, grades, and positive change in 6th- to 7th-grade test scores) and elaborated on in nuanced ways by students in their written narratives. Four themes related to career agency were identified in student writings: time perspective, challenges of self-direction, career development, and social and emotional development. Advantages for students and schools related to synergy, scale, and sustainability are discussed. © 2016 by the National Career Development Association. All rights reserved.","authors":["Richard T.
