{"id":"306254446_Digital_Innovation_Management_Reinventing_Innovation_Management_Research_in_a_Digital_World","abstract":"Rapid and pervasive digitization of innovation processes and outcomes has upended extant theories on innovation management by calling into question fundamental assumptions about the definitional boundaries for innovation, agency for innovation, and the relationship between innovation processes and outcomes. There is a critical need for novel theorizing on digital innovation management that does not rely on such assumptions and draws on the rich and rapidly emerging research on digital technologies. We offer suggestions for such theorizing in the form of four new theorizing logics, or elements, that are likely to be valuable in constructing more accurate explanations of innovation processes and outcomes in an increasingly digital world. These logics can open new avenues for researchers to contribute to this important area. Our suggestions in this paper, coupled with the six research notes included in the special issue on digital innovation management, seek to offer a broader foundation for reinventing innovation management research in a digital world.","authors":["Satish Nambisan","kalle lyytinen","Ann Majchrzak","michael song"],"meta":["January 2017MIS Quarterly 41(1)","DOI:10.25300/MISQ/2017/41:1.03"],"references":["314645003_Grassroots_Digital_Fabrication_and_Makerspaces_Reconfiguring_Relocating_and_Recalibrating_Innovation","314439560_Platform_Ecosystems_How_Developers_Invert_the_Firm","314040620_Knowledge_Reuse_for_Customization_Metamodels_in_an_Open_Design_Community_for_3D_Printing","320619437_Growing_on_steroids_rapidly_scaling_the_user_base_of_digital_ventures_through_digital_innovation","320537977_Narrative_and_Innovation_New_Ideas_for_Business_Administration_Strategic_Management_and_Entrepreneurship","318999402_Platform_Ecosystems_How_Developers_Invert_the_Firm","318494161_The_Future_of_the_Internet--And_How_to_Stop_It","315334243_Emergent_Lifecycle_The_Tension_between_Knowledge_Change_and_Knowledge_Retention_in_Open_Online_Co-Production_Communities","315334080_Managing_Crowds_in_Innovation_Challenges","314889398_Thinking_About_Technology_Applying_a_Cognitive_Lens_to_Technical_Change","313075408_Organizational_learning_and_communities-of-practice_Toward_a_unified_view_of_working_learning_and_innovation","312600483_Embracing_Digital_Innovation_in_Incumbent_Firms_How_Volvo_Cars_Managed_Competing_Concerns","312532408_Digital_business_strategy_Toward_a_next_generation_of_insights","309104690_Growing_on_Steroids_Rapidly_Scaling_the_User_Base_of_Digital_Ventures_Through_Digital_Innovation","307864644_External_Knowledge_and_Information_Technology_Implications_for_Process_Innovation_Performance"]}
