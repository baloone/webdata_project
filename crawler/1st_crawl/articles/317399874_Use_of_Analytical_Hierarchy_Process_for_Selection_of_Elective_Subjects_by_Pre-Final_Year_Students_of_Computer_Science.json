{"id":"317399874_Use_of_Analytical_Hierarchy_Process_for_Selection_of_Elective_Subjects_by_Pre-Final_Year_Students_of_Computer_Science","abstract":"An eternally updating and enhancing nature of Information Technology and Communication leads to frequent revise of the curriculum\nsyllabus in computer science courses, specifically in framing elective subjects for the courses of master degree. Choosing of preeminent elective\nsubject by students depends on numerous parameters or criteria. This paper highlights the results of analysis of criteria which students\nconsidered for deciding on selection of elective subjects. The study assessed 12 subjects which are divided into two main heads - elective I and\nelective II. For this Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was applied to evaluate the preference of students towards elective subjects.\nA list of five criteria was prepared to select the best elective subjects. These criteria are student interest, subject content, future application, factor\nof ease and peer‟s choice. The outcome of the proposed research experiment shows that student gave more significance to „Future Application‟\nin selecting any of the elective subjects. Considering future application, „Data Mining‟ and „Android Programming – I‟ are the subjects which\ngained maximum preferences considering the stated criteria.","authors":["Jatinderkumar R.
