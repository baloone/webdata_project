{"id":"316545286_Design_and_Deployment_of_Hands-on_Network_Lab_Experiments_for_Computer_Science_Engineers","abstract":"Computer networks is an essential area in the training of computer science engineers. Delivery of networking laboratory experiments with specialized equipment is a challenge for computer networks teachers. The high cost of networking equipment makes it necessary to use simulation software to overcome the challenges of a large groups of students and working with complex topologies. This paper presents the first version of practical teaching materials to be used in networking courses for the Computer Science Engineering degree at the University of Salamanca (Computer Networks I and II). This material will allow students to work with real equipment in some cases and with simulation environments in others, maximizing the benefits of both.","authors":["Angeles M.
