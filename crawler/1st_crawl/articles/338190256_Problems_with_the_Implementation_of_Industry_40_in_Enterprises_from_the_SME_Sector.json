{"id":"338190256_Problems_with_the_Implementation_of_Industry_40_in_Enterprises_from_the_SME_Sector","abstract":"Industry is currently undergoing a revolution (called Revolution 4.0) related to the far-reaching integration of all production areas through the digitization and the creation of new communication channels. The Polish economy generated a GDP of USD 524.5 billion in 2017, of which small and medium enterprises generated about 50% of revenue and in which microenterprises accounted for the largest share in generating GDP; i.e., around 30.2%. The aim of the research is to determine the adaptation possibilities of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) sector to Industry 4.0 solutions. Pilot research was carried out in the Czestochowa Industrial District. Enterprises from the SME sector were asked to provide an information about the used technologies and to determine the level of their organizationâ€™s readiness for sustainable development through technological transformation. Financial resources as well as a lack of specialized support in obtaining new technologies were defined as problems as far as transformation is concerned. The solution of the diagnosed problem is the development of a platform aimed at integrating the potential of enterprises from the SME sector in order to undertake joint actions for sustainable development.","authors":["Manuela Ingaldi","Robert Ulewicz"],"meta":["December 2019Sustainability 12(1):217","DOI:10.3390/su12010217"],"references":["335626281_How_to_Make_E-Commerce_More_Successful_by_Use_of_Kano's_Model_to_Assess_Customer_Satisfaction_in_Terms_of_Sustainable_Development","329882815_Visual_and_optometric_issues_with_smart_glasses_in_Industry_40_working_environment","328611557_Industry_40_and_lean_management_a_proposed_integration_model_and_research_propositions","328468173_Industry_40_in_Management_Studies_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","328348779_Industry_40_and_Sustainability_Implications_A_Scenario-Based_Analysis_of_the_Impacts_and_Challenges","328231983_Sustainable_Industrial_Value_Creation_in_SMEs_A_Comparison_between_Industry_40_and_Made_in_China_2025","327754176_Considering_Industry_40_aspects_in_the_supply_chain_for_an_SME","328197120_PRESENCIA_DE_LA_INDUSTRIA_40_EN_LA_FABRICACION_ADITIVA_ANALISIS_DE_TENDENCIAS_TECNOLOGICAS","328098539_Industry_40_national_and_regional_comparative_advantages_in_key_enabling_technologies","327894020_Fashion_40_Innovating_fashion_industry_through_digital_transformation","326943099_Consequences_of_Industry_40_in_Business_and_Economics","326715026_Problems_in_the_Implementation_of_the_Lean_Concept_at_a_Steel_Works_-_Case_Study","326487801_BARRIERS_AND_OPPORTUNITIES_IN_THE_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_LEAN_MANUFACTURING_IN_THE_CERAMIC_INDUSTRY","326113219_INDUSTRY_40-ARE_WE_READY","325857465_Industry_40_Challenges_for_Business_Process_Management_and_Electronic-Commerce"]}
