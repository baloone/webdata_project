{"id":"283654950_Development_of_individualized_pattern_prototype_based_on_classification_of_body_features","abstract":"Purpose\n– The purpose of this paper is to concentrate on the development of individualized prototype of apparel patterns for young females from 3D body scanning data.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– The authors presented a new pattern-making approach that is composed of three major steps: to establish the relationships between body features and corresponding elements in a prototype (e.g. curve or a point); to classify the relationship into grades that provide alternatives to fit a variety of bodies; and to assemble each individual element into a personalized prototype.\n\nFindings\n– The experiment demonstrated that this method could be used for customized prototype development from 3D body scanning in a relatively easy way.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n– Currently, the subjects of this study included only Chinese young females, and the regression models were just suitable for the similar body types though, the research method could be extended to other somatotypes and age groups.\n\nSocial implications\n– This approach can be used in the field of made-to-measure, mass customization, and the quick response for apparel pattern making. The technology in this paper facilitates to generate an individualized pattern prototype from 3D body scanning data.\n\nOriginality/value\n– Originated from the relationship between the features of a human body and the elements of a pattern prototype, the authors presented a new approach to develop an individualized pattern prototype by classifying the features into grades.","authors":["Junqiang Su","Guolian Liu","Bugao Xu"],"meta":["November 2015International Journal of Clothing Science and Technology 27(6):895-907","DOI:10.1108/IJCST-11-2014-0136"],"references":["274167953_Female_Apparel_Consumers'_Understanding_of_Body_Size_and_Shape_Relationship_Among_Body_Measurements_Fit_Satisfaction_and_Body_Cathexis","271881880_Calculation_rules_research_of_female_lower_body_torso_3D_sizes","258196230_Categorization_of_lower_body_shapes_for_adult_females_based_on_multiple_view_analysis","235272804_Body_measurement_techniques_Comparing_3D_body-scanning_and_anthropometric_methods_for_apparel_applications","228625999_3D_Laser_Scanning_A_Model_of_Multidisciplinary_Research","286867111_Vacant_ease_distribution_relationship_between_body_and_garment","286836150_Development_of_a_prototype_pattern_based_on_the_3D_surface_flattening_method_for_MTM_garment_production","271545080_3D_measurement_of_the_human_body_for_apparel_mass_customization","269366089_Style_Design_of_Men's_Pants_and_Programming_Realization","263555243_Intelligent_design_systems_for_apparel_mass_customization","258196443_Customer_participating_3D_garment_design_for_mass_personalization","258196219_Determination_of_3D_necklines_from_scanned_human_bodies","258195889_A_constructive_approach_toward_a_parametric_pattern-making_model","256688001_Computer_aided_clothing_pattern_design_with_3D_editing_and_pattern_alteration","253641049_Using_3D_Scans_for_Fit_Analysis","251735640_Size_-specific_Analysis_of_Body_Scan_Data_to_Improve_Apparel_Fit","251735636_Body_Scanning_and_Modeling_for_Custom_Fit_Garments","249360414_Investigating_the_development_of_digital_patterns_for_customized_apparel","247782694_Three-Dimensional_Body_Scan_Data_AnalysisBody_Size_and_Shape_Dependence_of_Ease_Values_for_Pants'_Fit","244079505_Mass_customization_Points_and_extent_of_apparel_customization","242336663_Systematic_representation_and_application_of_a_3D_computer-aided_garment_construction_method_Part_I_3D_garment_basic_cut_construction_on_a_virtual_body_model","241156822_Researching_on_parameter-producing_automatically_on_the_basis_of_E-MTM_apparel_model","236232201_Three-dimensional_Technology_for_Apparel_Mass_Customization_Part_I_Body_Scanning_with_Rotary_Laser_Stripes","235299146_Enabling_mass_customization_Computer-driven_alteration_methods","233139831_Three-dimensional_Technology_for_Apparel_Mass_Customization_Part_II_Human_Body_Modeling_from_Unorganized_Range_Data","223493390_The_development_of_an_intelligent_system_for_customized_clothing_making","223478332_3D_virtual_apparel_design_for_industrial_applications","221097905_A_Method_for_Garment_Pattern_Generation_by_Flattening_3D_Body_Scan_Data","220583650_Reactive_2D3D_garment_pattern_design_modification","220119102_Optimisation_of_garment_design_using_fuzzy_logic_and_sensory_evaluation_techniques","51046555_Breast_Volumetry_Using_a_Three-Dimensional_Surface_Assessment_Technique","47870608_A_study_of_ease_distribution_in_relation_to_jacket_pattern_alteration","47618065_Computerized_pattern_making_focus_on_fitting_to_3D_human_body_shapes","3208555_Computer_Graphics_Techniques_for_Modeling_Cloth"]}
