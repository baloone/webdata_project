{"id":"290215461_Computerized_Sewer_Pipe_Condition_Assessment","abstract":"Traditionally, CCTV inspection has been widely used for sewer pipeline inspection when the pipe size is not large enough for the human entry. Although CCTV inspection delivers robust inspection capability, assessment results are highly dependent on the operator's ability, experience, and concentration. The limitations of the CCTV camera and light conditions often cause incorrect defect identification. While many municipalities invest millions of dollars for computerized asset management systems, the lack of reliability of source data (i.e., inaccurate or incorrect inspection result) makes the million-dollar investment useless. A digital scanner like the Sewer Scanner and Evaluation Technology (SSET) has been gradually accepted as a superior alternative to CCTV for accurate condition assessment. The improved image quality provides improved inspection accuracy and reliability. However, digital scanners are still not completely independent from human errors. This paper presents a brief overview of SSETTM and automatic condition assessment by use of SSET.","authors":["Myung Jin (Andy) Chae","Tom Iseley","Dulcy M.
