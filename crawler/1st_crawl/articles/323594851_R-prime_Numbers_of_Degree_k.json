{"id":"323594851_R-prime_Numbers_of_Degree_k","abstract":"In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input. Here, \"easy\" and \"hard\" are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems. Not being one-to-one is not considered sufficient of a function for it to be called one-way (see Theoretical Definition, in article). A twin prime is a prime number that has a prime gap of two, in other words, differs from another prime number by two, for example the twin prime pair (5,3). The question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in number theory for many years. This is the content of the twin prime conjecture, which states: There are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also prime. In this work we define a new notion: ‘r-prime number of degree k’ and we give a new RSA trap-door one-way. This notion generalized a twin prime numbers because the twin prime numbers are 2-prime numbers of degree 1.","authors":["Abdelhakim Chillali"],"meta":["February 2018Boletim da Sociedade Paranaense de Matematica 38(2):75","DOI:10.5269/bspm.v38i2.38218","Project: Elliptic Curve Cryptography"],"references":["233779414_Cryptography_Over_Elliptic_Curve_Of_The_Ring","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220426289_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","2538368_Twenty_Years_of_Attacks_on_the_RSA_Cryptosystem"]}
