{"id":"337586093_Business_process_specification_verification_and_deployment_in_a_mono-cloud_multi-edge_context","abstract":"Despite the prevalence of cloud and edge computing, ensuring the satisfaction of time-constrained business processes, remains challenging. Indeed, some cloud/edge-based resources might not be available when needed leading to delaying the execution of these processes? tasks and/or the transfer of these processes? data. This paper presents an approach for specifying, verifying, and deploying time constrained business processes in a mono-cloud, multi-edge context. First, the specification and verification of processes happen at design-time and run-time to ensure that these processes? tasks and data are continuously placed in a way that would mitigate the violation of time constraints. This mitigation might require moving tasks and/or data from one host to another to reduce time latency, for example. A host could be either a cloud, an edge, or any. Finally, the deployment of processes using a real case-study allowed to confirm the benefits of the early specification and verification of these processes in mitigating time constraints violations.","authors":["Saoussen Cheikhrouhou","Slim Kallel","Ikbel Guidara","Zakaria Maamar"],"meta":["January 2019Computer Science and Information Systems 17(00):41-41","DOI:10.2298/CSIS190430041C"],"references":["46430121_Time_slack-based_techniques_for_robust_project_scheduling_subject_to_resource_uncertainty","334326594_Restriction-based_fragmentation_of_business_processes_over_the_cloud","327000520_Formal_Verification_of_Temporal_Constraints_and_Allocated_Cloud_Resources_in_Business_Processes"]}
