{"id":"341286699_Trials_Skills_and_Future_Standpoints_of_AI_Based_Research_in_Bioinformatics","abstract":"In recent times, computer field has entered in all types of business and industries. Recent advancements in the information technology field, has open up many possibilities in multidisciplinary research. Machine learning, deep learning, convolution neural network, etc. are recent development in computer fields which has change the way of development of algorithms. Such algorithms can learn over a period of time while in execution and improves its performance and continue learning. Bioinformatics is the recent example of the science which strives to use such recent technologies of computer science for betterment in its own field. This article reviews Artificial Intelligence subset such as Machine learning and Deep learning in the genomics and proteomics domain. This article provides profound insights of various AI techniques which can be incorporated in the field of bioinformatics. The paper also highlighted the future research potential of this field. Computational biology, genomics, proteomics, Drug designing, gene expression level analysis are the major research areas in bioinformatics. These areas are also discussed in the paper.","authors":["Mubina Malik","Jaimin Undaiva"],"meta":["May 2020International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering","DOI:10.35940/ijrte.A1920.059120"],"references":["335987626_Machine_learning_for_discovering_missing_or_wrong_protein_function_annotations_A_comparison_using_updated_benchmark_datasets","335437526_Feature_selection_methods_and_genomic_big_data_a_systematic_review","318959509_Feature_selection_techniques_in_bioinformatics","301335377_DanQ_A_hybrid_convolutional_and_recurrent_deep_neural_network_for_quantifying_the_function_of_DNA_sequences","283644387_Continuous_Distributed_Representation_of_Biological_Sequences_for_Deep_Proteomics_and_Genomics","276069270_Machine_learning_applications_in_genetics_and_genomics","265605606_Machine_learning_for_Big_Data_analytics_in_plants","8251098_A_primer_on_gene_expression_and_microarrays_for_machine_learning_researchers"]}
