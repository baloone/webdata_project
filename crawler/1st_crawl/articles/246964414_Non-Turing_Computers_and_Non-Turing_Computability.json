{"id":"246964414_Non-Turing_Computers_and_Non-Turing_Computability","abstract":"A true Turing machine (TM) requires an infinitely long paper tape. Thus a TM can be housed in the infinite world of Newtonian spacetime (the spacetime of common sense), but not necessarily in our world, because our world-at least according to our best spacetime theory, general relativity-may be finite. All the same, one can argue for the \"existence\" of a TM on the basis that there is no such housing problem in some other relativistic worlds that are similar (\"close\") to our world. But curiously enough-and this is the main point of this paper-some of these close worlds have a special spacetime structure that allows TMs to perform certain Turing unsolvable tasks. For example, in one kind of spacetime a TM can be used to solve first-order predicate logic and the halting problem. And in a more complicated spacetime, TMs can be used to decide arithmetic. These new computers serve to show that Church's thesis is a thoroughly contingent claim. Moreover, since these new computers share the fundamental properties of a TM in ordinary operation (e.g. intuitive, finitely programmed, limited in computational capability), a computability theory based on these non-Turing computers is no less worthy of investigation than orthodox computability theory. Some ideas about this new mathematical theory are given.","authors":["Mark Hogarth"],"meta":["January 1994PSA Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association 1994(1)","DOI:10.2307/193018"],"references":["285520249_The_physical_Church_thesis_and_physical_computational_complexity","239578559_Turing_AM_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungs_problem_Proc_Lond_Math_Soc_Ser_2_42_230-265","234806269_Computability_and_logic","234357305_The_Large_Scale_Structure_of_Space-Time","233067410_Logic_Logic_and_Logic"]}
