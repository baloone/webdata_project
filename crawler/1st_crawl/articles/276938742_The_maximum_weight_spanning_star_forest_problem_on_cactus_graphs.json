{"id":"276938742_The_maximum_weight_spanning_star_forest_problem_on_cactus_graphs","abstract":"A star is a graph in which some node is incident with every edge of the graph, i.e., a graph of diameter at most 2. A star forest is a graph in which each connected component is a star. Given a connected graph G in which the edges may be weighted positively. A spanning star forest of G is a subgraph of G which is a star forest spanning the nodes of G. The size of a spanning star forest F of G is defined to be the number of edges of F if G is unweighted and the total weight of all edges of F if G is weighted. We are interested in the problem of finding a Maximum Weight spanning Star Forest (MWSFP) in G. In [C. T. Nguyen, J. Shen, M. Hou, L. Sheng, W. Miller and L. Zhang, Approximating the spanning star forest problem and its applications to genomic sequence alignment, SIAM J. Comput. 38(3) (2008) 946â€“962], the authors introduced the MWSFP and proved its NP-hardness. They also gave a polynomial time algorithm for the MWSF problem when G is a tree. In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm that solves the MSWF problem when G is a cactus.","authors":["Viet Hung Nguyen"],"meta":["March 2015Discrete Mathematics Algorithms and Applications 07(02):1550018","DOI:10.1142/S1793830915500184"],"references":["220976595_An_Improved_Approximation_Bound_for_Spanning_Star_Forest_and_Color_Saving","220617188_Approximating_the_Spanning_Star_Forest_Problem_and_Its_Application_to_Genomic_Sequence_Alignment","220789096_On_Variants_of_the_Spanning_Star_Forest_Problem"]}
