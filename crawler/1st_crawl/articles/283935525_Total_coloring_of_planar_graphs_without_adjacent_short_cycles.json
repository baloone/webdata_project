{"id":"283935525_Total_coloring_of_planar_graphs_without_adjacent_short_cycles","abstract":"In the study of computer science, optimization, computation of Hessians matrix, graph coloring is an important tool. In this paper, we consider a classical coloring, total coloring. Let (Formula presented.) be a graph. Total coloring is a coloring of (Formula presented.) such that no two adjacent or incident elements (vertex/edge) receive the same color. Let G be a planar graph with (Formula presented.). We proved that if for every vertex (Formula presented.), there exists two integers (Formula presented.) such that v is not incident with adjacent (Formula presented.)-cycles and (Formula presented.)-cycles, then the total chromatic number of graph G is (Formula presented.).","authors":["Huijuan Wang","Bin Liu","Yan Gu","Xin Zhang"],"meta":["January 2017Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 33(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-015-9954-y"],"references":["277561955_-Total_-colorings_of_graphs","271512783_Graph_Theory_and_Applications","268280589_Minimum_total_coloring_of_planar_graph","265354457_Total_Colourings_of_Graphs","262881422_Minimum_number_of_disjoint_linear_forests_covering_a_planar_graph","259513747_Total_coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_maximum_degree_8","257586256_The_r-acyclic_chromatic_number_of_planar_graphs","255613936_Total_Coloring_of_Planar_Graphs_without_Adjacent_4-cycles","242948081_The_Entire_Coloring_of_Series-Parallel_Graphs","242911063_On_total_9-coloring_planar_graphs_of_maximum_degree_seven"]}
