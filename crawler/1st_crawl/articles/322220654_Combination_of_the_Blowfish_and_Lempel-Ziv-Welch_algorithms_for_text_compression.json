{"id":"322220654_Combination_of_the_Blowfish_and_Lempel-Ziv-Welch_algorithms_for_text_compression","abstract":"Delivery of secure information in small sizes becomes a necessity in communication within networks, and to accommodate this, a cryptographic process is needed. In this research, the Blowfish algorithm was used for data security and the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm was used for data compression. In the test carried out, the authors found that the compression result of ciphertext result of compression was smaller and also safer, because the indirect ciphertext changed when the compression process was done. So, the combination of these two algorithms give a positive result.","authors":["Robbi Rahim","M. Dahria","M. Syahril","B.
