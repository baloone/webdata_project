{"id":"258729157_Thrust_Productivity-Oriented_Library_for_CUDA","abstract":"Thrust is a parallel algorithms library which resembles the C++ Standard\nTemplate Library (STL). Thrust's high-level interface greatly enhances\nprogrammer productivity while enabling performance portability between\nGPUs and multicore CPUs. Interoperability with established technologies\n(such as CUDA, TBB, and OpenMP) facilitates integration with existing\nsoftware.","authors":["Nathan Bell","Jared Hoberock"],"meta":["December 2012"],"references":[]}
