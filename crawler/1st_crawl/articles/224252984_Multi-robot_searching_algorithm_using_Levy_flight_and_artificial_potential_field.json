{"id":"224252984_Multi-robot_searching_algorithm_using_Levy_flight_and_artificial_potential_field","abstract":"An efficient search algorithm is very crucial in robotic area, especially for exploration missions, where the target availability is unknown and the condition of the environment is highly unpredictable. In a very large environment, it is not sufficient to scan an area or volume by a single robot, multiple robots should be involved to perform the collective exploration. In this paper, we propose to combine bio-inspired search algorithm called LÃ©vy flight and artificial potential field method to perform an efficient searching algorithm for multi-robot applications. The main focus of this work is to prove the concept and to measure the efficiency of the algorithm. Several experiments, which compare different search algorithms, are also performed.","authors":["Donny Sutantyo","Serge Kernbach","P.
