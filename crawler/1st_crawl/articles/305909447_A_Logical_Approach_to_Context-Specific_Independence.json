{"id":"305909447_A_Logical_Approach_to_Context-Specific_Independence","abstract":"Bayesian networks constitute a qualitative representation for conditional independence (CI) properties of a probability distribution. It is known that every CI statement implied by the topology of a Bayesian network G is witnessed over G under a graph-theoretic criterion called d-separation. Alternatively, all such implied CI statements have been shown to be derivable using the so-called semi-graphoid axioms. In this article we consider Labeled Directed Acyclic Graphs (LDAG) the purpose of which is to graphically model situations exhibiting context-specific independence (CSI). We define an analogue of dependence logic suitable to express context-specific independence and study its basic properties. We also consider the problem of finding inference rules for deriving non-local CSI and CI statements that logically follow from the structure of a LDAG but are not explicitly encoded by it.","authors":["Jukka Corander","Antti Hyttinen","Juha Kontinen","Johan Pensar"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-52921-8_11","Conference: International Workshop on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation"],"references":["279632670_Reasoning_About_Embedded_Dependencies_Using_Inclusion_Dependencies","257367548_Labeled_Directed_Acyclic_Graphs_a_generalization_of_context-specific_independence_in_directed_graphical_models","256762560_A_Finite_Axiomatization_of_Conditional_Independence_and_Inclusion_Dependencies","230738681_Dependence_and_Independence","2489568_Context-Specific_Independence_in_Bayesian_Networks","305911408_Approximation_and_Dependence_via_Multiteam_Semantics","304621142_Context-Specific_and_Local_Independence_in_Markovian_Dependence_Structures","286547186_Reasoning_about_saturated_conditional_independence_under_uncertainty_Axioms_algorithms_and_Levesque's_situations_to_the_rescue","282621459_Frontiers_for_propositional_reasoning_about_fragments_of_probabilistic_conditional_independence_and_hierarchical_database_decompositions","267067395_Dependence_logic_A_new_approach_to_independence_friendly_logic","264968009_Conditional_independence_relations_have_no_finite_complete_characterization","263968956_On_the_completeness_of_the_semigraphoid_axioms_for_deriving_arbitrary_from_saturated_conditional_independence_statements","259162935_Sound_approximate_reasoning_about_saturated_conditional_probabilistic_independence_under_controlled_uncertainty","242575516_Conditional_Independence_in_Statistical_Theory","236203247_Axiomatizing_First-Order_Consequences_in_Independence_Logic","236136565_On_the_Logic_of_Causal_Models","230609787_Axiomatizing_First_Order_Consequences_in_Dependence_Logic","227614072_Identifying_Independence_in_Bayesian_Networks","220690050_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models_Principles_and_Techniques","220486158_On_the_Conditional_Independence_Implication_Problem_A_Lattice-Theoretic_Approach","220247244_On_the_Undecidability_of_Implications_Between_Embedded_Multivalued_Database_Dependencies","220247154_Axioms_and_Algorithms_for_Inferences_Involving_Probabilistic_Independence","216301244_Probabilistic_Reasoning_in_Intelligent_Systems_Networks_Of_Plausible_Inference","51910370_Inclusion_and_Exclusion_Dependencies_in_Team_Semantics_On_Some_Logicsof_Imperfect_Information","3412006_On_the_Implication_Problem_for_Probabilistic_Conditional_Independency"]}
