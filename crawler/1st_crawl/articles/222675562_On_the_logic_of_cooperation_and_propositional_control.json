{"id":"222675562_On_the_logic_of_cooperation_and_propositional_control","abstract":"Cooperation logics have recently begun to attract attention within the multi-agent systems community. Using a cooperation logic, it is possible to represent and reason about the strategic powers of agents and coalitions of agents in game-like multi-agent systems. These powers are generally assumed to be implicitly defined within the structure of the environment, and their origin is rarely discussed. In this paper, we study a cooperation logic in which agents are each assumed to control a set of propositional variablesâ€”the powers of agents and coalitions then derive from the allocation of propositions to agents. The basic modal constructs in this Coalition Logic of Propositional Control (cl-pc) allow us to express the fact that a group of agents can cooperate to bring about a certain state of affairs. After motivating and introducing cl-pc, we provide a complete axiom system for the logic, investigate the issue of characterising control in cl-pc with respect to the underlying power structures of the logic, and formally investigate the relationship between cl-pc and Pauly's Coalition Logic. We then show that the model checking and satisfiability problems for cl-pc are both pspace-complete, and conclude by discussing our results and how cl-pc sits in relation to other logics of cooperation.","authors":["Wiebe van der Hoek","Michael Wooldridge"],"meta":["May 2005Artificial Intelligence 164(1-2):81-119","DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2005.01.003","SourceDBLP"],"references":["225174169_Branching_vs_Linear_Time_Final_Showdown","221551291_A_First_Order_Theory_of_Planning_Knowledge_and_Action","221455909_Agents_and_Roles_Refinement_in_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","221403574_MOCHA_Modularity_in_Model_Checking","221393607_Solving_QBF_by_SMV","220689159_Model_Checking","46614650_Boolean_Games","2611876_Model_Checking_vs_Theorem_Proving_A_Manifesto","2525814_Tractable_Multiagent_Planning_for_Epistemic_Goals","309697967_Agents_and_roles_Refinement_in_alternating-time_temporal_logic","303969276_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","266524057_Modal_Logic","246698441_Linear_time_Final_showdown","245996930_E_ectivity_Functions_in_Social_Choice_Theory","243787344_Reasoning_about_Knowledge_and_Action_IJCAI77","243648792_Backwards_and_Forwards_in_the_Modal_Logic_of_Agency","243648610_A_New_Introduction_to_Modal_Logic","242640524_Modal_Logic_An_Introduction","239577899_A_formal_theory_of_knowledge_and_action","230625814_Temporal_and_Modal_Logic","229685980_Seeing_To_it_That_A_Canonical_Form_for_Agentives","228057894_Computational_Complexity","226334991_On_the_Logic_of_Ability","226075422_Bringing_it_about","225181737_Time_Knowledge_and_Cooperation_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Epistemic_Logic_and_Its_Applications","222705784_Model_checking_cooperation_knowledge_and_time_-_A_case_study","222333696_Deciding_branching_time_logic","222219393_STRIPS_A_new_approach_to_the_application_of_theorem_proving_to_problem_solving","220958393_Timed_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","220816058_Knowledge_Preconditions_for_Actions_and_Plans","220388434_The_Cooperative_Problem-Solving_Process","220327281_Reasoning_About_Rational_Agents","220297849_Getting_started_Beginnings_in_the_Logic_of_Action","37705063_Logics_of_Time_and_Computation","36130825_Reasoning_About_Knowledge_and_Action","35488276_Logic_for_social_software","34644226_Reasoning_about_knowledge_and_action","30983999_A_Modal_Logic_for_Coalitional_Power_in_Games","23573647_A_course_in_Game_Theory","4738440_A_Logical_Framework_for_Coalitional_Effectivity_in_Dynamic_Procedures","4021749_Satisfiability_in_alternating-time_temporal_logic","3728288_Alternating-time_temporal_logic","3677431_Reactive_modules","2908359_On_The_Semantics_Of_Strips","2819612_MOCHA_modularity_in_model_checking","2600107_Formalizing_the_Cooperative_Problem_Solving_Process","2597264_Intelligent_Agents_Theory_and_Practice","2540396_The_Complexity_of_Temporal_Logic_Model_Checking","2486024_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2415953_Logic_for_Mechanism_Design_-_A_Manifesto"]}
