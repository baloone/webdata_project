{"id":"333840258_Instance_and_Output_Optimal_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Acyclic_Joins","abstract":"Massively parallel join algorithms have received much attention in recent years, while most prior work has focused on worst-optimal algorithms. However, the worst-case optimality of these join algorithms relies on hard instances having very large output sizes, which rarely appear in practice. A stronger notion of optimality is \\em output-optimal, which requires an algorithm to be optimal within the class of all instances sharing the same input and output size. An even stronger optimality is \\em instance-optimal, i.e., the algorithm is optimal on every single instance, but this may not always be achievable. In the traditional RAM model of computation, the classical Yannakakis algorithm is instance-optimal on any acyclic join. But in the massively parallel computation (MPC) model, the situation becomes much more complicated. We first show that for the class of r-hierarchical joins, instance-optimality can still be achieved in the MPC model. Then, we give a new MPC algorithm for an arbitrary acyclic join with load $O (\\IN øver p + \\sqrt\\IN \\cdot ØUT øver p )$, where $\\IN,ØUT$ are the input and output sizes of the join, and p is the number of servers in the MPC model. This improves the MPC version of the Yannakakis algorithm by an $O (\\sqrtØUT øver \\IN )$ factor. Furthermore, we show that this is output-optimal when $ØUT = O(p \\cdot \\IN)$, for every acyclic but non-r-hierarchical join. Finally, we give the first output-sensitive lower bound for the triangle join in the MPC model, showing that it is inherently more difficult than acyclic joins.","authors":["Xiao Hu","Ke Yi"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1145/3294052.3319698","Conference: the 38th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium"],"references":["266972058_GYM_A_Multiround_Join_Algorithm_In_MapReduce","262404404_Hypertree_Decompositions_Structure_Algorithms_and_Applications","262348273_Worst-case_Optimal_Join_Algorithms","259624951_Skew_in_Parallel_Query_Processing","241689300_Communication_Steps_for_Parallel_Query_Processing","221559923_Parallel_evaluation_of_conjunctive_queries","221559651_Provenance_Semirings","200034389_On_the_Desirability_of_Acyclic_Database_Schemes","200034379_Algorithms_for_Acyclic_Database_Schemes","325371672_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Parallel_Query_Processing","323762124_Worst-case_Optimal_Join_Algorithms","323338484_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Parallel_Data_Processing","321069605_Constraint_Solving_via_Fractional_Edge_Covers","321025240_Size_bounds_and_query_plans_for_relational_joins","316849403_Output-optimal_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Similarity_Joins","316848770_A_Worst-Case_Optimal_Multi-Round_Algorithm_for_Parallel_Computation_of_Conjunctive_Queries","316848631_Answering_Conjunctive_Queries_under_Updates","316848059_What_Do_Shannon-type_Inequalities_Submodular_Width_and_Disjunctive_Datalog_Have_to_Do_with_One_Another","313879283_Answering_Conjunctive_Queries_under_Updates","311514560_What_do_Shannon-type_inequalities_submodular_width_and_disjunctive_datalog_have_to_do_with_one_another","304021439_Towards_a_Worst-Case_IO-Optimal_Algorithm_for_Acyclic_Joins","304021295_AJAR_Aggregations_and_Joins_over_Annotated_Relations","303983439_Triejoin_A_simple_worst-case_optimal_join_algorithm","301875756_Worst-Case_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Parallel_Query_Processing","298921469_Dichotomies_for_Queries_with_Negation_in_Probabilistic_Databases","280773009_It's_All_a_Matter_of_Degree_Using_Degree_Information_to_Optimize_Multiway_Joins","267673949_Listing_Triangles","266657585_Beyond_worst-case_analysis_for_joins_with_Minesweeper","260707483_Optimizing_Multiway_Joins_in_a_Map-Reduce_Environment","259105926_The_InputOutput_Complexity_of_Triangle_Enumeration","221591836_Towards_polynomial_lower_bounds_for_dynamic_problems","221558331_On_Acyclic_Conjunctive_Queries_and_Constant_Delay_Enumeration","220473871_Efficient_query_evaluation_on_probabilistic_databases","220419823_A_Bridging_Model_for_Parallel_Computation","45882402_Tractable_Hypergraph_Properties_for_Constraint_Satisfaction_and_Conjunctive_Queries","30511935_Algorithmes_et_complexite_des_problemes_d'enumeration_pour_l'evaluation_de_requetes_logiques","2950263_Ecient_Query_Evaluation_on_Probabilistic_Databases"]}
