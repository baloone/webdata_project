{"id":"353856159_Control_of_the_activity_of_CAR-T_cells_within_tumours_via_focused_ultrasound","abstract":"Focused ultrasound can deliver energy safely and non-invasively into tissues at depths of centimetres. Here we show that the genetics and cellular functions of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) within tumours can be reversibly controlled by the heat generated by short pulses of focused ultrasound via a CAR cassette under the control of a promoter for the heat-shock protein. In mice with subcutaneous tumours, locally injected T cells with the inducible CAR and activated via focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging mitigated on-target off-tumour activity and enhanced the suppression of tumour growth, compared with the performance of non-inducible CAR-T cells. Acoustogenetic control of the activation of engineered T cells may facilitate the design of safer cell therapies. The activity of engineered T cells within tumours can be controlled via the heat generated by pulses of focused ultrasound by modifying the cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor under the control of a promoter for the heat-shock protein.","authors":["Yiqian Wu","Yahan Liu","Ziliang Huang","Xin Wang"],"meta":["November 2021Nature Biomedical Engineering 5(11):1-12","DOI:10.1038/s41551-021-00779-w"],"references":["340953988_Locoregionally_administered_B7-H3-targeted_CAR_T_cells_for_treatment_of_atypical_teratoidrhabdoid_tumors","340953871_Locoregional_delivery_of_CAR_T_cells_to_the_cerebrospinal_fluid_for_treatment_of_metastatic_medulloblastoma_and_ependymoma","335737051_Gold_nanoshell-localized_photothermal_ablation_of_prostate_tumors_in_a_clinical_pilot_device_study","334620200_Immune-orthogonal_orthologues_of_AAV_capsids_and_of_Cas9_circumvent_the_immune_response_to_the_administration_of_gene_therapy","333310974_Monitoring_of_the_central_blood_pressure_waveform_via_a_conformal_ultrasonic_device","330875564_CAR_T_Cells_for_Solid_Tumors_New_Strategies_for_Finding_Infiltrating_and_Surviving_in_the_Tumor_Microenvironment","327801147_Monitoring_of_the_central_blood_pressure_waveform_via_a_conformal_ultrasonic_device","324888350_Universal_Chimeric_Antigen_Receptors_for_Multiplexed_and_Logical_Control_of_T_Cell_Responses","324023746_Remote_Control_of_Mammalian_Cells_with_Heat-Triggered_Gene_Switches_and_Photothermal_Pulse_Trains","323568087_Image-guided_Control_of_Transgene_Expression_Based_on_Local_Hyperthermia","323204166_CAR-T_cells_the_long_and_winding_road_to_solid_tumors","322560504_Mechanogenetics_for_the_remote_and_noninvasive_control_of_cancer_immunotherapy","320339921_Optimization_of_IL13Ra2-Targeted_Chimeric_Antigen_Receptor_T_cells_for_Improved_Persistence_and_Antitumor_Efficacy_Against_Glioblastoma","318560606_Regional_Delivery_of_Chimeric_Antigen_Receptor_CAR_T-Cells_for_Cancer_Therapy","320586871_Regional_Delivery_of_Chimeric_Antigen_Receptor-Engineered_T_Cells_Effectively_Targets_HER2_Breast_Cancer_Metastasis_to_the_Brain"]}
