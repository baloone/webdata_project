{"id":"296626464_Discovering_communities_in_complex_networks_by_edge_label_propagation","abstract":"The discovery of the community structure of real-world networks is still an open problem. Many methods have been proposed to shed light on this problem, and most of these have focused on discovering node community. However, link community is also a powerful framework for discovering overlapping communities. Here we present a novel edge label propagation algorithm (ELPA), which combines the natural advantage of link communities with the efficiency of the label propagation algorithm (LPA). ELPA can discover both link communities and node communities. We evaluated ELPA on both synthetic and real-world networks, and compared it with five state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that ELPA performs competitively with other algorithms.","authors":["Wei Liu","Xingpeng Jiang","Matteo Pellegrini","Xiaofan Wang"],"meta":["March 2016Scientific Reports 6(1):22470","DOI:10.1038/srep22470"],"references":["264055586_Detecting_Communities_Based_on_Network_Topology","248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","321245909_The_structure_of_scientific_collaboration_networks","312970191_Scientific_collaboration_networks","283598027_Learning_to_discover_social_circles_in_ego_networks","267570472_CK-LPA_Efficient_community_detection_algorithm_based_on_label_propagation_with_community_kernel","265437445_Community_Structure_of_Complex_Networks","258309103_Discovering_link_communities_in_complex_networks_by_exploiting_link_dynamics","255959218_Efficient_discovery_of_overlapping_communities_in_massive_networks","244419758_Barabasi_AL_Hierarchical_organization_of_modularity_in_metabolic_networks"]}
