{"id":"325855817_Efficient_and_self-adaptive_in-situ_learning_in_multilayer_memristor_neural_networks","abstract":"Memristors with tunable resistance states are emerging building blocks of artificial neural networks. However, in situ learning on a large-scale multiple-layer memristor network has yet to be demonstrated because of challenges in device property engineering and circuit integration. Here we monolithically integrate hafnium oxide-based memristors with a foundry-made transistor array into a multiple-layer neural network. We experimentally demonstrate in situ learning capability and achieve competitive classification accuracy on a standard machine learning dataset, which further confirms that the training algorithm allows the network to adapt to hardware imperfections. Our simulation using the experimental parameters suggests that a larger network would further increase the classification accuracy. The memristor neural network is a promising hardware platform for artificial intelligence with high speed-energy efficiency.","authors":["Can Li","Daniel Belkin","Yunning Li","Peng Yan"],"meta":["June 2018Nature Communications 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-018-04484-2"],"references":["321492168_Analogue_signal_and_image_processing_with_large_memristor_crossbars","321160834_Neuromorphic_computing_with_multi-memristive_synapses","319856813_In-Datacenter_Performance_Analysis_of_a_Tensor_Processing_Unit","318814243_Multiscale_Co-Design_Analysis_of_Energy_Latency_Area_and_Accuracy_of_a_ReRAM_Analog_Neural_Training_Accelerator","317613363_In-Datacenter_Performance_Analysis_of_a_Tensor_Processing_Unit","322375977_Memristor-Based_Analog_Computation_and_Neural_Network_Classification_with_a_Dot_Product_Engine","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769906_Training_deep_neural_networks_with_low_precision_multiplications","319052537_Memristor-Based_Circuit_Design_for_Multilayer_Neural_Networks","317723001_Neuromorphic_technologies_for_next-generation_cognitive_computing","317171217_Face_classification_using_electronic_synapses","317088232_Training_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_Resistive_Cross-Point_Devices","317417531_Neuromorphic_Technologies_for_Next-Generation_Cognitive_Computing","317078153_Sparse_coding_with_memristor_networks","316447717_Experimental_Demonstration_of_Feature_Extraction_and_Dimensionality_Reduction_Using_Memristor_Networks"]}
