{"id":"332106031_Performance_Evaluation_of_Three_Quick_sorting_Algorithms_on_a_Single_and_Multi-core_Processors","abstract":"Multi-core processor is an improvement over the Single-core processor architecture and represents the latest developments in microprocessor technology. Performance evaluation of algorithms can be carried out on a computer with different number of processing cores with a view to establish the level of their performances. This research paper carried out performance evaluation studies on three different Sorting algorithms namely: QuickSort-Sequential, QuickSort-ParallelNaive, and QuickSort-ForkJoin on a Single-core and Multi-core processors to determine which of the algorithms has better execution time, and to show the effect of Multi-processor machines on their performances. System.nanotime() benchmark suits was used to measure the performances of these three algorithms. The overall running time of these algorithms were reported and compared. Results showed that the running time of QuickSort-ForkJoin is about 46.62% faster than QuickSort-Sequential, and 31.20% faster than QuickSort-ParallelNaive. Therefore, QuickSort-ForkJoin algorithm exhibits better performance probably due to its divide and conquer approach. Work stealing action is also another reason for this good performance when measured on both single and Multi-core processor. It was also discovered that increase in a number of processing cores in a machine significantly improves the performances of these algorithms.","authors":["Abbas Muhammad Rabiu","Ahmed Baita Garko","Aisha Muhammad Abdullahi","Hadiza Ali Umar"],"meta":["December 2018","Project: Effects of Munlticore Processors on Some Sorting and Searching Algorithms"],"references":["221537740_Introducing_computer_systems_from_a_programmer's_perspective","200039347_Computer_Architecture_-_A_Quantitative_Approach","236944300_Introduction_to_Parallel_Computing_2nd_Edition","39765372_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Vol_3_Sorting_and_Searching","31737724_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_in_Java_R_Lafore","4005912_A_Simple_Fast_Parallel_Implementation_of_Quicksort_And_Its_Performance_Evaluation_on_SUN_Enterprise_10000","3042565_Parallel_Quicksort_Using_Fetch-And-Add","2787737_Prefix_Sums_and_Their_Applications"]}
