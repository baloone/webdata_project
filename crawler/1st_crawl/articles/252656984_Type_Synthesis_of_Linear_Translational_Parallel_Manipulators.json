{"id":"252656984_Type_Synthesis_of_Linear_Translational_Parallel_Manipulators","abstract":"Abstract—Three-DOF linear TPMs (translational par- allel manipulators) refer to TPMs whose forward displace- ment analysis can be performed,by solving a set of linear equations. Based on the results of the type synthesis of TPMs, the method for the type synthesis of linear TPMs composed,of R (revolute) and P (prismatic) joints and the displacement group theory, this paper deals with the type synthesis of linear TPMs composed,of R and P and H (heli- cal) joints. A number,of linear TPMs and input-output de- coupled TPMs composed of R, P and H joints are revealed.
