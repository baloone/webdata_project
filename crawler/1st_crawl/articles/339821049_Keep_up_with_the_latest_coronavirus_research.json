{"id":"339821049_Keep_up_with_the_latest_coronavirus_research","abstract":"An open-resource literature hub known as LitCovid curates the most comprehensive collection of international research papers so far on the new coronavirus disease COVID-19 (see go.nature.com/3almd5p). Developed with the support of the US National Institutes of Health’s intramural research programme, LitCovid is updated daily with newly published articles. The aim is to provide timely insight from the scientific literature into the biology of the virus and the diagnosis and management of those who have been infected.\n\nLitCovid has a more sophisticated search function than existing resources. It identifies roughly 35% more relevant articles than do conventional keyword-based searches for entries such as ‘COVID-19’ or ‘nCOV’. Furthermore, the articles are categorized by topic — overview, disease mechanism, transmission dynamics, treatment, case report and epidemic forecasting — as well as by geographic location for visualization on a world map.\n\nWe welcome user feedback for further enhancement.","authors":["Qingyu Chen","Alexis Allot","Zhiyong lu"],"meta":["March 2020Nature 579(7798):193-193","DOI:10.1038/d41586-020-00694-1"],"references":[]}
