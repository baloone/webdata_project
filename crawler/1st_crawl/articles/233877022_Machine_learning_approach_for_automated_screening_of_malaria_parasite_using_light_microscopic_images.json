In doing this, microscopic image acquisition from stained slides, illumination correction and noise reduction, erythrocyte segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and finally classification of different stages of malaria (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum) have been investigated. The erythrocytes are segmented using marker controlled watershed transformation and subsequently total ninety six features describing shape-size and texture of erythrocytes are extracted in respect to the parasitemia infected versus non-infected cells. Ninety four features are found to be statistically significant in discriminating six classes. Here a feature selection-cum-classification scheme has been devised by combining F-statistic, statistical learning techniques i.e., Bayesian learning and support vector machine (SVM) in order to provide the higher classification accuracy using best set of discriminating features. Results show that Bayesian approach provides the highest accuracy i.e., 84% for malaria classification by selecting 19 most significant features while SVM provides highest accuracy i.e., 83.5% with 9 most significant features. Finally, the performance of these two classifiers under feature selection framework has been compared toward malaria parasite classification.","authors":["Dev Kumar Das","Madhumala Ghosh","Mallika Pal","Asok Maiti"],"meta":["November 2012Micron 45","DOI:10.1016/j.micron.2012.11.002","SourcePubMed"],"references":["302341151_Textural_Features_for_Image_Classification","251993319_Entropy_based_divergence_for_leukocyte_image_segmentation","251112010_A_Novel_Technique_For_Malaria_Diagnosis_Using_Invariant_Moments_And_By_Image_Compression","230837870_The_Morphological_Approach_to_Segmentation_The_Watershed_Transformation","226153372_Analysis_of_Detecting_the_Malarial_Parasite_Infected_Blood_Images_Using_Statistical_Based_Approach","224698301_Computer_Aided_Medical_Diagnosis_for_the_Identification_of_Malaria_Parasites","221260079_Malaria_Parasite_Detection_in_Peripheral_Blood_Images","44260536_Shannon_and_Non-Shannon_Measures_of_Entropy_for_Statistical_Texture_Feature_Extraction_in_Digitized_Mammograms","3326868_Texture_information_in_run-length_matrices","3115759_Haralick_RM_Shanmuga_K_Dinstein_ITextural_features_for_image_classification_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_3_610-621","3114284_Choudhuri_BB_An_Efficient_Differential_Box_Counting_Approach_to_Compute_Fractal_Dimension_of_Image_IEEE_Transactions_on_Syst_Man_and_Cybernetics_24_115-120","324427800_The_Fractal_Geometry_of_Nature","313081687_Texture_analysis_using_gray_level_run_lengths","305249498_Wintrobe's_clinical_hematology_Thirteenth_edition","283921280_Visual_Pattern_Recognition_by_Moment_Invariants","278727802_Morphological_Processing_of_Malarial_Slide_Images","272852301_Wintrobe's_Clinical_Hematology","267399468_Microscopic_determination_of_malaria_parasite_load_Role_of_image_analysis","255722725_Application_of_principal_component_analysis_to_ECG_signals_for_automated_diagnosis_of_cardiac_health","253868275_Removal_of_Speckle_Noise_from_Ultrasound_Medical_Image_based_on_Special_Filters_Comparative_Study","243002060_Texture_analysis_using_run_lengths","235902451_Data_Mining_Concept_and_Techniques","224225502_Invariant_moment_based_feature_analysis_for_abnormal_erythrocyte_recognition","223611056_Study_of_normal_ocular_thermogram_using_textural_parameters","222766313_Infrared_thermography_on_ocular_surface_temperature_A_review","222599334_Image_characterizations_based_on_joint_gray_level-run_length_distributions","220736791_Segmentation_of_malaria_parasites_in_peripheral_blood_smear_images","220646759_Use_of_Gray_Value_Distribution_of_Run_Length_for_Texture_Analysis","220601109_A_rule-based_approach_for_robust_clump_splitting","51555041_Textural_characterization_of_histopathological_images_for_oral_sub-mucous_fibrosis_detection","45630542_Statistical_Analysis_of_Textural_Features_for_Improved_Classification_of_Oral_Histopathological_Images","26259163_Malaria_Diagnosis_A_Brief_Review","23937288_A_semi-automatic_method_for_quantification_and_classification_of_erythrocytes_infected_with_malaria_parasites_in_microscopic_images","6948680_MalariaCount_An_image_analysis-based_program_for_the_accurate_determination_of_parasitemia","6851798_Automated_image_processing_method_for_the_diagnosis_and_classification_of_malaria_on_thin_blood_smears","4170066_Combining_gray_world_and_Retinex_theory_for_automatic_white_balance_in_digital_photography","3489274_Hu_MK_Visual_Pattern_Recognition_by_Moment_Invariants_IRE_Transaction_of_Information_Theory_IT-8","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns"]}
