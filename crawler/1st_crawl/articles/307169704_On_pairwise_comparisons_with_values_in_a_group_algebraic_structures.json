{"id":"307169704_On_pairwise_comparisons_with_values_in_a_group_algebraic_structures","abstract":"We describe the algebraic properties of pairwise comparisons matrices with coefficients in an arbitrary group. We provide a vocabulary adapted for the description of main algebaric properties of inconsistency maps, describe an example where the use of a non abelian group is necessary, and decribe a generalization of pairwise comparisons matrices and inconsistency maps on a graph.","authors":["Jean-Pierre Magnot"],"meta":["August 2016","Project: gauge theories, quantum gravity and decision theory"],"references":["320727436_A_Mathematical_Bridge_between_Discretized_Gauge_Theories_in_Quantum_Physics_and_Approximate_Reasoning_in_Pairwise_Comparisons","318029375_Remarks_on_a_New_Possible_Discretization_Scheme_for_Gauge_Theories","311953371_Studying_a_set_of_properties_of_inconsistency_indices_for_pairwise_comparisons","301790590_Computational_Proximity_Excursions_in_the_Topology_of_Digital_Images","297679077_Towards_a_Neuronal_Gauge_Theory","321942607_Axiomatization_of_Inconsistency_Indicators_for_Pairwise_Comparisons","321595545_Metric_Structures_for_Riemannian_and_Non-Riemannian_Spaces","319206939_On_normalization_of_inconsistency_indicators_in_pairwise_comparisons","290396142_A_Geometric_Framework_for_the_Inconsistency_in_Pairwise_Comparisons","287176059_Pairwise_Comparison_Matrices_over_Abelian_Linearly_Ordered_Groups_A_Consistency_Measure_and_Weights_for_the_Alternatives"]}
