{"id":"337650599_A_Foreword_from_the_Editor-in-Chief","abstract":"Over the past decades, Internet has gone beyond information sharing and communication, and become a platform for service reuse and service integration. Computing reuse based on abstraction and divide-and-conquer is at core of computer science and IT industry over the past decades, and the computing reuse granularity has grown from functions/methods to objects, reusable software components, and distributed cloud services. The maturity of container and microservice technologies makes both software system development and deployment truly distributed and reusable. The advancement in speed and security has now also enabled Internet to become an enterprise service integration platform that promote service reuse and management to an even higher level. “Internet +” is one of the layman’s terms to emphasize the new prominent function of Internet in local/regional/national/international scope enterprise service integration and reuse.","authors":["Lixin Tao"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Computer Science Research 1(3)","DOI:10.30564/jcsr.v1i3.1466"],"references":[]}
