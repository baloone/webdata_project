{"id":"318018036_Federated_database_systems_for_managing_distributed_heterogeneous_and_autonomous_databases","abstract":"A federated database system (FDBS) is a collection of cooperating database systems that are autonomous and possibly heterogeneous. In this paper, we define a reference architecture for distributed database management systems from system and schema viewpoints and show how various FDBS architectures can be developed. We then define a methodology for developing one of the popular architectures of an FDBS. Finally, we discuss critical issues related to developing and operating an FDBS.","authors":["J Larson","Amit Sheth"],"meta":["January 1990ACM Computing Surveys"],"references":[]}
