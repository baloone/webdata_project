{"id":"331590467_Analysis_of_DWT_DCT_BFO_PBFO_Algorithm_for_the_Purpose_of_Medical_Image_Watermarking","abstract":"Digital watermarking is a technique which is used to hide the ownership information in the digital media. Watermarking techniques have been developed to protect the copyright of multimedia objects such as text, audio, video, etc. This paper mainly focuses the necessity of medical image watermarking. In the field of medical science now image processing plays an important role and as a result watermarking is essential to provide the image security because telemedicine, electronic medicine, online medical report check by doctor is becoming popular. In this paper, Discrete wavelet transform, Discrete cosine transform, bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and particle swarm optimization has been applied and analyzed their performance for the purpose of watermarking the medical image. PSNR (Peak signal to noise ratio) value, NCC (normalized cross correlation) and IF (image fidelity) has been calculated to show the comparative performance of the applied algorithms. The value of PSNR and NCC must be high for good embedding of message.","authors":["Subrato Bharati","Mohammad Atikur Rahman","Prajoy Podder"],"meta":["March 2019","DOI:10.1109/CIET.2018.8660796","Conference: 2018 International Conference on Innovation in Engineering and Technology (ICIET)At: Dhaka, Bangladesh, Bangladesh","Project: Digital Image Processing"],"references":["280298280_Advanced_Techniques_in_Multimedia_Watermarking_Image_Video_and_Audio_Applications","280029739_Multi-objective_Swarm_Intelligence_Theoretical_Advances_and_Applications","257744056_Multimodal_Biometric_Authentication_using_PSO_based_Watermarking","322616476_Color_Image_Watermarking_Algorithms_and_Technologies","321681925_Cosine-Sine-Modulated_Filter_Banks_General_Properties_Fast_Algorithms_and_Integer_Approximations","306234426_Discrete_Wavelet_Transform_A_Signal_Processing_Approach","283395251_Discrete_Cosine_and_Sine_Transforms","281863506_Image_Processing_and_Pattern_Recognition_Fundamentals_and_Techniques_Wiley-IEEE_Press","264386169_Optimized_gray-scale_image_watermarking_using_DWT-SVD_and_Firefly_Algorithm","263606329_Digital_Watermarking_and_Steganography","252892249_Transactions_on_Computational_Science_VIII","252023184_Digital_Image_Watermarking_by_Using_Discrete_Wavelet_Transform_and_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_and_Comparison_Based_on_PSNR"]}
