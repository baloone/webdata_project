{"id":"283864128_Efficient_BER_simulation_of_orthogonal_space-time_block_codes_in_Nakagami-m_fading","abstract":"In this contribution, we present a simple but efficient importance sampling technique to speed up Monte Carlo simulations for bit error rate estimation of orthogonal space-time block codes on spatially correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. While maintaining the actual distributions for the channel noise and the data symbols, we derive a convenient biased distribution for the fading channel that is shown to result in impressive efficiency gains up to multIPle orders of magnitude.","authors":["Lennert Jacobs","Marc Moeneclaey"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136250"],"references":["227446046_Importance_Sampling_for_Stochastic_Simulations","224219076_Analysis_and_Efficient_Evaluation_of_the_BER_of_OSTBCs_With_Imperfect_Channel_Estimation_in_Arbitrarily_Correlated_Fading_Channels","224166168_BER_analysis_of_square_OSTBCs_with_LMMSE_channel_estimation_in_arbitrarily_correlated_Rayleigh_fading_channels","220129842_New_results_for_the_multivariate_Nakagami-_fading_model_with_arbitrary_correlation_matrix_and_applications","3233160_Improved_Importance_Sampling_Technique_for_Efficient_Simulation_of_Digital_Communication_Systems","251782112_CQ_importance_sampling_technique_for_efficient_simulation_in_Rayleigh-faded_channels","239060991_The_m-Distribution-A_General_Formula_of_Intensity_Distribution_of_Rapid_Fading","224732450_A_Modified_Monte-Carlo_Simulation_Technique_for_the_Evaluation_of_Error_Rate_in_Digital_Communication_Systems","224692577_Importance_Sampling_Simulation_of_Orthogonal_Space-Time_Block_Coded_Systems","224624475_Application_of_Irnportance_Sarnpling_for_Sinulation_of_Orthogonal_Space-Time_Block_Coded_Systens","3874548_A_Stochastic_Multiple_Input_Multiple_Output_Radio_Channel_Model_for_Evalation_of_Space-Time_Coding_Algorithms","3233845_A_stochastic_importance_sampling_methodology_for_the_efficient_simulation_of_adaptive_systems_in_frequency_nonselective_Rayleigh_fading_channels","3079854_Space-Time_Block_Codes_from_Orthogonal_Designs"]}
