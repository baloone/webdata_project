{"id":"346259795_Deep_learning_for_UV_absorption_spectra_with_SchNarc_First_steps_toward_transferability_in_chemical_compound_space","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) has shown to advance the research field of quantum chemistry in almost any possible direction and has also recently been applied to investigate the multifaceted photochemistry of molecules. In this paper, we pursue two goals: (i) We show how ML can be used to model permanent dipole moments for excited states and transition dipole moments by adapting the charge model of Gastegger et al. [Chem. Sci. 8, 6924-6935 (2017)], which was originally proposed for the permanent dipole moment vector of the electronic ground state. (ii) We investigate the transferability of our excited-state ML models in chemical space, i.e., whether an ML model can predict the properties of molecules that it has never been trained on and whether it can learn the different excited states of two molecules simultaneously. To this aim, we employ and extend our previously reported SchNarc approach for excited-state ML. We calculate UV absorption spectra from excited-state energies and transition dipole moments as well as electrostatic potentials from latent charges inferred by the ML model of the permanent dipole moment vectors. We train our ML models on CH2NH2+ and C2H4, while predictions are carried out for these molecules and additionally for CHNH2, CH2NH, and C2H5+. The results indicate that transferability is possible for the excited states.","authors":["J. Westermayr","P.
