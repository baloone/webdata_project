{"id":"319319686_K9-Blyzer_-_Towards_Video-Based_Automatic_Analysis_of_Canine_Behavior","abstract":"Automatic analysis of animal behavior has the potential to revolutionize the work of animal science and ACI researchers. Many tracking and behavior analysis systems exist for different species, such as birds, insects and mice, but behavior analysis in the canine domain still remains a challenging task. In this research-in-progress paper we describe K9-Blyzer (Canine Behavior Analyzer), which is a tool for automatic video analysis of canine behavior. We present preliminary results of automatic analysis of dog-robot interactions, point out some envisioned extensions of the tool and discuss the potential applications of the tool for the field of ACI.","authors":["Shir Amir","Anna Zamansky","Dirk van der Linden"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3152130.3152142","Conference: ACI2017"],"references":["316611322_A_Report_on_the_First_International_Workshop_on_Research_Methods_in_Animal-Computer_Interaction","311621957_Designing_for_wearability_in_animal_biotelemetry","281200461_An_Investigation_on_Social_Representations_Inanimate_Agent_Can_Mislead_Dogs_Canis_familiaris_in_a_Food_Choice_Task","258704127_Identification_of_Behaviour_in_Freely_Moving_Dogs_Canis_familiaris_Using_Inertial_Sensors","256470829_What_Are_You_or_Who_Are_You_The_Emergence_of_Social_Interaction_between_Dog_and_an_Unidentified_Moving_Object_UMO","311622272_Dog-drone_interactions_towards_an_ACI_perspective","311622016_Semi-supervised_classification_of_static_canine_postures_using_the_Microsoft_Kinect","281200628_Dogs_rapidly_develop_socially_competent_behaviour_while_interacting_with_a_contingently_responding_self-propelled_object","261274951_Behavior_recognition_based_on_machine_learning_algorithms_for_a_wireless_canine_machine_interface","241082758_Development_of_a_real-time_computer_vision_system_for_tracking_loose-housed_pigs"]}
