{"id":"319241563_Vertex_Degrees_and_Isomorphic_Properties_in_Complement_of_an_m_-Polar_Fuzzy_Graph","abstract":"Computational intelligence and computer science rely on graph theory to solve combinatorial problems. Normal product and tensor product of an m -polar fuzzy graph have been introduced in this article. Degrees of vertices in various product graphs, like Cartesian product, composition, tensor product, and normal product, have been computed. Complement and Î¼ -complement of an m -polar fuzzy graph are defined and some properties are studied. An application of an m -polar fuzzy graph is also presented in this article.","authors":["Ch.
