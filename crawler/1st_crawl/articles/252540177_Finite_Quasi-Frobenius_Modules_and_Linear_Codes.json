{"id":"252540177_Finite_Quasi-Frobenius_Modules_and_Linear_Codes","abstract":"The theory of linear codes over nite elds has been extended by A. Nechaev to codes over quasi-Frobenius modules over commutative rings, and by J. Wood to codes over (not necessarily commutative) nite Frobenius rings. In the present paper we subsume these results by studying linear codes over quasi-Frobenius and Frobenius modules over any nite ring. Using the character module of the ring as alphabet we show that fundamental results like MacWilliams' theorems on weight enumerators and code isometry can be obtained in this general setting.","authors":["Marcus Greferath","Alexandr Nechaev","Robert Wisbauer"],"meta":["November 2011Journal of Algebra and Its Applications 03(03)","DOI:10.1142/S0219498804000873"],"references":["321610314_Algebra_II_Ring_Theory","309103902_Weighted_modules_and_representations_of_codes","287335780_Mathematische_Leitfaden","279957852_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","270392825_A_Duality_Theory_for_Injective_Modules_Theory_of_Quasi-Frobenius_Modules","268999961_Grundlagen_der_Modul-_und_Ringtheorie_Ein_Handbuch_fur_Studium_und_Forschung_Foundations_of_module_and_ring_theory_A_handbook_for_study_and_research","268634698_Duality_For_Modules_Over_Finite_Rings_And_Applications_To_Coding_Theory","268620286_Combinatorial_Theory","267137523_On_the_general_theory_of_Mobius_inversion_formula_and_Mobius_product","267056510_Finite_associative_rings"]}
