{"id":"222563000_On_state_representations_of_time-varying_nonlinear_systems","abstract":"This work considers a nonlinear time-varying system described by a state representation, with input u and state x. A given set of functions v, which is not necessarily the original input u of the system, is the (new) input candidate. The main result provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a local classical state space representation with input v. These conditions rely on integrability tests that are based on a derived flag. As a byproduct, one obtains a sufficient condition of differential flatness of nonlinear systems.","authors":["PAULO SERGIO Pereira da Silva","Simone Batista"],"meta":["May 2009Automatica 45(5):1260-1264","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2008.12.025","SourceDBLP"],"references":["266753596_Dynamic_feedback_linearization_and_Lie-Backlund_transformations","265955769_Relative_Flatness_and_Flatness_of_Implicit_Systems","260402523_An_infinite_dimensional_differential-geometric_approach_for_nonlinear_systems_Part_II_-System_Theory","257387744_Equivalence_of_Different_Realization_Methods_for_Higher_Order_Nonlinear_Input-Output_Differential_Equations","253935771_Discussion_on_''Equivalence_of_Different_Realization_Methods_for_Higher_Order_Nonlinear_Input-Output_Differential_Equations","246698695_Linearisation_par_bouclage_dynamique_et_transformations_de_Lie-Backlund","290693855_Input-output_equivalence_of_nonlinear_systems_and_their_realizations","269259529_Input-output_equivalence_of_nonlinear_systems_and_their_realizations","267014265_On_Linearization_of_Control_Systems","266513204_Transformations_and_Representations_of_Nonlinear_Systems"]}
