{"id":"259540606_Complexity_and_Approximability_of_the_k-Way_Vertex_Cut","abstract":"In this article, we consider k-way vertex cut: the problem of finding a graph separator of a given size that decomposes the graph into the maximum number of components. Our main contribution is the derivation of an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem on planar graphs. Also, we show that k-way vertex cut is polynomially solvable on graphs of bounded treewidth and fixed–parameter tractable on planar graphs with the size of the separator as the parameter. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","authors":["André Berger","Alexander Grigoriev","Ruben van der Zwaan"],"meta":["March 2014Networks 63(2)","DOI:10.1002/net.21534"],"references":["225447052_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","222537142_Cutting_Up_Is_Hard_To_Do_The_Parameterised_Complexity_of_k-Cut_and_Related_Problems","220908240_How_to_Cut_a_Graph_into_Many_Pieces","220617696_The_Complexity_of_Multiterminal_Cuts","220544229_Simple_and_Improved_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Multiterminal_Cuts","220368020_Cutting_Up_is_Hard_to_Do_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_k-Cut_and_Related_Problems","48194971_The_Minimum_k-way_Cut_of_Bounded_Size_is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","47524316_Multicut_is_FPT","2795827_A_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Finding","2456242_A_New_Approach_to_the_Minimum_Cut_Problem","277473416_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Small_Treewidth","267464508_Improved_parameterized_algorithm_for_the_multicut_problem","250956284_An_O_V_2_Algorithm_for_the_Planar_3Cut_Problem","243659375_A_Polynomial_Algorithm_for_the_k-cut_Problem_for_Fixed_k","229157396_Designing_FPT_Algorithms_for_Cut_Problems_Using_Randomized_Contractions","228057551_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Dense_Instances_of_NP-Hard_Problems","222833198_Multicuts_in_unweighted_graphs_and_digraphs_with_bounded_degree_and_bounded_tree-width","222830024_Multiway_cuts_in_node_weighted_graphs","222540859_Complexity_and_exact_algorithms_for_vertex_multicut_in_interval_and_bounded_treewidth_graphs","222405647_Minimal_multicut_and_maximal_integer_multiflow_A_survey","222305559_A_Partial_K-Arboretum_of_Graphs_With_Bounded_Treewidth","221591179_Minimum_K-way_cuts_via_deterministic_greedy_tree","221499567_Finding_k_Cuts_within_Twice_the_Optimal","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220617401_Ruling_Out_PTAS_for_Graph_Min-Bisection_Dense_k-Subgraph_and_Bipartite_Clique","220616609_A_Deterministic_Algorithm_for_Finding_All_Minimum_k_-Way_Cuts","220574580_An_Improved_Approximation_Algorithm_for","220430558_Efficient_Planarity_Testing","220406609_An_Improved_Algorithm_for_the_Planar_3-Cut_Problem","220297001_A_note_on_the_bounded_fragmentation_property_and_its_applications_in_network_reliability","220223596_Primal-Dual_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Integral_Flow_and_Multicut_in_Trees","220138821_Linear_Degree_Extractors_and_the_Inapproximability_of_Max_Clique_and_Chromatic_Number","51915737_On_Multiway_Cut_Parameterized_above_Lower_Bounds","47438585_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_of_Multicut_Parameterized_by_the_Size_of_the_Cutset","4354989_Approximation_algorithms_for_NP-complete_problems_on_planar_graphs","2939706_Parameterized_Graph_Separation_Problems","2865502_Multicuts_in_Unweighted_Graphs_and_Digraphs_with_Bounded_Degree_and_Bounded_Tree-Width","2402901_An_Improved_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Multiway_Cut"]}
