{"id":"228880433_Three_Years_of_Experience_with_Sledgehammer_a_Practical_Link_between_Automatic_and_Interactive_Theorem_Provers","abstract":"Sledgehammer is a highly successful subsystem of Isabelle/HOL that calls automatic theorem provers to assist with interactive proof construction. It requires no user configuration: it can be invoked with a single mouse gesture at any point in a proof. It automatically finds relevant lemmas from all those currently available. An unusual aspect of its architecture is its use of unsound translations, coupled with its delivery of results as Isabelle/HOL proof scripts: its output cannot be trusted, but it does not need to be trusted. Sledgehammer works well with Isar structured proofs and allows beginners to prove challenging theorems.","authors":["Lawrence Paulson","Jasmin Christian Blanchette"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.29007/tnfd","Conference: 8th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics (IWIL-2010)"],"references":["267468094_Proof_development_with_OMEGA_the_irrationality_of_2","239829789_LEO-II_-_A_Cooperative_Automatic_Theorem_Prover_for_Classical_Higher-Order_Logic","285940098_Lightweight_relevance_filtering_for_machine-generated_resolution_problems","266362282_Tool_Support_for_Logics_of_Programs","263303592_Automated_Proof_Construction_in_Type_Theory_Using_Resolution","255663618_Handbook_of_Automated_Reasoning_in_2_volumes","249764848_IsabelleIsar_-_a_generic_framework_for_human-readable_proof_documents","230625839_Introduction_to_HOL_A_Theorem_Proving_Environment_for_Higher_Order_Logic","228756970_First-order_proof_tactics_in_higher-order_logic_theorem_provers","228749686_Integrated_proof_transformation_services"]}
