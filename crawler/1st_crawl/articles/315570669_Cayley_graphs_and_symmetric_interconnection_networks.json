{"id":"315570669_Cayley_graphs_and_symmetric_interconnection_networks","abstract":"These lecture notes are on automorphism groups of Cayley graphs and their applications to optimal fault-tolerance of some interconnection networks. We first give an introduction to automorphisms of graphs and an introduction to Cayley graphs. We then discuss automorphism groups of Cayley graphs. We prove that the vertex-connectivity of edge-transitive graphs is maximum possible. We investigate the automorphism group and vertex-connectivity of some families of Cayley graphs that have been considered for interconnection networks; we focus on the hypercubes, folded hypercubes, Cayley graphs generated by transpositions, and Cayley graphs from linear codes. New questions and open problems are also discussed.","authors":["Ashwin Ganesan"],"meta":["March 2017","Project: Automorphism groups of Cayley graphs"],"references":["297047487_On_the_automorphism_group_of_cayley_graphs_generated_by_transpositions","284219482_Edge-Transitivity_of_Cayley_Graphs_Generated_by_Transpositions","281394898_Structure_of_the_automorphism_group_of_the_augmented_cube_graph","312628479_Circulants_and_their_connectivities","307955917_Zur_allgemeinen_kurventheorie","292216186_On_the_Performance_of_k-ary_n-cube_Interconnection_Networks","272393240_Symmetric_Property_and_Reliability_of_Balanced_Hypercube","268073588_The_full_automorphism_group_of_Cayley_graphs_of_Z_p_Z_p_2","266182033_Topics_in_graph_theory_Graphs_and_their_Cartesian_product","266168389_Contemporary_Abstract_Algebra"]}
