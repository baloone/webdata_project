Two classes taught by different mathematics teachers participated. The mean of the posttest scores for the experimental group in which the teachers developed lessons using Bloom's Taxonomy would be significantly higher than the mean of the group which used textbook bound instruction. An analysis of covariance was conducted, and the hypothesis was rejected. The experimental group would yield significant gains as measured by the difference between the pretest and posttest scores. The hypothesis was retained as a result of a paired-samples t-test.","authors":["Kristel Williams Hawks"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
