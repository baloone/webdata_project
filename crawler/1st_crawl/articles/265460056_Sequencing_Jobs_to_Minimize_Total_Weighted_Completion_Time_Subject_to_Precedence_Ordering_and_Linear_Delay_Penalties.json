{"id":"265460056_Sequencing_Jobs_to_Minimize_Total_Weighted_Completion_Time_Subject_to_Precedence_Ordering_and_Linear_Delay_Penalties","abstract":"Suppose n jobs are to be sequenced for processing by a single machine, with the object of minimizing total weighted completion time. It is shown that the problem is NP-complete if there are arbitrary precedence constraints. However, if precedence constraints are \"series parallel\", the problem can be solved in O(n log n) time. This result generalizes previous results for the more special case of rooted trees. It is also shown how a decomposition procedure suggested by Sidney can be implemented in polynomial-bounded time. Equivalence of the sequencing problem with the optimal linear ordering problem for directed graphs is discussed.","authors":["E.L.
