{"id":"45865195_Contextuality_in_Measurement-based_Quantum_Computation","abstract":"We show, under natural assumptions for qubit systems, that measurement-based\nquantum computations (MBQCs) which compute a non-linear Boolean function with\nhigh probability are contextual. The class of contextual MBQCs includes an\nexample which is of practical interest and has a super-polynomial speedup over\nthe best known classical algorithm, namely the quantum algorithm that solves\nthe Discrete Log problem.","authors":["Robert Raussendorf"],"meta":["July 2009Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 88(2)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.88.022322","SourcearXiv","Project: Contextuality as a resource in quantum computation"],"references":["302142233_The_Problem_of_Hidden_Variables_in_Quantum_Mechanics","291771926_Bell's_Theorem_Quantum_Theory_and_Conceptions_of_the_Universe","277047365_Exact_quantum_Fourier_transforms_and_discrete_logarithm_algorithms","267660341_Divisible_Codes_-_A_Survey","267090773_A_suggested_interpretation_of_the_quantum_theory_in_terms_of_hidden_variables_I_II","265367620_The_Problem_of_Hidden_Variables_in_Quantum_Theory","265351208_Zeroes_of_Polynomials_Over_Finite_Fields","263907026_EXACT_QUANTUM_FOURIER_TRANSFORMS_AND_DISCRETE_LOGARITHM_ALGORITHMS","252923968_Quantum_computations_Algorithms_and_error_correction","251277384_Can_Quantum-Mechanical_Description_of_Physical_Reality_Be_Considered_both_Complete_and_Local"]}
