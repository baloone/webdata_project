{"id":"327603696_AMACE_agent_based_multi-criterions_adaptation_in_cloud_environment","abstract":"Efcient resource management in dynamic cloud computing is receiving more and \nmore attentions. Many works are still ongoing, since federated cloud computing is an \nopen environment. We present in this paper a fexible model, new cloud operators \ncan join the federation or leave it. The model integrates interactions between broker \nagents organization, permitting a multi-criterion migration of a submitted customer \nrequest. To implement the presented fexible model, we propose AMACE (agent based \nmulti-criterions adaptation in cloud environment) a run-time self-adaptive approach, \noriented agent in dynamic cloud federation environment. The proposed approach is \nmulti-criterion, where a various and no limited number of parameters can be con-\nsidered during the self-adaptation strategy (i.e. computing the load balance of the \nmediator agent and geographical distance “network delay” between the customer \nand provider…). In addition, AMACE cares about maintaining run-time coherence in \noptimization evolution in order to guarantee a coherent system at all moment during \nsystem execution.","authors":["Kemchi Sofiane","Abdelhafid Zitouni","Mahieddine Djoudi"],"meta":["December 2018Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences 8(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13673-018-0149-2","Projects: Information Security in Cloud ComputingInformation Security in Cloud Computing"],"references":["326565826_A_self-organized_resource_provisioning_for_cloud_block_storage","319470928_Adaptive_resource_provisioning_method_using_application-aware_machine_learning_based_on_job_history_in_heterogeneous_infrastructures","310049227_Distributed_resource_allocation_in_federated_clouds","321370110_ARMM_Adaptive_Resource_Management_Model_for_Workflow_Execution_in_Clouds","316415137_Federating_Advanced_Cyberinfrastructures_with_Autonomic_Capabilities","314593397_Dynamic_Load_Sharing_to_Maximize_Resource_Utilization_Within_Cloud_Federation","314109879_Performance_analysis_of_multi-institutional_data_sharing_in_the_Clouds4Coordination_system","313784391_An_autonomic_resource_provisioning_approach_for_service-based_cloud_applications_A_hybrid_approach","311530618_Self-Optimising_Decentralised_Service_Placement_in_Heterogeneous_Cloud_Federation","308602402_Resource_Management_Based_on_Agent_Technology_in_Cloud_Computing"]}
