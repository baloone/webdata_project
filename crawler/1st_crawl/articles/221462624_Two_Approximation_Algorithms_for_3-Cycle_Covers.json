{"id":"221462624_Two_Approximation_Algorithms_for_3-Cycle_Covers","abstract":"A cycle cover of a directed graph is a collection of node disjoint cycles such that every node is part of exactly one cycle. A k-cycle cover is a cycle cover in which every cycle has length at least k. While deciding whether a directed graph has a 2-cycle cover is solvable in polynomial time, deciding whether it has a 3-cycle cover is already NP-complete. Given a directed graph with nonnegative edge weights, a maximum weight 2-cycle cover can be computed in polynomial time, too. We call the corresponding optimization problem of finding a maximum weight 3-cycle cover Max-3-DCC.\nIn this paper we present two polynomial time approximation algorithms for Max-3-DCC. The heavier of the 3-cycle covers computed by these algorithms has at least a fraction of \\(\n\\frac{3}\n{5} - \\in\n\\)\nfor any ∈> 0, of the weight of a maximum weight 3-cycle cover.\nAs a lower bound, we prove that Max-3-DCC is APX-complete, even if the weights fulfil the triangle inequality.","authors":["Markus Bläser","Bodo Manthey"],"meta":["September 2002Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45753-4_6","SourceDBLP","Conference: Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization, 5th International Workshop, APPROX 2002, Rome, Italy, September 17-21, 2002, Proceedings"],"references":["283559921_Paths_trees_flowers","256157863_A_matching_problem_with_side_conditions","245277344_An_algorithm_with_an_estimate_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem_of_the_maximum","239344419_A_Short_Proof_of_the_Factor_Theorem_for_Finite_Graphs","230596039_Matching_theory","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","227656765_On_the_worst-case_performance_of_some_algorithms_for_the_asymmetric_traveling_salesman_problem","223115669_Some_APX-completeness_results_for_cubic_graphs","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","222470961_Optimization_Approximation_and_Complexity_Classes","221316849_The_Square-Free_2-Factor_Problem_in_Bipartite_Graphs","220770624_Computing_Cycle_Covers_without_Short_Cycles","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220690835_Network_Flows_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","220075987_An_extension_of_matching_theory"]}
