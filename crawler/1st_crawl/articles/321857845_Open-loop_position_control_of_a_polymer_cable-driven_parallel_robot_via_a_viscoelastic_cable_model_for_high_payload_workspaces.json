{"id":"321857845_Open-loop_position_control_of_a_polymer_cable-driven_parallel_robot_via_a_viscoelastic_cable_model_for_high_payload_workspaces","abstract":"A polymer cable–driven parallel robot has a wide range of potential industrial applications by virtue of its light actuator dynamics, high payload capability, and large workspace. However, due to a viscoelastic behavior of polymer cable and difficulty in actual cable length measurement, there have been inevitable position and tracking control accuracy problems such as pick and place a high payload application. In this article, to overcome control problem, we propose a model-based open-loop control with the cable elongation compensation via experimentally driven cable model and switching control logic without additional Cartesian space feedback signal. The approach suggests a five-element cable model that is made with series combination of a linear spring and two Voigt models as a function of payload and cable length that are available to be measured in real-time. Experimental results show that using the suggested method, the cable length error due to viscoelastic effect can be compensated, and thus the position control accuracy of the polymer cable–driven parallel robot improved remarkably especially in gravity direction.","authors":["Jinlong Piao","XueJun Jin","Jinwoo Jung","Eunpyo Choi"],"meta":["December 2017Advances in Mechanical Engineering 9(12):168781401773719","DOI:10.1177/1687814017737199"],"references":["316461784_Dynamics_and_Control_of_a_6-dof_Cable-driven_Parallel_Robot_with_Visco-elastic_Cables_in_Presence_of_Measurement_Noise","315387285_Dynamic_model_and_workspace_analysis_of_novel_incompletely_restrained_cable-suspension_swing_system_driven_by_two_cables","303885676_Hysteresis_model_of_longitudinally_loaded_cable_for_cable_driven_robots_and_identification_of_the_parameters","288777637_Dynamic_analysis_and_control_of_cable_driven_robots_with_elastic_cables","282849057_On_the_Forward_Kinematics_of_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","273494265_Optimal_Orientation_Planning_and_Control_Deviation_Estimation_on_FAST_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robot","313113544_Cable_configuration_analysis_to_increase_the_rotational_range_of_suspended_6-DOF_cable_driven_parallel_robots","305750473_Adaptive_control_for_space_debris_removal_with_uncertain_kinematics_dynamics_and_states","284174899_A_Versatile_Tension_Distribution_Algorithm_for_n-DOF_Parallel_Robots_Driven_by_n2_Cables","283288028_An_experimental_study_on_the_vision-based_control_and_identification_of_planar_cable-driven_parallel_robots"]}
