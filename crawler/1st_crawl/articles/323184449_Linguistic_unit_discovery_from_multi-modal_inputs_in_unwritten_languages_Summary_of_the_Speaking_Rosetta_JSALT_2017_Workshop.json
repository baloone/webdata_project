{"id":"323184449_Linguistic_unit_discovery_from_multi-modal_inputs_in_unwritten_languages_Summary_of_the_Speaking_Rosetta_JSALT_2017_Workshop","abstract":"We summarize the accomplishments of a multi-disciplinary workshop exploring the computational and scientific issues surrounding the discovery of linguistic units (subwords and words) in a language without orthography. We study the replacement of orthographic transcriptions by images and/or translated text in a well-resourced language to help unsupervised discovery from raw speech.","authors":["Odette Scharenborg","Laurent Besacier","Alan Black","Mark Hasegawa-Johnson"],"meta":["February 2018","Project: Low-resource automatic speech recognition"],"references":["320322031_A_Very_Low_Resource_Language_Speech_Corpus_for_Computational_Language_Documentation_Experiments","320030446_SPEECH-COCO_600k_Visually_Grounded_Spoken_Captions_Aligned_to_MSCOCO_Data_Set","311278794_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Spoken_Language_with_Visual_Context","304407628_Deep_multimodal_semantic_embeddings_for_speech_and_images","354165562_A_comparative_study_of_BNF_and_DNN_multilingual_training_on_cross-lingual_low-resource_speech_recognition","322710213_The_zero_resource_speech_challenge_2017","322706871_Unwritten_languages_demand_attention_too_Word_discovery_with_encoder-decoder_models","322465846_Evaluating_speech_features_with_the_Minimal-Pair_ABX_task_II_Resistance_to_noise","319185738_Sequence-to-Sequence_Models_Can_Directly_Translate_Foreign_Speech","318740990_Representations_of_language_in_a_model_of_visually_grounded_speech_signal"]}
