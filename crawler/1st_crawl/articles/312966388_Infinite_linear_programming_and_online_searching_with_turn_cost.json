{"id":"312966388_Infinite_linear_programming_and_online_searching_with_turn_cost","abstract":"We consider the problem of searching for a hidden target in an environment that consists of a set of concurrent rays. Every time the searcher turns direction, it incurs a fixed cost. The objective is to derive a search strategy for locating the target as efficiently as possible, and the performance of the strategy is evaluated by means of the well-established competitive ratio. In this paper we revisit an approach due to Demaine et al. [TCS 2006] based on infinite linear-programming formulations of this problem. We first demonstrate that their definition of duality in infinite LPs can lead to erroneous results. We then provide a non-trivial correction which establishes the optimality of a certain round-robin search strategy.","authors":["Spyros Angelopoulos","Diogo Arsénio","Christoph Dürr"],"meta":["January 2017Theoretical Computer Science 670(7)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.01.013"],"references":["242912284_Minimax_Solutions_for_Linear_Search_Problems","30848681_Duality_in_infinite_dimensional_linear_programming","2729110_Algorithms_for_Informed_Cows","285320254_Online_searching","275064283_An_Optimal_Search","270913229_Searching_on_a_line_A_complete_characterization_of_the_optimal_solution","257285777_Searching_in_the_Plane","229473841_The_search_game_on_a_network_with_immobile_hider","225942283_Duality_gaps_in_semi-infinite_linear_programming-an_approximation_problem","225757698_Yet_More_on_the_Linear_Search_Problem","225363679_On_the_Linear_Search_Problem","225176531_A_Lower_Bound_for_Randomized_Searching_on_mRays","225133363_Hyperbolic_Dovetailing","223711333_The_ultimate_strategy_to_search_on_rays","223444724_Optimal_Constructions_of_Hybrid_Algorithms","223322950_On-line_parallel_heuristics_processor_scheduling_and_robot_searching_under_the_competitive_framework","222678896_Online_Searching_with_Turn_Cost","220770245_The_Oil_Searching_Problem","2456737_Searching_in_an_Unknown_Environment_An_Optimal_Randomized_Algorithm_for_the_Cow-Path_Problem"]}
