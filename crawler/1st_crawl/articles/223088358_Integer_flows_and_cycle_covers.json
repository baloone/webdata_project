{"id":"223088358_Integer_flows_and_cycle_covers","abstract":"Results related to integer flows and cycle covers are presented. A cycle cover of a graph G is a collection of cycles of G which covers all edges of G; is called a cycle m-cover of G if each edge of G is covered exactly m times by the members of . By using Seymour's nowhere-zero 6-flow theorem, we prove that every bridgeless graph has a cycle 6-cover associated to covering of the edges by 10 even subgraphs (an even graph is one in which each vertex is of even degree). This result together with the cycle 4-cover theorem implies that every bridgeless graph has a cycle m-cover for any even number m ≥ 4. We also prove that every graph with a nowhere-zero 4-flow has a cycle cover such that the sum of lengths of the cycles in is at most |E(G)| + |V(G)| − 2, unless G belongs to a very special class of graphs.","authors":["Genghua Fan"],"meta":["January 1992Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 54(1):113-122","DOI:10.1016/0095-8956(92)90069-A","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["220898525_Covering_a_Graph_by_Circuits","268997481_Sums_of_circuits","268854206_On_the_minimum_weighted_cycle_covering_problem_for_planar_graphs","265370658_A_Class_of_Abelian_Groups","256391916_Nowhere-Zero_6-flows","250956239_Covering_Multigraphs_by_Simple_Circuits","247014338_On_nowhere-zero_flows_in_multigraphs","246773956_Matching_and_a_polyhedron_with_O-1_vertices","243775617_Polyhedral_decomposition_of_cubic_graphs","242499241_Maximum_matching_and_a_polyhedron_with_01-vertices","239064938_A_Contribution_to_the_Theory_of_Chromatic_Polynomials","229705546_A_Note_on_Sub-Eulerian_Graphs","226048663_Blocking_and_Anti-Blocking_Pairs_of_Polyhedra","222875555_Cycle_covering_in_bridgeless_graphs","222601671_Shortest_covering_of_graphs_with_cycles","222361007_Flows_and_generalized_Coloring_Theorems_in_graphs","220076439_Covering_weighted_graphs_by_even_subgraphs","35101035_On_cubic_graphs_that_do_not_have_an_edge_3-colouring_microform","31031045_On_Multi-Colourings_of_Cubic_Graphs_and_Conjectures_of_Fulkerson_and_Tutte"]}
