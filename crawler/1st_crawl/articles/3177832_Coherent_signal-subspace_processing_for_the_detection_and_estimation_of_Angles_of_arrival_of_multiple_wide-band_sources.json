{"id":"3177832_Coherent_signal-subspace_processing_for_the_detection_and_estimation_of_Angles_of_arrival_of_multiple_wide-band_sources","abstract":"This paper presents a method of constructing a single signal subspace for high-resolution estimation of the angles of arrival of multiple wide-band plane waves. The technique relies on an approximately coherent combination of the spatial signal spaces of the temporally narrow-band decomposition of the received signal vector from an array of sensors. The algorithm is presented, and followed by statistical simulation examples. The performance of the technique is contrasted with other suggested methods and statistical bounds in terms of the determination of the correct number of sources (detection), bias, and variance of estimates of the angles.","authors":["H.
