{"id":"338530755_Circular_Chromatic_Number_of_Planar_Graphs_of_Large_Odd_Girth","abstract":"It was conjectured by Jaeger that $4k$-edge connected graphs admit a $(2k+1, k)$-flow. The restriction of this conjecture to planar graphs is equivalent to the statement that planar graphs of girth at least $4k$ have circular chromatic number at most $2+ {{1}\\over {k}}$. Even this restricted version of Jaeger's conjecture is largely open. The $k=1$ case is the well-known Gr√∂tzsch 3-colour theorem. This paper proves that for $k \\geq 2$, planar graphs of odd girth at least $8k-3$ have circular chromatic number at most $2+{{1}\\over {k}}$.","authors":["Xuding Zhu"],"meta":["June 2001The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 8(1):R25","DOI:10.37236/1569"],"references":[]}
