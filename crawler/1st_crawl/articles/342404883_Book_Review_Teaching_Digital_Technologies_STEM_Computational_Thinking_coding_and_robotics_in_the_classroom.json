Despite the increased momentum and inclusion of CT in several significant areas of curriculum internationally, little has been published for educators who wish to incorporate these increasingly important computer science related skills, knowledge and attitudes in their classroom practices. Teaching Digital Technologies & STEM: Computational Thinking, coding and robotics in the classroom provides practical strategies and a variety of teaching tools for developing Computational Thinking skills in K-12 students.","authors":["Michael Kolodziej"],"meta":["December 2016Issues and Trends in Educational Technology 4(2)","DOI:10.2458/azu_itet_v4i2_kolodziej"],"references":[]}
