{"id":"342642327_Dynamic_Speed_Scaling_Minimizing_Expected_Energy_Consumption_for_Real-Time_Tasks","abstract":"This paper proposes a discrete time Markov decision process approach to compute the optimal on-line speed scaling policy to minimize the energy consumption of a single processor executing a finite or infinite set of jobs with real-time constraints. We provide several qualitative properties of the optimal policy: monotonicity with respect to the jobs parameters, comparison with on-line deterministic algorithms. Numerical experiments in several scenarios show that our proposition performs well when compared with off-line optimal solutions and out-performs on-line solutions oblivious to statistical information on the jobs.","authors":["Bruno Gaujal","Alain Girault","St√©phan Plassart"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Scheduling 23(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10951-020-00660-9"],"references":["324284081_Markov_Decision_Processes_Discrete_Stochastic_Dynamic_Programming","312184311_Global_Scheduling_Not_Required_Simple_Near-Optimal_Multiprocessor_Real-Time_Scheduling_with_Semi-Partitioned_Reservations","309127485_Energy_and_timing_aware_synchronous_programming","297616987_Energy_and_time_constrained_task_scheduling_on_multiprocessor_computers_with_discrete_speed_levels","285756203_Cache-related_preemption_and_migration_delays_Empirical_approximation_and_impact_on_schedulability","282688143_Energy_management_of_embedded_wireless_systems_through_voltage_and_modulation_scaling_under_probabilistic_workloads","266604188_BJORN_B_BRANDENBURG_Scheduling_and_Locking_in_Multiprocessor_Real-Time_Operating_Systems","264960784_Comparison_Methods_for_Stochastic_Models_and_Risks","248792828_Real_-_time_dynamic_voltage_scaling_for_low_powered_embedded_systems","242530063_Improving_dynamic_voltage_algorithms_with_PACE"]}
