Our aim was to identify the optimal radiomics-based machine learning method for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genotype prediction in diffuse gliomas.\n\nMethods\nEight classical machine learning methods were evaluated in terms of their stability and performance for pre-operative IDH genotype prediction. A total of 126 patients were enrolled for analysis. Overall, 704 radiomic features extracted from the pre-operative MRI images were analyzed. The patients were randomly assigned to either the training set or the validation set at a ratio of 2:1. Feature selection and classification model training were done using the training set, whereas the predictive performance and stability of the model were independently assessed using the validation set.\n\nResults\nRandom Forest (RF) showed high predictive performance (accuracy 0.885 ± 0.041, AUC 0.931 ± 0.036), whereas neural network (NN) (accuracy 0.829 ± 0.064, AUC 0.878 ± 0.052) and flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) (accuracy 0.851 ± 0.049, AUC 0.875 ± 0.057) displayed low predictive performance. With regard to stability, RF also showed high robustness against data perturbation (relative standard deviations, RSD 3.87%).\n\nConclusions\nRF is a promising machine learning method in predicting IDH genotype. Development of an accurate and reliable model can assist in the initial diagnostic evaluation and treatment planning for diffuse glioma patients.","authors":["Shuang Wu","Jin Meng","Qi Yu","Ping Li"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology 145(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00432-018-2787-1"],"references":["324089533_Diabetes_classification_model_based_on_boosting_algorithms","322907110_Radiomics_Strategy_for_Molecular_Subtype_Stratification_of_Lower-Grade_Glioma_Detecting_IDH_and_TP53_Mutations_Based_on_Multimodal_MRI_Radiomics_Molecular_Stratification_of_LrGG","320964460_Prediction_of_IDH1_-Mutation_and_1p19q-Codeletion_Status_Using_Preoperative_MR_Imaging_Phenotypes_in_Lower_Grade_Gliomas","319923725_Radiomics_signature_A_potential_biomarker_for_the_prediction_of_MGMT_promoter_methylation_in_glioblastoma_GBM_Radiomics_Features_Reflect_MGMT","319567458_Tumor_image-derived_texture_features_are_associated_with_CD3_T-cell_infiltration_status_in_glioblastoma","319493877_Advancing_The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas_glioma_MRI_collections_with_expert_segmentation_labels_and_radiomic_features","321011095_Highly_specific_determination_of_IDH_status_using_edited_in_vivo_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","320903398_CBTRUS_Statistical_Report_Primary_brain_and_other_central_nervous_system_tumors_diagnosed_in_the_United_States_in_2010-2014","320198316_Radiomics_The_bridge_between_medical_imaging_and_personalized_medicine","319207907_Pattern_Classification"]}
