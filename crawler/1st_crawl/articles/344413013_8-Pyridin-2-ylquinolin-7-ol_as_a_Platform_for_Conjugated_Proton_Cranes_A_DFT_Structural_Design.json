{"id":"344413013_8-Pyridin-2-ylquinolin-7-ol_as_a_Platform_for_Conjugated_Proton_Cranes_A_DFT_Structural_Design","abstract":"Theoretical design of conjugated proton cranes, based on 7-hydroxyquinoline as a tautomeric sub-unit, has been attempted by using ground and excited state density functional theory (DFT) calculations in various environments. The proton crane action request existence of a single enol tautomer in ground state, which under excitation goes to the excited keto tautomer through a series of consecutive excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) steps with the participation of the crane sub-unit. A series of substituted pyridines was used as crane sub-units and the corresponding donor-acceptor interactions were evaluated. The results suggest that the introduction of strong electron donor substituents in the pyridine ring creates optimal conditions for 8-(pyridin-2-yl)quinolin-7-ols to act as proton cranes.","authors":["Anton Georgiev","Liudmil Antonov"],"meta":["September 2020Micromachines 11(901)","DOI:10.3390/mi11100901"],"references":["343553583_Favipiravir_tautomerism_a_theoretical_insight","335403388_Ultrafast_Proton_Transport_between_a_Hydroxy_Acid_and_a_Nitrogen_Base_along_Solvent_Bridges_Governed_by_HydroxideMethoxide_Transfer_Mechanism","333774317_Tautomerism_in_Azo_and_Azomethyne_Dyes_When_and_If_Theory_Meets_Experiment","344272012_4-OH_coumarin_based_rotary_switches_Tautomeric_state_and_effect_of_the_stator","339791210_Chercher_de_l'eau_The_switching_mechanism_of_the_rotary_switch_ethyl-2-2-quinolin-8-ylhydrazono-2-pyridin-2-ylacetate","339163328_Optimized_effective_potentials_to_increase_the_accuracy_of_approximate_proton_transfer_energy_calculations_in_the_excited_state","329117940_DFT_study_of_hydrazone-based_molecular_switches_the_effect_of_different_stators_on_the_onoff_state_distribution","326434981_New_molecular_switch_architectures","322363092_Ultrafast_dynamics_of_the_ESIPT_photoswitch_N_-3-pyridinyl-2-pyridinecarboxamide","319681028_Dynamics_of_Excited_State_Proton_Transfer_in_Nitro_Substituted_10-Hydroxybenzohquinolines"]}
