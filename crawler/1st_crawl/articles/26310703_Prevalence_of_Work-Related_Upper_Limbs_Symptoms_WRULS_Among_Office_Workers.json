{"id":"26310703_Prevalence_of_Work-Related_Upper_Limbs_Symptoms_WRULS_Among_Office_Workers","abstract":"An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence of work-related upper limbs symptoms (WRULS) among office workers and factors associated with it. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the information. A total of 463 (87.7%) office workers from selected government agencies participated in this study. The mean age of the respondents was 34.1 years (range = 18-55 years). Majority (91.6%) were Malay and female (72.8%), and 58.1% were from clerical group. Mean duration of work was 8.7 years. This study found that prevalence of WRULS was 33.0% (95% CI [confidence interval] = 28.8%, 37.3%). Computer users at work had 2.0 (95% CI = 1.1, 3.4) higher odds ratio of developing WRULS and those who used it for 5 hours and more per day had 7.5 (95% CI = 2.3, 24.2) higher odds ratio of developing WRULS. Hand-intensive hobbies and higher education were also found to be associated with WRULS.","authors":["Zairina a Rahman","Atiya A Sallam"],"meta":["August 2009Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health 21(3):252-8","DOI:10.1177/1010539509341423","SourcePubMed"],"references":["15480015_What_do_doctors_mean_by_tenosynovitis_and_repetitive_strain_injury_Occup_Med_Lond","14282486_Recent_Trends_in_Work-Related_Cumulative_Trauma_Disorders_of_the_Upper_Extremities_in_the_United_States_An_Evaluation_of_Possible_Reasons","13647568_Occupational_upper_extremity_disorders_in_the_federal_workforce_Prevalence_health_care_expenditures_and_patterns_of_work_disability","12131850_Surveillance_of_Work-Related_Diseases_by_Occupational_Physicians_in_the_UK_OPRA_1996-1999","11765667_Use_of_keyboards_and_symptoms_in_the_neck_and_arm_evidence_from_a_national_survey","11635189_The_reported_incidence_of_work-related_musculoskeletal_disease_in_the_UK_MOSS_1997-2000","11476175_Work_environment_and_neck_and_shoulder_pain_the_influence_of_exposure_time_Results_from_a_population_based_case-control_study","10615556_Integrated_Case_Management_for_Work-Related_Upper-Extremity_Disorders_Impact_of_Patient_Satisfaction_on_Health_and_Work_Status","8959531_A_Study_on_Upper_Extremity_Cumulative_Trauma_Disorder_in_Different_Unorganised_Sectors_of_West_Bengal_India","277548487_Use_of_keyboards_and_symptoms_in_the_neck_and_arm_evidence_from_a_national_survey","273371132_Work_Related_Musculoskeletal_Disorders_WMSDs_A_Reference_Book_for_Prevention","272032818_Occupational_Upper_Extremity_Disorders_in_the_Federal_Workforce","245095575_Muscular_disorders_in_computer_users_Introduction","223788418_Factors_associated_with_self-reported_musculoskeletal_discomfort_in_video_display_terminal_VDT_users","223095788_Duration_of_computer_use_and_mouse_use_in_relation_to_musculoskeletal_disorders_of_neck_or_upper_limb","222053615_Influence_of_gender_on_work-related_musculoskeletal_disorders_in_repetitive_tasks","222027714_Musculoskeletal_symptoms_and_duration_of_computer_and_mouse_use","222027028_Motor-unit_recruitment_during_long-term_isometric_and_wrist_motion_contractions_A_study_concerning_muscular_pain_development_in_computer_operators","20246315_The_impact_of_confounder_selection_criteria_on_effect_estimation","15470590_The_influence_of_VDT_work_on_musculoskeletal_disorders","13801593_Computer_Keyboard_Force_and_Upper_Extremity_Symptoms","13637520_Cumulative_Trauma_Disorders_and_Repetitive_Strain_Injuries_The_Future","12366817_Video_Display_Terminal_Workstation_Improvement_Program_I_Baseline_Associations_Between_Musculoskeletal_Discomfort_and_Ergonomic_Features_of_Workstations"]}
