{"id":"264084635_Towards_Ultrahigh_Dimensional_Feature_Selection_for_Big_Data","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new adaptive feature scaling scheme for ultrahigh-dimensional feature selection on Big Data. To solve this problem effectively, we first reformulate it as a convex semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem, and then propose an efficient feature generating paradigm. Different from traditional gradient-based approaches that conduct optimization on all input features, the proposed method iteratively activates a group of features, and solves a sequence of multiple kernel learning (MKL) subproblems of much reduced scale. To further speed up the training, we propose to solve the MKL subproblems in their primal forms through a modified accelerated proximal gradient approach. Due to such optimization scheme, some efficient cache techniques are also developed. The feature generating paradigm is guaranteed to converge globally under mild conditions, and can achieve lower feature selection bias. Moreover, the proposed method can tackle two chal-lenging tasks in feature selection: 1) group-based feature selection with complex structures, and 2) nonlinear feature selection with explicit feature mappings. Comprehensive experi-ments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world data sets of tens of million data points with O(10 14) features demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of generalization performance and training efficiency.","authors":["Mingkui Tan","Ivor W Tsang","Li Wang"],"meta":["May 2014Journal of Machine Learning Research 15:1371-1429"],"references":["312450680_A_dual_coordinate_descent_method_for_large-scale_linear_SVM","283117671_A_Risk_Ratio_Comparison_of_l_0_and_l_1_Penalized_Regression","265986867_Greedy_Algorithms_for_Structurally_Constrained_High_Dimensional_Problems","236736746_An_Accelerated_Proximal_Gradient_Algorithm_for_Nuclear_Norm_Regularized_Least_Squares_Problems","234796609_Training_and_Testing_Low-degree_Polynomial_Data_Mappings_via_Linear_SVM","228990355_1_Convex_Optimization_with_Sparsity-Inducing_Norms","228891808_Efficient_Block-Coordinate_Descent_Algorithms_for_the_Group_Lasso","228613204_Lp-Norm_Multiple_Kernel_Learning","228058014_Pattern_Classification","226972576_Subgradient_Methods_for_Saddle-Point_Problems","226616718_On_Solving_Large-Scale_Finite_Minimax_Problems_Using_Exponential_Smoothing","223713209_Wrappers_for_Feature_Subset_Selection","221996079_An_Introduction_of_Variable_and_Feature_Selection","221664782_Generalized_Fisher_Score_for_Feature_Selection","221653970_Training_linear_SVMs_in_linear_time","221620083_Efficient_and_Accurate_Lp-Norm_Multiple_Kernel_Learning","221619995_Feature_selection_for_SVMs","221619119_An_Extended_Level_Method_for_Efficient_Multiple_Kernel_Learning","221618689_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_and_the_SMO_Algorithm","221618611_Feature_Selection_Methods_for_Improving_Protein_Structure_Prediction_with_Rosetta","321620224_Numerical_Optimization","319207907_Pattern_Classification","313659887_1-norm_support_vector_machines","313388283_Multiple_kernel_learning_conic_duality_and_the_SMO_algorithm","289860569_One_permutation_hashing","288420783_Multiple_kernel_learning_and_the_SMO_algorithm_In_Proceedings_of_NIPS","285906939_Numerical_optimization","285726241_Tree-guided_group_lasso_for_multi-task_regression_with_structured_sparsity","284689114_Classification_of_cancer_Class_discovery_and_class_prediction_by_gene_expression_monitoring","283968691_The_group_Lasso_for_logistic_regression","264312066_A_Feature_Selection_Method_for_Multivariate_Performance_Measures","262325143_On_the_Convergence_Rate_of_lp-Norm_Multiple_Kernel_Learning","260365721_On_accelerated_proximal_gradient_methods_for_convex-concave_optimization","260354092_Minimax_Sparse_Logistic_Regression_for_Very_High-Dimensional_Feature_Selection","254464345_SPF-GMKL_Generalized_multiple_kernel_learning_with_a_million_kernels","252594100_Multi-class_Feature_Selection_with_Support_Vector_Machines","246863174_Molecular_Classification_of_Cancer_Cla_ss_Discovery_and_Class_Prediction_by_Gene_Expression","236736856_Working_Set_Selection_Using_Second_Order_Information_for_Training_SVM","235357150_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent_Methods_for_Regularized_LossMinimization","230873058_The_Cutting-Plane_Method_for_Solving_Convex_Programs","229155686_Efficient_HIK_SVM_learning_for_image_classification","228624443_Cutting-set_methods_for_robust_convex_optimization_with_pessimizing_oracles","226612208_A_Feature_Selection_Newton_Method_for_Support_Vector_Machine_Classification","226608784_Convergence_of_a_Block_Coordinate_Descent_Method_for_Nondifferentiable_Minimization","224135943_Max-Margin_Additive_Classifiers_for_Detection","221996663_Variable_Selection_Using_SVM_based_Criteria","221654396_Extracting_Key-Substring-Group_Features_for_Text_Classification","221654002_Feature_selection_methods_for_text_classification","221653569_An_improved_GLMNET_for_l1-regularized_logistic_regression","221619994_Adaptive_Scaling_for_Feature_Selection_in_SVMs","221615170_Correlated_Multi-Label_Feature_Selection","221346387_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Conic_Duality_and_the_SMO_Algorithm","221346190_The_Group-Lasso_for_generalized_linear_models_Uniqueness_of_solutions_and_efficient_algorithms","221363780_Hierarchical_semantic_indexing_for_large_scale_image_retrieval","221346409_Spectral_feature_selection_for_supervised_and_unsupervised_learning"]}
