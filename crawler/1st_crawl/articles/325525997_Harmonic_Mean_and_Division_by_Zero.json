{"id":"325525997_Harmonic_Mean_and_Division_by_Zero","abstract":"We examine the harmonic mean from the view point of the division by zero and show that the harmonic mean of a and 0 is 2a or a or zero from several examples. We further show that a result on an Archimedean circle of the arbelos still holds in the singular case by using the method of the division by zero.","authors":["Hiroshi Okumura","S.
