{"id":"282200036_Experimental_and_numerical_response_of_a_high-Reynolds-number_M_06_jet_to_a_Plasma_Synthetic_Jet_actuator","abstract":"The response of a high-Reynolds-number M=. 0.6 isothermal jet to a Plasma Synthetic Jet actuator is investigated through phase-locked PIV measurements and numerical simulations. Experimentally, a single actuator located at the nozzle lip is triggered to produce a synthetic microjet, leading to the generation of a large-scale coherent structure growing into the jet mixing layer. A comparison between the measurements and the simulation is performed, showing satisfactory similarities and suggesting a suitable modeling of the interaction of the actuator with the jet mixing layer. Based on the numerical results, a detailed analysis of this interaction shows that the pressure waves created by the arc discharge in the actuator are triggering the development of the structure observed downstream, while the synthetic microjet plays a secondary role with present configuration.","authors":["Francois Chedevergne","Olivier LÃ©on","Virginel Bodoc","Daniel Caruana"],"meta":["December 2015International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow 56:1-15","DOI:10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2015.06.008"],"references":["264440013_Physics_and_models_for_plasma_synthetic_jets","264327738_On_the_use_of_Plasma_Synthetic_Jets_for_the_control_of_jet_flow_and_noise","259365944_The_'preferred_mode'_of_the_axisymmetric_jet","284572710_SHRIMP_zircon_and_monazite_U-Pb_ages_of_high-temperaturelow-pressure_metamorphism_and_granitic_magmatism_in_the_northern_Yeongnam_Massif_in_Korean","283633913_Two-Equation_Eddy-Viscosity_Turbulence_Models_for_Engineering_Applications","280158950_Transient_ejection_phase_modeling_of_a_Plasma_Synthetic_Jet_actuator","268518226_Active_Flow_Control_for_High_Speed_Jets_with_Large_Window_PIV","264498999_Plasma_synthetic_jet_actuator_Electrical_and_optical_analysis_of_the_discharge","260995138_A_study_of_linear_wavepacket_models_for_subsonic_turbulent_jets_using_local_eigenmode_decomposition_of_PIV_data","260584879_Sparkjet_Actuators_for_Flow_Control"]}
