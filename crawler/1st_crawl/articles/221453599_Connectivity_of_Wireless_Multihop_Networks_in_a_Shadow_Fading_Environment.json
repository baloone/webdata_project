{"id":"221453599_Connectivity_of_Wireless_Multihop_Networks_in_a_Shadow_Fading_Environment","abstract":"This article analyzes the connectivity of multihop radio networks in a log-normal shadow fading environment. Assuming the nodes have equal transmission capabilities and are randomly distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson process, we give a tight lower bound for the minimum node density that is necessary to obtain an almost surely connected subnetwork on a bounded area of given size. We derive an explicit expression for this bound, compute it in a variety of scenarios, and verify its tightness by simulation. The numerical results can be used for the practical design and simulation of wireless sensor and ad hoc networks. In addition, they give insight into how fading affects the topology of multihop networks. It is explained why a high fading variance helps the network to become connected.","authors":["Christian Bettstetter","Christian Hartmann"],"meta":["January 2003Wireless Networks 11(5):28-32","DOI:10.1007/s11276-005-3513-x","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Modeling Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems, MSWiM 2003, San Diego, CA, USA, September 19, 2003"],"references":["324286691_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Point_Processes","321597947_Wireless_Personal_Communications_The_Evolution_of_Personal_Communications_Systems","314831212_PATHS_analysis_of_PATH_duration_statistics_and_their_impact_on_reactive_MANET_routing_protocols","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","284677477_Critical_power_for_asymptotic_connectivity","284674055_On_the_Evolution_of_Random_Graphs","279553731_The_longest_edge_of_the_random_minimal_spanning_tree","279346984_Introduction_to_the_General_Theory_of_Point_Processes","276942208_Mobility_modeling_in_wireless_networks","266998522_Contiunuum_percolation_Reprint_of_the_1996_hardback_ed"]}
