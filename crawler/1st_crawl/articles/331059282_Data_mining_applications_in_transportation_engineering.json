{"id":"331059282_Data_mining_applications_in_transportation_engineering","abstract":"Data mining is the extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from data. In recent time, data mining studies have been carried out in many engineering disciplines. In this paper the background of data mining and tools is introduced. Further applications of data mining to transportation engineering problems are reviewed. The application of data mining for typical example of ‘Vehicle Crash Study’ is demonstrated using commercially available data mining tool. The paper highlights the potential of data mining tool application in transportation engineering sector.\n\nFirst Published Online: 19 Dec 2011","authors":["Sudhirkumar V.
