{"id":"356749598_Biomorphs_via_Jungck-CR_Iteration_with_m_h_1_h_2_-Convexity","abstract":"Fractals are important in many fields such as biology, physics, mathematics, and computer sciences. e Julia sets (JSs), Mandelbrot sets (MSs), and biomorphs are most designed fractals. is research describes biomorphs via Jungck-CR (JCR) iteration with (m, h 1 , h 2)-convexity. For this purpose, first, we establish the JCR and then define its orbit. We prove orbital radius for the generation of biomorphs via JCR. By using the derived result, we define an algorithm for biomorphs. We generate and discuss some images which resemble with biological objects.","authors":["Xiujun Zhang","M Saeed Ahmad","Mujahid Abbas","Muhammad Tanveer"],"meta":["December 2020Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 2020(10):1-9","DOI:10.1155/2020/8818346"],"references":["337026514_Fixed_Point_Results_for_Fractal_Generation_in_Extended_Jungck-SP_Orbit","331690526_Fractal_Generation_in_Modified_Jungck-S_Orbit","330379116_Mandelbrot_and_Julia_Sets_via_Jungck-CR_Iteration_with_s-Convexity","311575887_New_tricorns_and_multicorns_antifractals_in_Jungck_Mann_orbit","282163334_Fixed_point_results_in_the_generation_of_Julia_and_Mandelbrot_sets","280939316_New_Fixed_Point_Results_for_Fractal_Generation_in_Jungck_Noor_Orbit_with_s_-Convexity","276263292_Tricorns_and_Multicorns_of_S_-Iteration_Scheme","328176832_Object_distance_estimation_algorithm_for_real-time_FPGA-based_stereoscopic_vision_system","312893008_Real-time_obstacle_avoidance_for_manipulators_and_mobile_robots","275815750_A_First_Course_in_Chaotic_Dynamical_Systems_Theory_and_Experiment","259631643_An_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Utilizing_Julia_Sets_and_Hilbert_Curves","267468193_Coloring_algorithms_for_dynamical_systems_in_the_complex_plane","259994850_Julia_sets_and_Mandelbrot_sets_in_Noor_orbit","252542294_COMMENT_On_the_symmetries_of_the_Julia_sets_for_the_process_zzpc","225163684_Effect_of_Stochastic_Noise_on_Superior_Julia_Sets"]}
