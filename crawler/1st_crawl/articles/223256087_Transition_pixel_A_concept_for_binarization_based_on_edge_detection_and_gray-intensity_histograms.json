{"id":"223256087_Transition_pixel_A_concept_for_binarization_based_on_edge_detection_and_gray-intensity_histograms","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel binarization method based on the concept of transition pixel, a generalization of edge pixels. Such pixels are characterized by extreme transition values computed using pixel-intensity differences in a small neighborhood. We show how to adjust the threshold of several binary threshold methods which compute gray-intensity thresholds, using the gray-intensity mean and variance of the pixels in the transition set. Our experiments show that the new approach yields segmentation performance superior to several with current state-of-the-art binarization algorithms.","authors":["Marte Alejandro Ramirez-Ortegon","Ernesto Tapia","Leticia Ramirez","Raul Rojas"],"meta":["April 2010Pattern Recognition 43(4):1233-1243","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2009.11.006","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["224649511_Determining_Optimal_Filters_for_Binarization_of_Degraded_Characters_in_Color_Using_Genetic_Algorithms","224377985_A_Computational_Approach_To_Edge_Detection","220930404_Adaptive_Binarization_of_Historical_Document_Images","220632416_A_Survey_of_Thresholding_Techniques","220051107_Survey_over_image_thresholding_techniques_and_quantitative_performance_evaluation","215721846_Robust_Real-Time_Object_Detection","202972407_Survey_over_image_thresholding_techniques_and_quantitative_performance_evaluation","4288374_Binarization_of_Badly_Illuminated_Document_Images_through_Shading_Estimation_and_Compensation","4214780_A_binarization_algorithm_specialized_on_document_images_and_photos","3710586_Adaptive_Document_Binarization","2466682_On_the_Evaluation_of_Document_Analysis_Components_by_Recall_Precision_and_Accuracy","319770829_Robust_Real-time_Object_Detection","305437251_An_Introduction_to_Digital_Image_Processing","292692829_Wunsch_A_general_method_applicable_to_the_search_for_similarities_in_the_amino_acid_sequence_of_two_proteins","284580030_Computational_Approach_to_Edge_Pattern_Analysis_and_Machine_Intelligence_detection","248546103_An_efficient_gray-level_thresholding_algorithm_for_historic_document_images","245096644_A_survey_of_thresholding_techniques_Computer_Vision","243769649_Dynamic_thresholding_of_gray-level_images","232640443_A_Comparison_of_Binarization_Methods_for_Historical_Archive_Documents","232203667_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_From_Gray-Level_Histograms","222880315_Minimum_error_threshold","222646632_Pietikainen_M_Adaptive_Document_Image_Binarization_Pattern_Recognition_33_225-236","222044051_Binarization_and_cleanup_of_handwritten_text_from_carbon_copy_medical_form_images","220861633_A_Threshlod_Selection_Method_Based_on_Multiscale_and_Graylevel_Co-occurrence_Matrix_Analysis","220604236_A_double-threshold_image_binarization_method_based_on_edge_detector","220498762_Image_Thresholding_for_Optical_Character_Recognition_and_Other_Applications_Requiring_Character_Image_Extraction","215721564_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_From_Grey_Level_Histograms","17749606_A_General_Method_Applicable_to_Search_for_Similarities_in_Amino_Acid_Sequence_of_2_Proteins","4178611_Palmprint_identification_algorithm_using_Hu_invariant_moments_and_Otsu_binarization","3192487_Goal-Directed_Evaluation_of_Binarization_Methods"]}
