{"id":"341208725_Development_of_work_based_learning_WBL_learning_model_in_heat_transfer_courses","abstract":"Work-based learning model basically as a model approach that uses the workplace as a medium for transferring learning knowledge.During the learning period Heat Transfer students only get a descriptive description of theoretical and empirical information.Then the student learning interactions are not critical, less creative, passive communication and not there is collaboration between them. Changes in learning systems from conventional systems in class to systems that place workplace education in a laboratory of expertise.The WBL system approach method combines institutional learning patterns in the classroom with practice with laboratory-scale equipment approaches that can produce directly integrated experience between theory and real practice.The purpose of this article is to identify and review the development of work-based learning models that are applied in mechanical engineering at Bung Hatta University using will be the four C pattern namely; Critical Thinking, Creativity, Communication, and Collaboration.","authors":["Ambiyar Ambiyar","Ganefri","Suryadimal Suryadimal","Nizwardi Jalinus"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1481(1):012113","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1481/1/012113"],"references":["328456360_Model_penyelenggaraan_work-based_learning_pada_pendidikan_vokasi_Diploma_III_Otomotif","284909374_Appraising_Work-Based_Learning_Experiences_of_Technical_and_Vocational_Teacher_Educationand_Training_TVTET_Programmes_In_Nigeria","248963197_Conceptualizing_the_practitioner_doctorate","239589148_The_challenge_of_developing_the_capable_practitioner","350723866_The_Handbook_of_Work_Based_Learning","316269750_Creativity_for_21st_Century_Skills","300204076_Creativity_for_21st_Century_Skills","257926038_Work-based_Learning_A_New_Higher_Education","248979542_Work-based_Learning_Action_Learning_and_the_Virtual_Paradigm","237409871_INNOVATIVE_PRACTICES_IN_TVET_TOWARDS_EDUCATION_FOR_SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT_WORK-BASED_LEARNING_DIPLOMA_PROGRAMMES_AT_COMMUNITY_COLLEGES_IN_MALAYSIA"]}
