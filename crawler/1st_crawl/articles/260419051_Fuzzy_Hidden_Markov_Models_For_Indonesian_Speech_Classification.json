{"id":"260419051_Fuzzy_Hidden_Markov_Models_For_Indonesian_Speech_Classification","abstract":"Indonesia has many tribes, so that there are many dialects. Speech classification is difficult if the database uses speech signals from various who have different characteristics because of gender and dialect. The different characteristics will influence frequency, intonation, amplitude, and period of the speech. It makes the system must be trained for the various templates reference of speech signal. Therefore, this study has been developed for Indonesian speech classification. The solution is a new combination of fuzzy on hidden Markov models. The result shows a new version of fuzzy hidden Markov models is better than hidden Markov model.","authors":["Intan Nurma","Houw Liong Thee","Kang Adiwijaya"],"meta":["November 2012Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics 16(3):381-387","Project: Total Electron Content (TEC) & Ionosphere Model"],"references":["239315629_Voice_Recognition_with_Neural_Networks_Type2_Fuzzy_Logic_and_Genetic_Algorithms","222814195_A_biomedical_system_based_on_fuzzy_discrete_hidden_Markov_model_for_the_diagnosis_of_the_brain_diseases","4113483_Interval_type-2_fuzzy_hidden_Markov_models"]}
