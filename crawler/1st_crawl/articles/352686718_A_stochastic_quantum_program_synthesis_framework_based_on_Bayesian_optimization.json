{"id":"352686718_A_stochastic_quantum_program_synthesis_framework_based_on_Bayesian_optimization","abstract":"Quantum computers and algorithms can offer exponential performance improvement over some NP-complete programs which cannot be run efficiently through a Von Neumann computing approach. In this paper, we present BayeSyn, which utilizes an enhanced stochastic program synthesis and Bayesian optimization to automatically generate quantum programs from high-level languages subject to certain constraints. We find that stochastic synthesis can comparatively and efficiently generate a program with a lower cost from the high dimensional program space. We also realize that hyperparameters used in stochastic synthesis play a significant role in determining the optimal program. Therefore, BayeSyn utilizes Bayesian optimization to fine-tune such parameters to generate a suitable quantum program.","authors":["Yao Xiao","Shahin Nazarian","Paul Bogdan"],"meta":["June 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-91035-3"],"references":["336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","335976299_Quantum_Computer_Architecture_Towards_Full-Stack_Quantum_Accelerators","332812335_Quantum_Accelerated_Computer_Architectures","322243414_Quantum_Computing_in_the_NISQ_era_and_beyond","311925589_ProjectQ_An_Open_Source_Software_Framework_for_Quantum_Computing","348671594_Quantum_Computer_Architecture_Toward_Full-Stack_Quantum_Accelerators","330069440_Nonsilicon_Non-von_Neumann_Computing-Part_I","323503314_Q_Enabling_Scalable_Quantum_Computing_and_Development_with_a_High-level_DSL","309738110_Learning_to_superoptimize_programs","301880546_A_Software_Methodology_for_Compiling_Quantum_Programs"]}
