{"id":"305403401_Approximate_Computing_in_MOSSpintronic_Non-Volatile_Full-Adder","abstract":"Approximate computing and its related topics have shown the potential in next generation computing systems. In this paper, new circuit level design for approximate computing is proposed based on non-volatile (NV) logic-in-memory structure. Two types of NV approximate adders are implemented with circuit reconfiguration and insufficient writing current. Spin torque transfer magnetic tunnel junction (STT-MTJ) is used as NV memory element in magnetic full adder (MFA). The proposed approximate MFAs are implemented with 28nm ultra thin body and buried oxide (UTBB) fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) technology. Simulation results are presented including power consumption, circuit latency, leakage power, error distance and reliability performance. Low V dd design strategies are discussed as well.","authors":["Hao Cai","You Wang","Lirida Naviner","Zhaohao Wang"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2950067.2950101","Conference: 12th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (Nanoarch 2016)At: Beijing, China","Project: Spintronics and FDSOI"],"references":["279160386_Multiplexing_Sense-Amplifier-Based_Magnetic_Flip-Flop_in_a_28-nm_FDSOI_Technology","260095207_Ultra_Low_Power_Magnetic_Flip-Flop_Based_on_CheckpointingPower_Gating_and_Self-Enable_Mechanisms","224235660_A_High-Reliability_Low-Power_Magnetic_Full_Adder","3451532_A_Novel_High-Speed_and_Energy_Efficient_10-Transistor_Full_Adder_Design","308851459_Dynamic_single-p-well_SRAM_bitcell_characterization_with_back-bias_adjustment_for_optimized_wide-voltage-range_SRAM_operation_in_28nm_UTBB_FD-SOI","308848584_Single-well_design_in_FDSOI_technology_Towards_energy-efficient_ultra-wide_voltage_range_digital_circuits","298724523_Low_Power_Magnetic_Flip-flop_Optimization_with_FDSOI_Technology_Boost","297676614_Compact_Model_of_Dielectric_Breakdown_in_Spin-Transfer_Torque_Magnetic_Tunnel_Junction","285510366_Spintronics-based_Computing","279311645_Synchronous_8-bit_Non-Volatile_Full-Adder_based_on_Spin_Transfer_Torque_Magnetic_Tunnel_Junction","279177195_Approximate_Storage_for_Energy_Efficient_Spintronic_Memories","276073747_Towards_Power_Optimization_and_Implementation_of_Probabilistic_Circuits_Using_Single-Electron_Technology","273485742_A_Low_Power_and_High_Sensing_Margin_Non-Volatile_Full_Adder_Using_Racetrack_Memory","273393839_Nonvolatile_Logic-in-Memory_LSI_Using_Cycle-Based_Power_Gating_and_its_Application_to_Motion-Vector_Prediction","271465754_Circuit_design_in_nanoscale_FDSOI_technologies","269328480_Approximate_XORXNOR-based_adders_for_inexact_computing","268688570_Compact_model_of_magnetic_tunnel_junction_with_stochastic_spin_transfer_torque_switching_for_reliability_analyses","263319693_Scalable_035_v_to_12_v_SRAM_bitcell_design_from_65_nm_CMOS_to_28_nm_FDSOI","261378723_Approximate_computing_An_emerging_paradigm_for_energy-efficient_design","261307365_Stochastic_computation","260585402_New_Metrics_for_the_Reliability_of_Approximate_and_Probabilistic_Adders","260330247_Low_Power_Magnetic_Full-Adder_Based_on_Spin_Transfer_Torque_MRAM","256815594_Failure_and_reliability_analysis_of_STT-MRAM","247925150_What_is_stochastic_computation","234867203_Tunnel_Magnetoresistance_of_604_at_300_K_by_Suppression_of_Ta_Diffusion_in_CoFeBMgOCoFeB_Pseudo-Spin-Valves_Annealed_at_High_Temperature","227521040_New_non-volatile_Logic_based_on_Spin-MTJ","224567478_Nonvolatile_Magnetic_Flip-Flop_for_Standby-Power-Free_SoCs","222455991_Tunneling_Between_Ferromagnetic_Films","221340053_MTJ-based_nonvolatile_logic-in-memory_circuit_future_prospects_and_issues"]}
