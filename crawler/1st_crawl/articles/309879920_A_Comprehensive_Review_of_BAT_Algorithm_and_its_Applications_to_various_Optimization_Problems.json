{"id":"309879920_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_BAT_Algorithm_and_its_Applications_to_various_Optimization_Problems","abstract":"Bio-inspired algorithms are emerging very rapidly and are applied to different kinds of problems. The recently developed Bat algorithm is one of its kinds which is gaining popularity because of its simplicity and efficiency. The algorithm imitates the behavior of bats and serves as a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of different applications of bat algorithm.","authors":["N. Mohan","R. Sivaraj","R.
