{"id":"329261402_Supercomputing_A_scientometric_assessment_of_global_publications_output_during_2007-16","abstract":"The paper examines global publications output (8647) on supercomputing research on various publication and citation indicators with a view to map status of supercomputing research covering publications as indexed in Scopus database during 10 – year period 2007 – 16. Supercomputing research registered 8.45% growth per annum and averaged 6.62 citations per paper during the period. 98.23% of global supercomputing research has been contributed by just 12 countries, with USA accounting for the highest 40% share. The UK tops in relative citation index in this field with its citation performance rated well above the world average of 1.32. International collaboration has been as one of the major drivers of supercomputing research as 21.88% to 69.95% of output by top 12 countries appeared as international collaborative publications. Computer Science has come up as the most popular sub – fields in supercomputing research with 71.63% highest publications share. The study further identifies top 15 most productive organizations and authors, top 49 papers with 100+ citations, and top 16 journals in supercomputing research. The study concludes that ongoing government funding and support is critical to catalyze growth and expansion of applications, capacities, and capabilities in supercomputing research and also to improve and expand its performance in quantitative and qualitative terms.","authors":["Surinder M Dhawan","Brij Mohan Gupta","Ritu Gupta"],"meta":["July 2018Collnet Journal of Scientometrics and Information Management 12(2):197-213","DOI:10.1080/09737766.2018.1545395"],"references":["320191882_Highly_Cited_Publications_Output_by_India_in_Computer_Science_1996-15_A_Scientometric_Assessment","311107473_GRID_COMPUTING_RESEARCH_IN_GLOBAL_PUBLICATIONS_A_SCIENTOMETRIC_STUDY","303318727_Global_Research_on_Artificial_Intelligence_from_1990-2014_Spatially-Explicit_Bibliometric_Analysis","283558352_International_cloud_computing_literature_A_scientometric_analysis_for_2004-13","282772901_Indian_Cloud_Computing_Research_A_Scientometric_Assessment_of_Publications_Output_During_2004-13","282524329_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_the_Turkish_software_engineering_research_community","267966386_Indian_Computer_Science_Research_Output_during_1999-2008_Qualitative_Analysis","346405474_Bibliometrics_of_computer_science_literature_in_Nigeria","283202475_Scientometric_mapping_of_computer_science_research_in_Mexico","271995403_Mapping_the_Computer_Science_Research_in_SAARC_Countries"]}
