{"id":"332095819_The_Macroeconomist_as_Scientist_and_Engineer","abstract":"The article written by a prominent American expert analyzes the development of macroeconomic ideas. The author considers the history of macroeconomics as an interaction between applied (\"engineer\") and theoretical traditions. Although modern theoretical approaches, as he argues, didnt have a serious impact on economic policy, their emergence helped creating rigorous analytical tools used to develop a new generation of models (\"New Neoclassical Synthesis\"). The latter are to form the basis of new macroeconometric approaches and new macroeconomic engineering.","authors":["N. G.
