{"id":"234168703_Graphene_plasmonics","abstract":"Two rich and vibrant fields of investigation, graphene physics and\nplasmonics, strongly overlap. Not only does graphene possess intrinsic plasmons\nthat are tunable and adjustable, but a combination of graphene with noble-metal\nnanostructures promises a variety of exciting applications for conventional\nplasmonics. The versatility of graphene means that graphene-based plasmonics\nmay enable the manufacture of novel optical devices working in different\nfrequency ranges, from terahertz to the visible, with extremely high speed, low\ndriving voltage, low power consumption and compact sizes. Here we review the\nfield emerging at the intersection of graphene physics and plasmonics.","authors":["A.N. Grigorenko","Marco Polini","K.S.
