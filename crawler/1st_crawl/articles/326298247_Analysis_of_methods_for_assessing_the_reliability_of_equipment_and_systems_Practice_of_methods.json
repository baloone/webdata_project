{"id":"326298247_Analysis_of_methods_for_assessing_the_reliability_of_equipment_and_systems_Practice_of_methods","abstract":"The analysis of models and methods of reliability evaluation of hardware and software is carried out. The basic concepts of reliability and safety methods of such systems and situations leading to errors, defects and failures are defined. The definition of reliability and safety of technical systems and software systems is given. The classification of reliability models: predictive, measuring and evaluation types. Evaluation models that are used more in practice are described. The standard of Software life cycle (ISO 15288:2002) is defined, focused on the development and control of system components for errors, starting with the system requirements. The results of application of reliability models (Moussa, Goel-Okomoto, etc.) to small, medium and large projects are presented and their comparative assessment is given. The technological module (TM) of reliability evaluation of complex software systems VPK (1989) is described. The quality model of the standard ISO 9126 (1-4): 2002-2004 with indicators of functionality, reliability, efficiency, etc., which are used in determining the maturity and certificate of the product is shown.","authors":["E.M.
