{"id":"281665704_Skin_A_Natural_History","abstract":"We expose it, cover it, paint it, tattoo it, scar it, and pierce it. Our intimate connection with the world, skin protects us while advertising our health, our identity, and our individuality. This dazzling synthetic overview is a complete guidebook to the pliable covering that makes us who we are. Skin: A Natural History celebrates the evolution of three unique attributes of human skin: its naked sweatiness, its distinctive sepia rainbow of colors, and its remarkable range of decorations. Jablonski places the rich cultural canvas of skin within its broader biological context for the first time, and the result is a tremendously engaging look at us.","authors":["Nina G Jablonski"],"meta":["February 2013"],"references":["252551293_The_First_85_million_years_of_Avian_Evolution","246403104_Hydrodynamics_and_compliant_walls_Does_the_dolphin_have_a_secret","222906678_Autonomic_nervous_system_response_patterns_specifity_to_basic_emotions","215638133_See_red_Turn_pale_Unveiling_Emotions_through_Cardiovascular_and_Hemodynamic_Changes","51222479_Fruits_Fingers_and_Fermentation_The_Sensory_Cues_Available_to_Foraging_Primates","41433065_Genetic_Variation_at_the_MC1R_Locus_and_the_Time_since_Loss_of_Human_Body_Hair","24446708_From_the_Cover_Mitochondrial_DNA_sequences_in_ancient_Australians_Implications_for_modern_human_origins","22703301_Natural_selective_cooling_of_the_human_brain_evidence_of_its_occurrence_and_magnitude","22297926_Thermoregulatory_responses_as_a_function_of_core_temperature_in_humans","21654005_Cardiovascular_differentiation_of_emotions","21376442_The_evolution_of_sweat_glands","20097601_Human_Skin_Color_A_Possible_Relationship_Between_Its_Sexual_Dimorphism_and_Its_Social_Perception","285092045_The_development_of_affectional_responses_in_infant_monkeys","284108129_Maternal_behavior_of_rhesus_monkeys_deprived_of_mothering_and_peer_associations_in_infancy","281027432_Stand_tall_and_stay_cool","280020364_Brain_evolution_in_Homo_The_radiator_theory","279564474_Clinical_potential_of_autologous_epithelial_suspension","270329645_101_Some_Ibo_Attitudes_to_Skin_Pigmentation","249138562_Structural_Reduction_in_Evolution","249138192_The_Biological_Adaptation_of_Man_to_Hot_Deserts","247820058_Increased_Folate_Catabolism_Following_Total_Body_GAMMAIrradiation_in_Mice","247204821_A_critical_role_for_B-vitamin_nutrition_in_human_developmental_and_evolutionary_biology","237959875_Some_Ecological_Factors_Bearing_on_the_Origin_and_Evolution_of_Pigment_in_the_Human_Skin","233821332_Was_man_more_aquatic_in_the_past","233439550_Origin_of_habitual_terrestrial_bipedalism_in_the_ancestor_of_Hominidae","232754628_Making_make-up_in_Ancient_Egypt","227913909_The_use_of_touch_to_enhance_nursing_care_of_older_person_in_long-term_mental_health_care_facilities","227550616_Murray_FGPigmentation_sunlight_and_nutritional_disease_Am_Anthropol_36438-445","227007073_Life_history_of_yellow_baboons_Physical_development_reproductive_parameters_and_infant_mortality","226251552_Response_of_human_skin_to_the_savanna","223216937_The_thermoregulatory_advantages_of_hominid_bipedalism_in_open_equatorial_environments_The_contribution_of_increased_convective_heat_loss_and_cutaneous_evaporative_cooling","223150154_The_loss_of_functional_body_hair_in_man_The_influence_of_thermal_environment_body_form_and_bipedality","223083720_Physiology_thermoregulation_and_bipedalism","222759255_The_influence_of_bipedalism_on_the_energy_and_water_budgets_of_early_hominids","222734138_Chapter_18_UV-induced_pigmentation_in_human_skin","222234435_The_evolution_of_bipedality_and_loss_of_functional_body_hair_in_hominids","222225133_A_sensitive_skin_system_for_motion_control_of_robot_arm_manipulators","41501058_Modern_Primitivism'_Non-Mainstream_Body_Modification_and_Racialized_Representation","31503561_Cross-Testing_Adaptive_Hypotheses_Phylogenetic_Analysis_and_the_Origin_of_Bird_Flight","22550853_The_Effect_of_Aminopterin-Induced_Folic_Acid_Deficiency_on_Spermatogenesis","22467555_Skin_Color_and_Nutrient_Photolysis_An_Evolutionary_Hypothesis","22332662_A_10-year_perspective_of_motherless-mother_monkey_behavior","21890845_Average_latitudinal_variation_in_ultraviolet_radiation_at_the_Earth's_surface","21716356_Social_blushing","21083972_Pheomelanin_as_well_as_Eumelanin_Is_Present_in_Human_Epidermis","21056386_Facial_coloration_and_temperature_responses_in_blushing","20850993_Pyrimethamine_An_approach_to_the_development_of_a_male_contraceptive","20431611_Dietary_folate_as_a_risk_factor_for_neural-tube_defects_Evidence_from_a_case-control_study_in_Western_Australia","20105974_Why_is_flushing_limited_to_a_mostly_facial_cutaneous_distribution","19985122_Consequences_of_skin_color_and_fur_properties_for_solar_heat_gain_and_UV_irradiance_in_two_mammals","19758915_Precedence_of_head_homoeothermia_over_trunk_homoeothermia_in_dehydrated_men","19580763_Facial_flushing_and_sweating_mediated_by_the_sympathetic_nervous_system","19218872_Vitamin-D-deficient_rickets_in_Manitoba_1972-84","19041901_Vitamin-D_deficiency_in_Asians_at_home_and_in_Britain","18880659_Human_Pigmentation_and_Environmental_Adaptation"]}
