{"id":"268426798_An_Energy_Sorting_Protocol_ESP_With_Low_Energy_and_Low_Latency_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Data gathering is a critical operation in wireless sensor network applications, which necessitates energy efficiency techniques for increasing the lifetime of the network. Clustering is a similar effective technique that improves the energy efficiency and network lifetime in wireless sensor networks. This paper proposes an Energy Sorting Protocol (ESP) architecture in which clustering is used. The objective of ESP architecture in case of wireless micro-sensor networks is to accomplish low energy dissipation and latency without sacrificing application specific quality. In order to attain the objective, ESP employs (i) randomized, adaptive, self -configuring cluster formation (ii) localized control for data transfers and (iii) application -specific data processing, such as data aggregation or compression. In order to generate good clusters as the outcome, each node is permitted to make autonomous decisions by the cluster formation algorithm. Simulation results illustrate that, this algorithm also minimizes the energy and latency for cluster formation, in order to minimize overhead to the protocol.","authors":["A Allirani","M Suganthi"],"meta":[],"references":["229049924_Energy-efficient_cluster_formation_for_large_sensor_networks_using_a_minimum_separation_distance","221932967_Instrumenting_The_World_With_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220926111_Next_Century_Challenges_Scalable_Coordination_in_Sensor_Networks","3432618_An_Application-Specific_Protocol_Architecture_for_Wireless_Micro-Sensor_Networks","264679082_Sensor_Networks_An_Overview","232640876_Energy-scalable_algorithms_and_protocols_for_wireless_microsensor_networks","228394477_Energy-Efficient_Communication_Protocol_for_Wireless_Microsensor_Networks","224760552_Energy-Efficient_Clustering_System_Model_and_Reconfiguration_Schemes_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224071752_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","34769747_Application-specific_protocol_architecture_for_wireless_networks","4153506_EECS_An_energy_efficient_clustering_scheme_in_wireless_sensor_networks_10a2","3975757_Low_Energy_Adaptive_Clustering_Hierarchy_with_Deterministic_Cluster-Head_Selection","3968599_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems","3227649_Sensor_Networks_an_Overview","2936392_HEED_A_Hybrid_Energy-Efficient_Distributed_Clustering_Approach_for_Ad-hoc_Sensor_Networks"]}
