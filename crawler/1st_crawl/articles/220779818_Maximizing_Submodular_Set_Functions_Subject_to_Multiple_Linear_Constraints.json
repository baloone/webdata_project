{"id":"220779818_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions_Subject_to_Multiple_Linear_Constraints","abstract":"The concept of submodularity plays a vital role in com- binatorial optimization. In particular, many impor- tant optimization problems can be cast as submodu- lar maximization problems, including maximum cov- erage, maximum facility location and max cut in di- rected/undirected graphs. In this paper we present the flrst known approxima- tion algorithms for the problem of maximizing a non- decreasing submodular set function subject to multiple linear constraints. Given a d-dimensional budget vector \" L, for some d ‚ 1, and an oracle for a non-decreasing submodular set function f over a universe U, where each element e 2 U is associated with a d-dimensional cost vector, we seek a subset of elements S µ U whose total cost is at most \"","authors":["Ariel Kulik","Hadas Shachnai","Tami Tamir"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1145/1496770.1496830","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, SODA 2009, New York, NY, USA, January 4-6, 2009"],"references":["242914003_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions-I","304425177_Pipage_Rounding_A_New_Method_of_Constructing_Algorithms_with_Proven_Performance_Guarantee","297386177_Approximation_algorithms_for_submodular_set_cover_with_applications","281800632_Algorithms_for_Knapsack_Problems","278690128_Knapsack_Problems","239667817_Approximation_algorithms_for_m-dimensional_0-1_knapsack_problem_Worst_case_and_probabilistic_analysis","227273737_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Class-Constrained_Packing_Problems","226716255_On_Two_Class-Constrained_Versions_of_the_Multiple_Knapsack_Problem","226715030_Pipage_Rounding_A_New_Method_of_Constructing_Algorithms_with_Proven_Performance_Guarantee","225246148_An_analysis_of_approximations_for_maximizing_submodular_set_functions-II","221437534_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Budget-Constrained_Auctions","221591306_Optimal_approximation_for_the_Submodular_Welfare_Problem_in_the_value_oracle_model","221590427_Non-monotone_submodular_maximization_under_matroid_and_knapsack_constraints","221462795_Maximum_Coverage_Problem_with_Group_Budget_Constraints_and_Applications","221317013_Maximizing_a_Submodular_Set_Function_Subject_to_a_Matroid_Constraint_Extended_Abstract"]}
