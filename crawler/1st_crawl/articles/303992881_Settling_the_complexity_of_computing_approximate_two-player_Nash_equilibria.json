{"id":"303992881_Settling_the_complexity_of_computing_approximate_two-player_Nash_equilibria","abstract":"We prove that there exists a constant $\\epsilon>0$ such that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis for PPAD, computing an $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium in a two-player (nXn) game requires quasi-polynomial time, $n^{\\log^{1-o(1)} n}$. This matches (up to the o(1) term) the algorithm of Lipton, Markakis, and Mehta [LMM03]. Our proof relies on a variety of techniques from the study of probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP); this is the first time that such ideas are used for a reduction between problems inside PPAD. En route, we also prove new hardness results for computing Nash equilibria in games with many players. In particular, we show that computing an $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium in a game with n players requires $2^{\\Omega(n)}$ oracle queries to the payoff tensors. This resolves an open problem posed by Hart and Nisan [HN13], Babichenko [Bab14], and Chen et al. [CCT15]. In fact, our results for n-player games are stronger: they hold with respect to the $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-WeakNash relaxation recently introduced by Babichenko et al. [BPR16].","authors":["Aviad Rubinstein"],"meta":["June 2016ACM SIGecom Exchanges 15(2)","DOI:10.1145/3055589.3055596"],"references":["311491322_Nondeterministic_Extensions_of_the_Strong_Exponential_Time_Hypothesis_and_Consequences_for_Non-reducibility","310594965_Almost-Polynomial_Ratio_ETH-Hardness_of_Approximating_Densest_k-Subgraph","283532081_Well-Supported_versus_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_Query_Complexity_of_Large_Games","275055169_Large_Supports_are_required_for_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria","266658384_Bounds_for_the_query_complexity_of_approximate_equilibria","259915238_AM_with_Multiple_Merlins","257142896_Polylogarithmic_Supports_Are_Required_for_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_below_23","234802885_Robust_PCPs_of_proximity_Shorter_PCPs_and_Applications_to_Coding","319197315_Computing_Constrained_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Polymatrix_Games","312079573_ETH_Hardness_for_Densest-_k_-Subgraph_with_Perfect_Completeness","311569113_Inapproximability_Results_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","311490964_Can_Almost_Everybody_be_Almost_Happy","310953157_Detecting_communities_is_hard_and_counting_them_is_even_harder","309663532_The_approximation_of_fixed_points_of_a_continuous_mappings_SIAM","309019750_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","306398167_Communication_complexity_of_approximate_Nash_equilibria","305524959_Hardness_Results_for_Signaling_in_Bayesian_Zero-Sum_and_Network_Routing_Games","302887909_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","301875681_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_in_Tree_Polymatrix_Games","292215841_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_and_Dense_Bipartite_Subgraphs_via_an_Approximate_Version_of_Caratheodory's_Theorem","291933504_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_in_Tree_Polymatrix_Games","290453010_Known_Algorithms_for_Edge_Clique_Cover_are_Probably_Optimal","287251359_Near-Optimal_Hardness_Results_for_Signaling_in_Bayesian_Games","283692407_A_combination_of_testability_and_decodability_by_tensor_products","282997327_ETH-Hardness_for_Signaling_in_Symmetric_Zero-Sum_Games","282719809_Approximating_the_best_Nash_Equilibrium_in_no_1ogn-time_breaks_the_exponential_time_hypothesis","275669212_ETH_Hardness_for_Densest-k-Subgraph_with_Perfect_Completeness","268072213_Lower_bounds_based_on_the_exponential_time_hypothesis","265644374_Computing_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_in_Polymatrix_Games","265454880_Equilibrium_Points_of_Bi-Matrix_Games","262338415_Inapproximability_of_Nash_Equilibrium","262240280_The_approximate_rank_of_a_matrix_and_its_algorithmic_applications","262071856_Computational_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibrium_in_Large_Games","260213134_Approximate_Nash_equilibria_in_anonymous_games","243458309_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","242688803_An_Iterative_Method_of_Solving_a_Game","242608512_Introduction_to_Parallel_Algorithms_and_Architectures_Arrays_Trees_Hypercubes","237092124_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibrium","236871805_The_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibria","232633216_Simple_construction_of_almost_k-wise_independent_random_variables","228057642_Probabilistic_checking_of_proofs_A_new_characterization_of_NP","226347977_Polynomial_Algorithms_for_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games","223354618_Exponential_Lower_Bounds_for_Finding_Brouwer_Fixed_Points","223058592_On_the_Complexity_of_the_Parity_Argument_and_Other_Inefficient_Proofs_of_Existence","222871046_On_sparse_approximations_to_randomized_strategies_and_convex_combinations","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222521916_On_the_complexity_of_k-SAT","222504563_The_Relative_Complexity_of_NP_Search_Problems","222415790_Tolerant_property_testing_and_distance_approximation","222069855_A_note_on_approximate_Nash_equilibria","221591854_Checking_Computations_in_Polylogarithmic_Time","221591740_The_complexity_of_computing_a_Nash_equilibrium","221590125_Nearly-linear_size_holographic_proofs","221590899_Robust_PCPs_of_proximity_shorter_PCPs_and_applications_to_coding","221444972_Approximating_Nash_equilibria_using_small-support_strategies"]}
