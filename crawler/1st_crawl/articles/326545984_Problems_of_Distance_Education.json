{"id":"326545984_Problems_of_Distance_Education","abstract":"Distance learning and e-learning have significantly developed in recent years. It is also due to changing educational requirements, especially for adults. The article aims to show the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning. Examples of the 20-year use of the distance learning form of computer science describe the difficulties associated with the implementation and implementation of this form of teaching. The results of students in the full-time and distance form of teaching in the bachelor’s study of computer science are compared. Long-term findings show that distant students have significantly lower scores in the first years of study than full-time bachelor students. In the following years of study, the differences diminish, and students’ results are comparable. The article describes the possibilities of improving the quality of distance learning.","authors":["Rostislav Fojtik"],"meta":["May 2018International Journal of Information and Communication Technologies in Education 7(1):14-23","DOI:10.2478/ijicte-2018-0002"],"references":["277902293_Integrating_Blended_Learning_in_Higher_Education","277902292_Teaching_and_Learning_Enhanced_by_Information_and_Communication_Technologies","26468338_Differences_Between_Traditional_and_Distance_Education_Academic_Performances_A_Meta-Analytic_Approach","283917530_Perceptions_of_distance_learning_A_comparison_of_online_and_traditional_learning","254664164_The_effects_of_distance_education_on_K-12_student_outcomes_a_meta-analysis","251645858_Online_or_face-to-face_Students'_experiences_and_preferences_in_e-learning","228875226_The_effects_of_distance_education_on_K-12_student_outcomes_A_meta-analysis","222537098_Comparing_dropouts_and_persistence_in_e-Learning_courses","222239759_Distance_students_and_online_research_Promoting_information_literacy_through_media_literacy","40342210_Metody_pedagogickeho_vyzkumu_zaklady_kvantitativniho_vyzkumu"]}
