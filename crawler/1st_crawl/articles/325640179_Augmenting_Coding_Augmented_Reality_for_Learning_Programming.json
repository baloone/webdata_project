{"id":"325640179_Augmenting_Coding_Augmented_Reality_for_Learning_Programming","abstract":"Augmented reality (AR) is breaking into every industry and is finding a home in many unique and novel applications, due in part to its ability to engage users and their physical surroundings in potentially immersive means. We present our early investigation into whether these qualities of AR may be leveraged to help people learn coding more easily and with more fun. Using a within-subjects design with 12 participants, our pilot study evaluated two interactive AR coding environments: (1) head-mounted AR with Microsoft HoloLens, (2) mobile AR with ARKit on an iPhone; together with a conventional 2D touch interface using Swift Playground on an iPad as baseline. Participants enjoyed using mobile AR the most, and they also completed programming tasks the fastest when using it. Our current results suggest AR may have potential in enhancing beginners' learning experience for coding, especially for tasks that are more interactive and benefit from visual feedback.","authors":["Nathan Dass","Joonyoung Kim","Sam Ford","Sudeep Agarwal"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1145/3202667.3202695","Conference: the Sixth International Symposium of Chinese CHI"],"references":["318761785_The_Hologram_in_My_Hand_How_Effective_is_Interactive_Exploration_of_3D_Visualizations_in_Immersive_Tangible_Augmented_Reality","309722798_Advantages_and_challenges_associated_with_augmented_reality_for_education_A_systematic_review_of_the_literature","288873928_Augmented_reality_in_science_laboratories_The_effects_of_augmented_reality_on_university_students'_laboratory_skills_and_attitudes_toward_science_laboratories"]}
