{"id":"338817131_ESCAPE-SG_Un_simulateur_d'evacuation_massive_de_population_pour_la_formation_des_acteurs_a_la_gestion_de_crise","abstract":"Escape-SG is a simulator project inspired by serious games. It will immerse the trainees in realistic situations of potentially major crises requiring the evacuation of populations. Developed for and with crisis management actors, these scenarios will aim to assess their knowledge of procedures, improve their interaction and communication skills within crisis cells and prepare them to manage major events that may involve massive population displacement. Developed to operate on a touch table, this simulator will be integrated into crisis management simulation rooms where it will make an important contribution considering complex social dynamics in the scenarios proposed.","authors":["Daud√© Eric","Pierrick Tranouez"],"meta":["January 2020Netcom","DOI:10.4000/netcom.5637"],"references":["311650417_Crowdsourcing_and_Crowdtasking_in_Crisis_Management_Lessons_Learned_From_a_Field_Experiment_Simulating_a_Flooding_in_City_of_the_Hague","280081066_Fire_simulation-based_adaptation_of_SmartRescue_App_for_serious_game_Design_setup_and_user_experience","277930405_Recent_Advances_in_Agent-Based_Tsunami_Evacuation_Simulations_Case_Studies_in_Indonesia_Thailand_Japan_and_Peru","271155251_Video_games_and_urban_simulation_New_tools_or_new_tricks","266614055_TOXI-CITY_An_agentbased_model_for_exploring_the_effects_of_risk_awareness_and_spatial_configuration_on_the_survival_rate_in_the_case_of_industrial_accidents","266398023_Gamification_in_Theory_and_Action_A_Survey","319770006_Learning_Deep_Features_for_Discriminative_Localization","316072583_La_gestion_de_crise_a_l'epreuve_de_l'exercice_EU_SEQUANA","311314328_Using_games_for_teaching_crisis_communication_in_higher_education_and_training","271938975_Does_playing_the_serious_game_B-SaFe_Make_citizens_more_aware_of_man-made_and_natural_risks_in_their_environment"]}
