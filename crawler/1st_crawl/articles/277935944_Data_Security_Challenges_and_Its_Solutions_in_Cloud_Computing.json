{"id":"277935944_Data_Security_Challenges_and_Its_Solutions_in_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"Cloud Computing trend is rapidly increasing that has an technology connection with Grid Computing, Utility Computing, Distributed Computing. Cloud service providers such as Amazon IBM, Google's Application, Microsoft Azure etc., provide the users in developing applications in cloud environment and to access them from anywhere. Cloud data are stored and accessed in a remote server with the help of services provided by cloud service providers. Providing security is a major concern as the data is transmitted to the remote server over a channel (internet). Before implementing Cloud Computing in an organization, security challenges needs to be addressed first. In this paper, we highlight data related security challenges in cloud based environment and solutions to overcome.","authors":["R. Velumadhava Rao","K.
