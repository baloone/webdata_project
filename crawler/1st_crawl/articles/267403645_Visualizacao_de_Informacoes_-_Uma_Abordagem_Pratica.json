{"id":"267403645_Visualizacao_de_Informacoes_-_Uma_Abordagem_Pratica","abstract":"Information Visualization is an emerging scientific area that studies ways of presenting data visually, so that information about the data can be better understood or even dis-covered. This course discusses several aspects regarding the visual presentation of data and introduces well known and effective techniques for information visualization. The te-chniques presented here have applications in many scientific fields. In Computer Science, particularly, they gain special attention for data mining and software engineering (for the development of CAD and CASE software). The present paper differs from other ma-terials because it not only gives conceptual details of the Information Visualization area, but also discusses algorithms and proposes guidelines for implementing new visualization techniques.","authors":["Hugo A.
