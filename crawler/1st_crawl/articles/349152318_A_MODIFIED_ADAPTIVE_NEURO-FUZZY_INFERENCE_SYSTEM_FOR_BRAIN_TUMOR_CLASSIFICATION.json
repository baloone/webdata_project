{"id":"349152318_A_MODIFIED_ADAPTIVE_NEURO-FUZZY_INFERENCE_SYSTEM_FOR_BRAIN_TUMOR_CLASSIFICATION","abstract":"In recent years, researchers from both medical and computer sciences have combined their knowledge and efforts to\ndiagnose brain tumor diseases using intelligent algorithms. However, existing brain tumor classification techniques produce high\nlevels of misclassification which in turn cause inaccurate diagnosis of brain tumor. In this paper, we classified brain tumor into\nmeningioma, glioma and pituitary tumor with different shapes, sizes and locations using a Modified Adaptive Neuro- Fuzzy\nInference System (M-ANFIS) where self-organizing maps are used to carry out dimensionality reduction.\nResults obtained showed that M-ANFIS classifier has accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision and F-score of 99, 98,\n99, 96 and 98%, respectively while the traditional ANFIS classifier gave accuracy of 95%, specificity of 96%, sensitivity of 92%,\nprecision of 92% and F-score of 92 %, respectively.","authors":["F.A Ajala","Folowosele A.O","Shuab O.M","Jeremiah Y.S"],"meta":["December 2020","DOI:10.26821/IJSHRE.8.12.2020.81203"],"references":["348686256_Brain_tumor_classification_using_Probabilistic_Neural_Network","306157770_Automatic_Segmentation_of_Brain_Tumour_from_Multiple_Images_of_Brain_MRI","304460791_GLOBOCAN_2012_v10_cancer_incidence_and_mortality_worldwide_IARC_cancer_base_no_11_Internet_International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer_Lyon","290166913_Neuro-Fuzzy_Systems"]}
