{"id":"323868147_Management_Information_System_in_Fully_Connected_Network_Topology","abstract":"Management Information System (MIS), fully connected computer networks and travelling salesman problem (TSP) are three\nimportant distinct concepts in mathematics and computer science. The concept of MIS is generally used for financial information. Keeping this\nview, it is tried to correlate these concept to do better sequential performance among nodes of fully connected computer network. There exist\ndifferent topological structure of computer network but only fully connected network topology is a complete graph. Information may pass from\ninitial node to final node in fully connected nodes and if extra properties added in it that final node will acknowledged to initial node then there\nexist scope to use mathematical travelling salesman concept in it.","authors":["Manoj Kumar Srivastav"],"meta":["February 2018"],"references":["260360281_Graph_Theory_With_Application_to_Engineering_and_Computer_Science"]}
