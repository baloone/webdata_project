{"id":"222458159_Application_of_Kalman_filtering_to_track_and_vertex_fitting","abstract":"Recently iterative procedures have been proposed for track and vertex fitting in counter experiments. We show that the proper theoretical framework for these procedures is the theory of linear filtering, in particular the Kalman filter. Using results from filtering theory we confirm and extend the previous results. We also discuss the detection of outliers and of secondary vertices.","authors":["Rudolf Fr√ºhwirth"],"meta":["December 1987Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A Accelerators Spectrometers Detectors and Associated Equipment 262(2-3):444-450","DOI:10.1016/0168-9002(87)90887-4"],"references":["38365282_Series_Representations_of_Distributions_of_Quadratic_Forms_in_Normal_Variables_II_Non-Central_Case","245112648_Estimation_of_variances_in_a_linear_model_applied_to_measurements_of_trajectories","243632598_Track_fitting_with_multiple_scattering_A_new_method","50237938_Track_element_merging_strategy_and_vertex_fitting_in_complex_modular_detectors","23885861_Stochastic_Processes_And_Filtering_Theory"]}
