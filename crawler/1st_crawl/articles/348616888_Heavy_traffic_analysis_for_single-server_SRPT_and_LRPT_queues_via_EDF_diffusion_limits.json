{"id":"348616888_Heavy_traffic_analysis_for_single-server_SRPT_and_LRPT_queues_via_EDF_diffusion_limits","abstract":"Extending the results of Kruk (Queueing theory and network applications. QTNA 2019. Lecture notes in computer science, vol 11688. Springer, Cham, pp 263–275, 2019), we derive heavy traffic limit theorems for a single server, single customer class queue in which the server uses the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) policy from heavy traffic limits for the corresponding Earliest Deadline First queueing systems. Our analysis allows for correlated customer inter-arrival and service times and heavy-tailed inter-arrival and service time distributions, as long as the corresponding stochastic primitive processes converge weakly to continuous limits under heavy traffic scaling. Our approach yields simple, concise justifications and new insights for SRPT heavy traffic limit theorems of Gromoll et al. (Stoch Syst 1(1):1–16, 2011). Corresponding results for the longest remaining processing time policy are also provided.","authors":["Łukasz Kruk"],"meta":["January 2021Annals of Operations Research","DOI:10.1007/s10479-021-03929-0"],"references":["335335219_Diffusion_Limits_for_SRPT_and_LRPT_Queues_via_EDF_Approximations","324631722_Markov_Processes_Characterization_and_Convergence","319830182_More_Stochastic-Process_Limits","318916738_Diffusion_Limits_for_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Queues","301579670_Fluid_Limits_for_Multiple-Input_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Queues","292799109_Heavy_traffic_in_a_system_with_a_discipline_of_priority_servicing_for_the_job_of_shortest_remaining_length_with_interruption","274497441_Analysis_of_SRPT_scheduling","266750869_A_system_with_Schrage_servicing_discipline_in_the_case_of_a_high_load","266553825_Diffusion_approximation_for_a_GG1_EDF_queue_with_unbounded_lead_times","265368190_Convergence_of_Random_Processes_and_Limit_Theorems_in_Probability_Theory"]}
