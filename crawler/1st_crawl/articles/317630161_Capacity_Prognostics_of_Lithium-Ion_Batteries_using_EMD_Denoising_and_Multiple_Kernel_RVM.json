{"id":"317630161_Capacity_Prognostics_of_Lithium-Ion_Batteries_using_EMD_Denoising_and_Multiple_Kernel_RVM","abstract":"Lithium-ion batteries are crucial to many types of electric equipments. Hence, lithium-ion battery capacity prognostic is significantly important, and it is yet very hard for the measured battery data are regularly polluted by miscellaneous noises. In this paper, a battery capacity prognostic approach using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) denoising method and multiple kernel relevance vector machine (MKRVM) approach is presented. EMD denoising method is employed to process the measured capacity data to produce noise-free capacity data. Battery capacity prediction model using MKRVM is constructed based on the denoised capacity data. Meanwhile, the MKRVM’s kernel contains diversified by using multiple heterogeneous kernel learning method, and its sparse weights of basic kernel functions are yielded by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The measured battery capacity data are used to demonstrate the effect of EMD denoising method, and battery capacity prediction experiments reveal that the proposed MKRVM approach can predict the battery’s future capacity precisely.","authors":["Chaolong Zhang","He Yigang","Lifeng Yuan","Sheng Xiang"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Access
