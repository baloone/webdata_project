{"id":"267260764_RELIABILITY_as_a_STRATEGIC_INITIATIVE_To_Improve_Manufacturing_Capacity_Throughput_and_Profitability","abstract":"Maintenance suffers from a deficiency of understanding and respect. It is probably fair to say that most people (even management) think the role of maintenance is to \"fix things when they break\". That could hardly be further from the truth! When things break down, maintenance has failed! The maintenance job is to \"maintain it so that it never breaks\". Chronic problems are far too common in most manufacturing plantsï£§machine downtime, rejects, waste, production delays are rampant in most plants. Effective capacity is lost (increasing capital investment), costs are increased (at a loss of competitiveness), and profits are reduced (at a loss of business viability). A typical manufacturing plant has hundreds, even thousands, of equipment components that can create problems in a myriad of ways. Plant Managers and Production Managers often don't understand the reasons behind these chronic problems and thus miss one of the biggest strategic opportunities available to make improvements in capacity, throughput, and profits! The challenge is to gain recognition, at all levels, in all departments, that maintenance is a strategic tool ...just as JIT, CIM, Six Sigma, Lean, or any of the other \"world class\" methods and techniques being implemented to improve a company's competitive edge. Maintenance can play a major role in reducing quality defects, increasing production capacity and throughput, and improving overall plant productivity and profitability, not as an \"also ran\", but as a primary contributor. But for maintenance to make that contribution, it must be recognized as an integral part of the plant production strategy --an integral component of the overall plan by which the plant provides its product to the customer at the quality he wants at the price he wants to pay.","authors":["Dale R Blann"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
