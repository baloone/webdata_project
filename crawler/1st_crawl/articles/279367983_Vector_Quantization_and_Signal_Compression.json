{"id":"279367983_Vector_Quantization_and_Signal_Compression","abstract":"There is no better way to quantize a single vector than to use VQ with a codebook that is optimal for the probability distribution describing the random vector. However, direct use of VQ suffers from a serious complexity barrier that greatly limits its practical use as a complete and self-contained coding technique","authors":["Allen Gersho","Robert M Gray"],"meta":["January 1992","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4615-3626-0_12","In book: Vector Quantization and Signal Compression (pp.407-485)"],"references":[]}
