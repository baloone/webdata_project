{"id":"327004465_Towards_Generation_of_Ambiguous_Situations_in_Virtual_Environments_for_Training","abstract":"Ambiguous situations are referred to as situations that are open to more than one interpretation. Our objective is to train individuals to handle this kind of situations using Virtual Environments for Training (VET). However, producing a large panel of ambiguous situations adapted to the learner requires serious authoring efforts. To address this issue, we propose to generate these situations automatically without having to write them beforehand.","authors":["Azzeddine Benabbou","Domitile Lourdeaux","Dominique Lenne"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-98572-5_61","Conference: 13th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2018At: Leeds, UK","Project: ANR MacCoy Critical"],"references":["228857471_Adaptive_thinking_leadership_simulation_game_training_for_Special_Forces_officers","225139913_Exploring_the_Suitability_of_Virtual_Environments_for_Safety_Training_Signals_Norms_and_Ambiguity_in_a_Simulated_Emergency_Escape","314390255_Ambiguity_as_a_resource_for_design","312542623_Simulation_and_virtual_reality-based_learning_of_non-technical_skills_in_driving_critical_situations_diagnostic_and_adaptation","309476347_Risk_ambiguity_and_the_Savage_axioms","291801823_Recent_Developments_in_Modeling_Preferences_Uncertainty_and_Ambiguity","257271707_Analysing_uncertainties_Towards_comparing_Bayesian_and_interval_probabilities'","230818255_Risk_Ambiguity_and_the_Savage_AxiomsReply","227938345_Propagation_of_Uncertainty_in_Risk_Assessments_The_Need_to_Distinguish_Between_Uncertainty_Due_to_Lack_of_Knowledge_and_Uncertainty_Due_to_Variability","226729975_White_Paper_on_Risk_Governance_Toward_an_Integrative_Framework"]}
