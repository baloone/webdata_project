{"id":"290822224_Fundamental_and_Practical_Aspects_of_the_Chemical_Vapor_Infiltration_of_Porous_Substrates","abstract":"CVI is a new technique for depositing a solid from a gaseous precursor in the pore network of a porous substrate. It is particularly suited to the deposition of ceramics. The deposition rate depends on both the mass transfer of gaseous species in the pores and kinetics of the surface chemical reactions. In isothermal/isobaric CVI, mass transfer in the pores is only by diffusion (including Knudsen diffusion for the small pores). Thus, infiltration must be performed at low temperature and pressure to avoid an early sealing of pore entrances and to allow a significant filling of the pores. It is a rather slow process but it can be applied simultaneously to a large number of substrates even of complex shapes (e.g., to the fabrication of ceramic matrix fibrous composites). In forced-CVI, a pressure/temperature gradient is applied to the substrate with the result that (i) mass transfer in the pores is mainly by forced convection and (ii) the infiltration rate is increased by one order of magnitude. The use of forced-CVI raises a problem of tooling and seems to be only suited to the treatment of a single substrate of simple shape.","authors":["R. Naslain","F.
