{"id":"356596686_Mobile_Computing_as_a_Support_to_Teach_the_Concept_of_Function","abstract":"We make a proposal to teach the concept of function using mobile computing. This proposal is based on research that has support in education theories such as Constructivism and Problem Solving Learning. In the first part we show the difficulties that undergraduate Computer Science students have in the first semester of Engineering while working with that mathematical concept. And application to be used by the students anywhere and anytime in mobile devices is designed that process data and is intended to show them the concept of function in a problem solving situation. The proposed activities are part of the education methodology used in the research and within this paper we show the diagnostic questionnaire as one of the methodological tools and its results supporting the designed activities and its application to mobile devices","authors":["Elena Fabiola Ruiz Ledesma","Juan Jesús Gutiérrez García"],"meta":["November 2021","DOI:10.46300/91015.2021.15.22"],"references":["277733635_Ingenieria_didactica_en_educacion_matematica","254035465_Integrating_mobile_culture_into_computing_education","224587946_Use_your_mobile_computing_devices_to_learn_-_Contextual_mobile_learning_system_design_and_case_studies","270309829_Revisiting_Mathematics_Education","250891608_Locating_starting_points_in_differential_equations_A_realistic_mathematics_education_approach","232837917_Science_modelling_in_pre-calculus_How_to_make_mathematics_problems_contextually_meaningful","225304514_Mobile_Computing_Principles","28208174_Modelos_matematicos_a_traves_de_proyectos","26442330_EBP_como_metodologia_activa_para_la_ensenanza_del_calculo_diferencial_discusion_y_reflexion_sobre_algunos_problemas_de_calculo_en_las_ciencias_economicas"]}
