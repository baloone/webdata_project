{"id":"331479571_Modeling_and_analysis_of_process_parameters_in_multi-pass_four-roll_bending","abstract":"According to the analysis on the forming mechanism of the multi-pass roll bending and the force conditions of the plate, the relationships between bending moment and curvature during the loading and unloading stages were deduced, and the mathematical model of multi-pass four-roll bending was developed. Based on the model, the influences of the number of bending passes and plate thickness on the bending force and driving torque were discussed. The research results show that the bending force and the driving torque of each pass are dependent on the interval values of two successive finished bend radius and the initial radius of curvature of each pass. The method that increasing the interval values of two successive finished bend radius in previous bending passes and reducing it in subsequent bending passes is conducive to improve the bender capacity. With the increase of the plate thickness, the driving torque increases when the plates are formed to the same radius of curvature. Â© 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Plasticity Engineering.
