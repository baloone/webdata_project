{"id":"344465057_Evaluation_of_Performance_of_the_Students_in_Engineering_Colleges_Overtime_-A_Case_Study","abstract":"The future success of Indian industry depends on the growth of quality engineering education. Yet, there is significant unemployment among graduating engineers, due to their poor quality. India produces a large number of engineers every year. So why do industry leaders complain about the absence of quality engineers for their industries?. In India, the brightest students opt for engineering after the 12th standard. This has resulted in a spurt of engineering colleges, mainly in the private sector. This is because of the inconsistency of the performance of the students basing on various factors of which some of them are quantitative and qualitative nature. We made an attempt to know the associations of performance over different time periods in the three engineering disciplines viz. Mechanical, Computer science and Information technology in a four year Engineering course. This evaluation makes us to think over it and identify the various factors causing the downfall and to take the necessary action to improve the performance based value education.","authors":["A Pavanan Kumari","Venugopal Thothathri"],"meta":["October 2020"],"references":["247836032_The_Development_of_Engineering_and_Technical_Education_in_India"]}
