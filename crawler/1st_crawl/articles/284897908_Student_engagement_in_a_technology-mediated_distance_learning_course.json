{"id":"284897908_Student_engagement_in_a_technology-mediated_distance_learning_course","abstract":"Student engagement plays a central role in educational effectiveness and strong empirical support relates it to learning achievements. This paper reports an exploratory study on three types of engagement: behavioural, cognitive and emotional. A case-study approach was adopted to examine how six students engaged in the course with an online learning platform. Data concerning the three types of engagement were collected through weekly individual interviews over a semester Results suggest that tutorial schedules and assignment deadlines were main positive factors of behavioural engagement, and study load of other courses and work commitment were negative factors. In addition, age emerged not only as a key factor influencing the level of behavioural engagement, but also for cognitive engagement. Older students were found evidently more cogmtively engaged, which was reflected in how they studied the course. Peer group relationship and teacher support were uncovered as factors facilitating emotional engagement.","authors":["K.C. Li","H.K.
