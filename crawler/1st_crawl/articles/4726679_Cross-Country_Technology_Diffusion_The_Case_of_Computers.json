{"id":"4726679_Cross-Country_Technology_Diffusion_The_Case_of_Computers","abstract":"We use data on imports of computer equipment for a large sample of countries between 1 970 and 1990 to investigate the determinants of computer-technology adoption. We find strong evidence that computer adoption is associated with higher levels of human capital and with manufacturing trade openness vis-a-vis the OECD. We also find evidence that computer adoption is enhanced by high investment rates, good property rights protection, and a small share of agriculture in GDP. Finally, there is some evidence that adoption is reduced by a large share of government in GDP, and increased by a large share of manufacturing. After controlling for the above-mentioned variables, we do not find an independent role for the English- (or European-) language skills of the population.","authors":["Wilbur John Coleman II","Francesco Caselli"],"meta":["February 2001American Economic Review 91(2):328-335","DOI:10.1257/aer.91.2.328","SourceRePEc"],"references":["24101086_Evidence_on_Learning_and_Network_Externalities_in_the_Diffusion_of_Home_Computers","24091637_Computing_Inequality_Have_Computers_Changed_The_Labor_Market","5193885_World_Trade_Flows_1970-1992_with_Production_and_Tariff_Data","5149789_Reopening_the_Convergence_Debate_A_New_Look_at_Cross-Country_Growth_Empirics","4901384_Technological_Progress_Mobility_and_Economic_Growth","269822754_International_RandD_Spillovers","246295491_General_Purpose_Technologies_and_Economic_Growth","242496685_How_computers_have_changed_the_wage_structure_evidence_from_micro_data","227458307_Endogenous_Growth_Theory","227358777_Education_for_Technology_Readiness_Prospects_for_Developing_Countries","24091398_How_Computers_Have_Changed_the_Wage_Structure_Evidence_From_Microdata_1984-1989","23573537_Innovation_and_Growth_in_a_Global_Economy","5177142_Why_Do_New_Technologies_Complement_Skills_Directed_Technical_Change_And_Wage_Inequality","4907635_International_Comparisons_of_Education_Attainment","4730986_Technological_Revolutions","2556952_1974"]}
