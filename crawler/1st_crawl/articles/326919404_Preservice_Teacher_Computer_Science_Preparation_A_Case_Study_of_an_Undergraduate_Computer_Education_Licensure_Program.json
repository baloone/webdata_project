{"id":"326919404_Preservice_Teacher_Computer_Science_Preparation_A_Case_Study_of_an_Undergraduate_Computer_Education_Licensure_Program","abstract":"This study presents the design of a Computer Education Licensure (CEL) program based on a situated learning theory framework. The study captures instructors' design considerations while designing the courses in the CEL program based on this theoretical framework. The study also captures preservice teachers and alumni perceptions regarding the value of courses that were informed by this framework. Additionally, the study presents longitudinal data from four preservice teachers who pursued their license from the CEL program, and later moved into teaching positions. Longitudinal interview data began capturing perceptions and experiences during participants' internship year in the CEL program and continued into their first and second years of inservice teaching. Based on the analysis of data from these sources, we conclude that situated learning characteristics were present in all courses of the CEL program. The use of three specific situated learning characteristics (authentic contexts, authentic activities, and reflection) were emphasized by all instructors as being major considerations in course design. Despite this, teachers only emphasized the value of having authentic contexts and authentic activities. Suggestions for similar computer science licensure programs are recommended based on these findings.","authors":["Gamze Ozogul","Michael Karlin","Anne Ottenbreit-Leftwich"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Technology and Teacher Education 26(3):375-409","Project: Computer Science Education, Preservice Computer Science"],"references":["303668799_Computational_Thinking_for_All_Pedagogical_Approaches_to_Embedding_21st_Century_Problem_Solving_in_K-12_Classrooms","301716623_Computer_science_in_K-12_school_curricula_of_the_2lst_century_Why_what_and_when","286636769_Computer_science_teacher_professional_development_in_the_United_States_a_review_of_studies_published_between_2004_and_2014","281297791_The_'dark_side_of_the_moon'_A_critical_look_at_teacher_knowledge_construction_in_collaborative_settings","258187532_The_Effects_of_Situated_Learning_Through_a_Community_Partnership_in_a_Teacher_Preparation_Program","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","241423878_Constructing_21st-Century_Teacher_Education","240801788_Classroom_Conflict_Controversy_Versus_Debate_in_Learning_Groups","234825132_Computer_science_teacher_preparation_is_critical","228862078_Situating_Teachers'_Instructional_Practices_in_the_Institutional_Setting_of_the_School_and_District","228601299_Strategies_for_preparing_preservice_social_studies_teachers_to_integrate_technology_effectively_Models_and_practices","227570961_The_Teaching_of_Science_and_the_History_of_Science","223527654_When_Theory_Meets_Practice_What_student_teachers_learn_from_guided_reflection_on_their_own_classroom_discourse","32957977_Content_Analysis_A_Flexible_Methodology","343364402_Running_on_Empty_the_Failure_to_Teach_K--12_Computer_Science_in_the_Digital_Age","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","317953395_Qualitative_research_and_evaluation_methods","316949058_Concepts_and_Practices_Designing_and_Developing_A_Modern_K-12_CS_Framework","316946049_CSTA_K-12_CS_Standards_for_All_Abstract_Only","314296321_Building_a_Statewide_Computer_Science_Teacher_Pipeline","313219637_An_overview_of_content_analysis_in_practical_assessment","311471279_Toward_a_K-12_computer_science_curriculum","309253979_Education_for_life_and_work_Developing_transferable_knowledge_and_skills_in_the_21st_century","306548592_Situated_learning_Multiple_perspectives","277877290_Teaching_for_Application_A_Model_for_Assisting_Pre-Service_Teachers_With_Technology_Integration","274490628_Surveys_in_Social_Research","262162155_Spreading_the_word_Introducing_pre-service_teachers_to_programming_in_the_K-12_classroom","258801562_Learning_in_context_Technology_integration_in_a_teacher_preparation_program_informed_by_situated_learning_theory","254591766_The_Role_of_Field_Experience_in_the_Preparation_of_Reflective_Teachers","250750529_If_You_Build_Teachers_Will_Students_Come_The_Role_of_Teachers_in_Broadening_Computer_Science_Learning_for_Urban_Youth","240801266_Drawing_Valid_Meaning_from_Qualitative_Data_Toward_a_Shared_Craft","239060987_A_Restatement_of_the_Relation_of_Reflective_Thinking_To_The_Educative_Process","236144141_The_art_of_Case_Study_Research","234684232_Reflectivity_and_Effectiveness_of_Preservice_Teachers_in_a_Unique_Field_Experience","234622281_A_History_of_Ideas_in_Science_Education_Implications_for_Practice","233094999_A_tutoring_model_for_promoting_the_pedagogical-disciplinary_skills_of_prospective_teachers","225413873_Self-presentation_bias_in_surveys_of_teachers'_educational_technology_practices","223139090_Reflection_in_Teacher-Education_-_Towards_Definition_and_Implementation","222576884_Reframing_one's_teaching_Discovering_our_teacher_selves_through_reflection_and_inquiry","222024863_When_is_student_teaching_teacher_education","221537390_Improving_secondary_CS_education_progress_and_problems","49176543_Situated_Cognition_and_Culture_of_Learning","44829137_Educating_the_Reflective_Practitioner_Toward_a_New_Design_for_Teaching_and_Learning_in_the_Professions","4835563_Subject_Area_Preparation_of_Secondary_Mathematics_and_Science_Teachers_and_Student_Achievement"]}
