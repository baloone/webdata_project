{"id":"220434591_Fundamental_forms_of_information","abstract":"Fundamental forms of information, as well as the term information itself, are defined and developed for the purposes of information science/studies. Concepts of natural and represented information (taking an uncon- ventional sense of representation), encoded and em- bodied information, as well as experienced, enacted, expressed, embedded, recorded, and trace information are elaborated. The utility of these terms for the disci- pline is illustrated with examples from the study of infor- mation-seeking behavior and of information genres. Distinctions between the information and curatorial sciences with respect to their social (and informational) objects of study are briefly outlined.","authors":["Marcia J.
