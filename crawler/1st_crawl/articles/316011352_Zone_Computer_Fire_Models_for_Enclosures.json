{"id":"316011352_Zone_Computer_Fire_Models_for_Enclosures","abstract":"Understanding the behavior offire in compartments is of interest to the fire protection engineer for both fire safety design and postfire reconstruction. Such understanding may be obtained by examining experimental fires (full or reduced scale) or by fire models using mathematical techniques to represent the processes encountered in compartment fires by interrelated expressions based on physics and chemistry. The two major classes of fire models for analyzing enclosure fire development are stochastic and deterministic. Â© Society of Fire Protection Engineers 2016.
