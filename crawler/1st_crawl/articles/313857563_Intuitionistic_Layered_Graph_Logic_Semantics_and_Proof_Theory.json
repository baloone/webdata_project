{"id":"313857563_Intuitionistic_Layered_Graph_Logic_Semantics_and_Proof_Theory","abstract":"Models of complex systems are widely used in the physical and social sciences, and the concept of layering, typically building upon graph-theoretic structure, is a common feature. We describe an intuitionistic substructural logic that gives an account of layering. The logic is a bunched system, combining the usual intuitionistic connectives, together with a non-commutative, non-associative conjunction (used to capture layering) and its associated implications. We give soundness and completeness theorems for a labelled tableaux system with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. We then give an equivalent relational semantics, itself proven equivalent to an algebraic semantics via a representation theorem. We utilise this result in two ways. First, we prove decidability of the logic by showing the finite embeddability property holds for the algebraic semantics. Second, we prove a Stone-type duality theorem for the logic. By introducing the notions of ILGL hyperdoctrine and indexed layered frame we are able to extend this result to a predicate version of the logic and prove soundness and completeness theorems for an extension of the layered graph semantics . We indicate the utility of predicate ILGL with a resource-labelled bigraph model.","authors":["Simon Docherty","David Pym"],"meta":["February 2017Logical Methods in Computer Science 14(4)","DOI:10.23638/LMCS-14(4:11)2018"],"references":["267654307_The_finite_embeddability_property_for_residuated_groupoids","235626322_A_Survey_of_Residuated_Lattices","228635528_Compositional_Shape_Analysis","221602709_BI_Hyperdoctrines_and_Higher-Order_Separation_Logic","220898649_Spatial_Logics_for_Bigraphs","220888963_A_degree_centrality_in_multi-layered_social_network","220588732_Modeling_hop-constrained_and_diameter-constrained_minimum_spanning_tree_problems_as_Steiner_tree_problems_over_layered_graphs","220431326_Compositional_Shape_Analysis_by_Means_of_Bi-Abduction","51724814_Rule-based_multi-level_modeling_of_cell_biological_systems","7069802_Layered_Complex_Networks","303913048_Intuitionistic_Layered_Graph_Logic","301882324_Resource-distribution_via_Boolean_constraints","298809434_A_calculus_and_logic_of_bunched_resources_and_processes","281425897_Layered_graph_logic_as_an_assertion_language_for_access_control_policy_models","281390706_A_Modal_Separation_Logic_for_Resource_Dynamics","275166094_The_formal_strong_completeness_of_partial_monoidal_Boolean_BI","270752720_Erratum_to_A_substructural_logic_for_layered_graphs","267170210_A_discipline_of_mathematical_systems_modelling","263161470_Generalized_Galois_Logics_Relational_Semantics_of_Nonclassical_Logical_Calculi","263161407_Algebraic_Methods_in_Philosophical_Logic","243777300_From_categorial_grammar_to_bilinear_logic","243702300_On_the_Calculus_of_Syntactic_Types","237131537_Semantical_Analysis_of_Intuitionistic_Logic_I","234784651_Design_Philosophy_of_the_DARPA_Internet_protocols","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","224053735_Generalising_canonical_extension_to_the_categorical_setting","221942985_Linear_Logic","220897656_A_Spatial_Logic_for_Querying_Graphs","220689276_The_Space_and_Motion_of_Communicating_Agents","220217881_Topological_analysis_of_a_two_coupled_evolving_networks_model_for_business_systems","220173294_Algebra_and_logic_for_resource-based_systems_modelling","50853886_Tableaux_and_Resource_Graphs_for_Separation_Logic","38373144_The_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications","38356739_Tableau_methods_of_proof_for_modal_logics","2895661_BI_as_an_Assertion_Language_for_Mutable_Data_Structures","2558732_Possible_Worlds_and_Resources_The_Semantics_of_BI"]}
