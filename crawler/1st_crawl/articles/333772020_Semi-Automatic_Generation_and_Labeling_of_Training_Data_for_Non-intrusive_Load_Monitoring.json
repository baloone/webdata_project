{"id":"333772020_Semi-Automatic_Generation_and_Labeling_of_Training_Data_for_Non-intrusive_Load_Monitoring","abstract":"User awareness is one of the main drivers to reduce unnecessary energy consumption in our homes. This awareness, however, requires individual energy data of the devices we own. A retrofittable way to get this data is to use Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring methods. Most of these methods are supervised and require to collect labeled ground truth data in advance. Labeling on-phases of devices is already a tedious process, but if further information about internal device states are required (e.g. intensity of an HVAC), manual labeling methods are infeasible. We propose a novel data collection and labeling method for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring. This method uses intrusive sensors directly connected to the monitored devices. A post-processing step classifies the connected devices into four categories and exposes internal state sequences in a semi-automatic way. We evaluated our labeling method with a sample dataset comparing the amount of recognized events, states and classified device category. The event detector achieved a total F1 score of 86.52 % for devices which show distinct states in its power signal. Using our framework, the overall labeling effort is cut by more than half (42%).","authors":["Benjamin VÃ¶lker","Philipp Scholl","Bernd Becker"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1145/3307772.3328295","Conference: the Tenth ACM International Conference"],"references":["325773738_Engineering_and_deploying_a_hardware_and_software_platform_to_collect_and_label_non-intrusive_load_monitoring_datasets","325773104_Developing_and_evaluating_a_probabilistic_event_detector_for_non-intrusive_load_monitoring","324046116_BLOND_a_building-level_office_environment_dataset_of_typical_electrical_appliances","308986507_SustDataED_A_Public_Dataset_for_Electric_Energy_Disaggregation_Research","304326818_A_Collaborative_Framework_for_Annotating_Energy_Datasets","303691363_Acoustic_Based_Appliance_State_Identifications_for_Fine-Grained_Energy_Analytics","283879547_Monitoring_HVAC_equipment_electrical_loads_from_a_centralized_location_-_Methods_and_field_test_results","273668698_Semi-Automatic_Labeling_for_Public_Non-Intrusive_Load_Monitoring_Datasets","266565253_SustData_A_Public_Dataset_for_ICT4S_Electric_Energy_Research","261673114_NILMTK_An_open_source_toolkit_for_non-intrusive_load_monitoring","234816467_At_the_flick_of_a_switch_detecting_and_classifying_unique_electrical_events_on_the_residential_power_line","325374976_Towards_the_Fusion_of_Intrusive_and_Non-intrusive_Load_Monitoring_A_Hybrid_Approach","296706988_Investigating_the_Switch_Continuity_Principle_Assumed_in_Non-Intrusive_Load_Monitoring_NILM","271504213_The_ECO_Data_Set_and_the_Performance_of_Non-Intrusive_Load_Monitoring_Algorithms","266597071_REDD_A_Public_Data_Set_for_Energy_Disaggregation_Research","257126344_Is_disaggregation_the_holy_grail_of_energy_efficiency_The_case_of_electricity","224082951_Load_Signature_Study-Part_I_Basic_Concept_Structure_and_Methodology","223491718_Nonintrusive_electrical_load_monitoring","37992037_LabelMe_A_Database_and_Web-Based_Tool_for_Image_Annotation","2984633_Nonintrusive_appliance_load_monitoring"]}
