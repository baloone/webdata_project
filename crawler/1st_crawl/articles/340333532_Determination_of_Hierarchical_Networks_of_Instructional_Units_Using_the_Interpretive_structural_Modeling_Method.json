{"id":"340333532_Determination_of_Hierarchical_Networks_of_Instructional_Units_Using_the_Interpretive_structural_Modeling_Method","abstract":"This paper discusses that the idea and method of the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) can well be applied to the determination of learning hierarchies or networks of instructional units. The ISM is one of structure modeling methods, applied to the social system modeling. When the number of instructional units is relatively small and the network is relatively simple, it is easy for teacters to construct the network digraph of instructional units. But when the number of units is large (say 20 or more) and the network is very complicated, it is very hard for them to do it by the traditional method. So, the ISM method is applied to the problem. We can easly get the hierarchical network constructed automatically, for we have only to ponder and decide what the immediate prerequisite or prerequisites of each unit are. The ISM method is very useful and convenient to determine learning hierarchies or networks of instructional units efficiently.","authors":["Takahiro SATO"],"meta":["April 1979","DOI:10.15077/jmet.4.1_9"],"references":[]}
