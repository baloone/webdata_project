We have to introduce teaching techniques to reinforce futuristic thinking and allow students to show their creative capabilities in a more artistic way. This will enhance the real features that distinguish human beings from machines.","authors":["Rosa Leonor Ulloa-Cazarez"],"meta":["October 2019Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines 21(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s10710-019-09365-1","Project: Educational Management: Online Higher Education"],"references":[]}
