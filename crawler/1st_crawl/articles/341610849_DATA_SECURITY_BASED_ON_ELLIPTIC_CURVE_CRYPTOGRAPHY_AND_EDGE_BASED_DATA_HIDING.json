The image processing does the image conversion from digital image and performs an enhancement process on it to get a good result. We try to input a video file which contains a frame or image and converted into an image with some characteristic related to that particular frame typical it is like signal dispensation. Normally today's world produces different dimensional images but the image processing concept converts this into two-dimensional signals for processing. They are applied to many business sectors and internet application to help the end-users. Image processing becomes a core sector in the research area of engineering and computer science discipline. We here using Diffie Hellman Key Exchange generate security key for the transferring information.","authors":["M.Robinson Joel"],"meta":["April 2020JAC: A Journal of Composition Theory 13(4):10-14"],"references":["3343443_LSB_matching_revisited","3308556_Reversible_Data_Embedding_Using_a_Difference_Expansion","329322984_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","223256802_A_steganographic_method_for_images_by_pixel_value_differncing","222568134_A_steganographic_method_for_digital_images_using_side_match","51106282_Efficient_Reversible_Watermarking_Based_on_Adaptive_Prediction-Error_Expansion_and_Pixel_Selection","3383706_Efficient_and_robust_watermarking_algorithm_with_vector_quantisation"]}
