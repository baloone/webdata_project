{"id":"266217430_On_the_Length_of_Programs_for_Computing_Finite_Binary_Sequences_Statistical_Considerations","abstract":"An attempt is made to carry out a program (outlined in a previous paper) for defining the concept of a random or patternless, finite binary sequence, and for subsequently defining a random or patternless, infinite binary sequence to be a sequence whose initial segments are all random or patternless finite binary sequences. A definition based on 2 G. J. Chaitin the bounded-transfer Turing machine is given detailed study, but insufficient understanding of this computing machine precludes a complete treatment. A computing machine is introduced which avoids these difficulties. Key Words and Phrases: computational complexity, sequences, random sequences, Turing machines CR Categories: 5.22, 5.5, 5.6 1. Introduction In this section a definition is presented of the concept of a random or patternless binary sequence based on 3-tape-symbol bounded-transfer Turing machines. 2 These computing machines have been introduced and studied in [1], where a proposal to apply them in this manne...","authors":["Gregory J.
