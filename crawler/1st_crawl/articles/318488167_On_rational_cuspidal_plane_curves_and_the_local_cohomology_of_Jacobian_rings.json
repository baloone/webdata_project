{"id":"318488167_On_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves_and_the_local_cohomology_of_Jacobian_rings","abstract":"This note gives the complete projective classification of rational, cuspidal plane curves of degree at least 6, and having only weighted homogeneous singularities. \nIt also sheds new light on some previous characterizations of free and nearly free curves in terms of Tjurina numbers. Finally, we suggest a stronger form of Terao's conjecture on the freeness of a line arrangement being determined by its combinatorics.","authors":["Alexandru Dimca"],"meta":["July 2017Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici 94(4)","DOI:10.4171/CMH/471","Project: Free and nearly free projective hypersurfaces"],"references":["317650077_On_the_Splitting_types_of_bundles_of_logarithmic_Vector_Fields_Along_Plane_Curves","308409668_Numerical_invariants_and_moduli_spaces_for_line_arrangements","278674221_Free_and_nearly_free_divisors_vsrational_cuspidal_plane_curves","274644782_Free_divisors_and_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves","259915235_Syzygies_and_logarithmic_vector_fields_along_plane_curves","232025280_Application_of_the_theory_of_the_discriminant_to_highly_singular_plane_curves","314239079_Hyperplane_Arrangements_An_Introduction","281119805_Freeness_versus_maximal_global_Tjurina_number_for_plane_curves","261065856_Hilbert_Series_and_Lefschetz_Properties_of_Dimension_One_Almost_Complete_Intersections","238950869_The_local_cohomology_of_the_jacobian_ring"]}
