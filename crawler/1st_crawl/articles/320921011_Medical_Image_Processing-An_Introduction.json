{"id":"320921011_Medical_Image_Processing-An_Introduction","abstract":"Biomedical image processing has experienced dramatic expansion, and has been an interdisciplinary research field attracting expertise from applied mathematics, computer sciences, engineering, statistics, physics, biology and medicine. Computer-aided diagnostic processing has already become an important part of clinical routine. Accompanied by a rush of new development of high technology and use of various imaging modalities, more challenges arise; for example, how to process and analyze a significant volume of images so that high quality information can be produced for disease diagnoses and treatment. The principal objectives of this course are to provide an introduction to basic concepts and techniques for medical image processing and to promote interests for further study and research in medical imaging processing. We will introduce the Medical Image Processing and summarize related research work in this area and describe recent state-of-the-art techniques.","authors":["J Thirumaran","Shylaja .S"],"meta":["November 2014Computer Graphics and Image Processing 4(11):5-611"],"references":["296951366_Magnetic_resonance_imaging_of_stem_cells_The_principles","287333306_Relaxation_Effects_in_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Absorption","222105409_Nuclear_Induction","36847082_MRI_-_The_Basics","36844728_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Concepts_and_Methods","4378064_Principles_of_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_A_Signal_Processing_Perspective"]}
