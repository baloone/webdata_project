{"id":"271224179_Walk-powers_and_homomorphism_bound_of_planar_graphs","abstract":"As an extension of the Four-Color Theorem it is conjectured that every planar\ngraph of odd-girth at least $2k+1$ admits a homomorphism to\n$PC_{2k}=(\\mathbb{Z}_2^{2k}, \\{e_1, e_2, ...,e_{2k}, J\\})$ where $e_i$'s are\nstandard basis and $J$ is all 1 vector. Noting that $PC_{2k}$ itself is of\nodd-girth $2k+1$, in this work we show that if the conjecture is true, then\n$PC_{2k}$ is an optimal such a graph both with respect to number of vertices\nand number of edges. The result is obtained using the notion of walk-power of\ngraphs and their clique numbers.\nAn analogous result is proved for bipartite signed planar graphs of\nunbalanced-girth $2k$. The work is presented on a uniform frame work of planar\nconsistent signed graphs.","authors":["Reza Naserasr","Sagnik Sen","Qiang Sun"],"meta":["July 2016Graphs and Combinatorics 32(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-015-1654-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267436576_Homomorphisms_of_planar_signed_graphs_to_signed_projective_cubes","264625947_Homomorphisms_of_Signed_Graphs","223112560_Signed_graph_coloring","309131542_Homomorphism_bounds_and_edge-colourings_of_K_4-minor-free_graphs","299217659_Grad_and_classes_with_bounded_expansion_III_Restricted_graph_homomorphism_dualities","286031944_Aspects_of_structural_combinatorics_Graph_homomorphisms_and_their_use","271512783_Graph_Theory_and_Applications","264470280_2_-Coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_large_odd-girth","263479544_Mapping_Planar_Graphs_into_Projective_Cubes","230802761_Edge-colouring_eight-regular_planar_graphs","222576294_Homomorphisms_and_edge-colorings_of_planar_graphs","220296814_Grad_and_classes_with_bounded_expansion_III_restricted_dualities","46588221_Packing_six_T-joins_in_plane_graphs","2321658_Aspects_Of_Structural_Combinatorics_Graph_Homomorphisms_and_Their_Use"]}
