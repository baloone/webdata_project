{"id":"260490353_How_many_double_squares_can_a_string_contain","abstract":"Counting the types of squares rather than their occurrences, we consider\nthe problem of bounding the number of distinct squares in a string.\nFraenkel and Simpson showed in 1998 that a string of length n contains\nat most 2n distinct squares. Ilie presented in 2007 an asymptotic upper\nbound of 2n - Theta(log n). We show that a string of length n contains\nat most 5n/3 distinct squares. This new upper bound is obtained by\ninvestigating the combinatorial structure of double squares and showing\nthat a string of length n contains at most 2n/3 double squares. In\naddition, the established structural properties provide a novel proof of\nFraenkel and Simpson's result.","authors":["Antoine Deza","Frantisek Franek","Adrien Thierry"],"meta":["October 2013Discrete Applied Mathematics 180","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2014.08.016"],"references":["226887935_Squares_cubes_and_time-space_efficient_string_searching","259510204_A_-step_approach_to_the_maximum_number_of_distinct_squares_and_runs_in_strings","258219092_A_Computational_Framework_for_Determining_Square-maximal_Strings","257048165_On_the_maximum_number_of_cubic_subwords_in_a_word","243134810_A_simple_proof_that_a_word_of_length_n_has_at_most_distinct_squares","229316865_The_three_squares_lemma_revisited","228833217_More_Results_on_Overlapping_Squares","222506621_How_Many_Squares_Can_a_String_Contain","220148724_A_note_on_the_number_of_squares_in_a_word"]}
