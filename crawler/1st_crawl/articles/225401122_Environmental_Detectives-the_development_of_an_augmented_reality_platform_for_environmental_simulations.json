{"id":"225401122_Environmental_Detectives-the_development_of_an_augmented_reality_platform_for_environmental_simulations","abstract":"The form factors of handheld computers make them increasingly popular among K-12 educators. Although some compelling examples\nof educational software for handhelds exist, we believe that the potential of this platform are just being discovered. This\npaper reviews innovative applications for mobile computing for both education and entertainment purposes, and then proposes\na framework for approaching handheld applications we call “augmented reality educational gaming.” We then describe our development\nprocess in creating a development platform for augmented reality games that draws from rapid prototyping, learner-centered\nsoftware, and contemporary game design methodologies. We provide a narrative case study of our development activities spread\nacross five case studies with classrooms, and provide a design narrative explaining this development process and articulate\nan approach to designing educational software on emerging technology platforms. Pedagogical, design, and technical conclusions\nand implications are discussed.","authors":["Eric Klopfer","Kurt Squire"],"meta":["April 2007Educational Technology Research and Development 56(2):203-228","DOI:10.1007/s11423-007-9037-6"],"references":["330741762_Formative_Research_A_Methodology_for_Creating_and_Improving_Design_Theories","279187451_Doing_Qualitative_Research_A_Handbook","269087709_Creating_context_Design-based_research_in_creating_and_understanding_CSCL","262212627_Science_in_the_palm_of_their_hands","321609664_Portable_Technologies_Science_Learning_in_Context","317953368_Participating_in_classroom_mathematical_practices","313069933_Science_in_the_palms_of_your_hands","312975883_Computer_support_for_knowledge-building_communities","307813767_Instructional_Plans_and_Situated_Learning_The_Challenge_of_Suchman's_Theory_of_Situated_Action_for_Instructional_Designers_and_Instructional_Systems","265092033_Toward_a_Design_Science_of_Education"]}
