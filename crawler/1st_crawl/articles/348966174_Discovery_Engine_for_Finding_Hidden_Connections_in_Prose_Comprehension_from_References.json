{"id":"348966174_Discovery_Engine_for_Finding_Hidden_Connections_in_Prose_Comprehension_from_References","abstract":"Reading is one of the essential practices of modern human learning. Comprehending prose text simply from the available text is particularly challenging as in general the comprehension of prose requires the use of external knowledge or references. Although the processes of reading comprehension have been widely studied in the field of psychology, no algorithm level models for comprehension have yet to be developed. This paper has proposed a comprehension engine consisting of knowledge induction which connects the knowledge space by augmenting associations within it. The connections are achieved through the automatic incremental reading of external references and the capturing of high familiarity knowledge associations between prose concepts. The Ontology Engine is used to find lexical knowledge associations amongst concept pairs, with the objective being to obtain a knowledge space graph with a single giant component to establish a base model for prose comprehension. The comprehension engine is evaluated through experiments with various selected prose texts. Akin to human readers, it could mine reference texts from modern knowledge corpuses such as Wikipedia and WordNet. The results demonstrate the potential efficiency of using the comprehension engine that enhances the quality of reading comprehension in addition to reducing reading time. This comprehension engine is considered the first algorithm level model for comprehension compared with existing works.
