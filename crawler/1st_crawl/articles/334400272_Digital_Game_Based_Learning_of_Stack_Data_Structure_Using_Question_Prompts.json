{"id":"334400272_Digital_Game_Based_Learning_of_Stack_Data_Structure_Using_Question_Prompts","abstract":"p class=\"0abstract\">Data structure and algorithm is an important course in computer science and information technology programs, applied in almost all courses. Failure to master it will affect student's academic performance during study, getting job interviews, passing job interviews, and create an inefficient information technology worker. However, learning data structure is a worldwide problem because of its complex nature. Gameful visualization of data structures’ algorithms has been gaining momentum as it resulted in increased motivation, engagement and learning outcome. But effectiveness of game-based learning could be hindered if improper learning strategies used. Instructional scaffold in game-based learning in the form of question prompts have been found to be the most effective way to scaffold self-learn in computer-based learning. Thus, a game-based learning of stack data structure using question prompts was designed, developed and tested based on an adopted model to help students understand the algorithms of stack’s insert and delete operations for array implementation with gameplay that could create meaningful learning. A pre-game and post-game test was conducted to compare students’ performance on the topic. Results indicated a generally positive outcome.</p","authors":["Rosni Ramle","D'oria Islamiah Rosli","Shelena Soosay Nathan","Mazniha Berahim"],"meta":["July 2019International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 13(07):90","DOI:10.3991/ijim.v13i07.10778"],"references":["333420155_Using_Interactive_Game-based_Animations_for_Teaching_and_Learning_Sorting_Algorithms","332337215_Motivating_Low-Achieving_Learners_to_Use_Mobile_Assistive_Courseware_through_Signaling_Principle","331988113_An_Examination_of_the_Determinants_of_the_Adoption_of_Mobile_Applications_as_Learning_Tools_for_Higher_Education_Students","284178854_Digital_game-based_learning_Still_restless_after_all_these_years","263936571_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Cognitive_and_Motivational_Effects_of_Serious_Games","324971537_Effects_of_a_progressive_prompting-based_educational_game_on_second_graders'_mathematics_learning_performance_and_behavioral_patterns","309273491_Promoting_science_learning_in_game-based_learning_with_question_prompts_and_feedback","265297851_DSLEP_Data_Structure_Learning_Platform_to_Aid_in_Higher_Education_IT_Courses","262248134_Board_game_strategies_in_introductory_computer_science","261490148_Using_serious_game_to_simplify_algorithm_learning"]}
