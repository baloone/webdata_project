{"id":"309738747_SPECTRA_-a_Maple_library_for_solving_linear_matrix_inequalities_in_exact_arithmetic","abstract":"This document briefly describes our freely distributed Maple library spectra, for Semidefinite Programming solved Exactly with Computational Tools of Real Algebra. It solves linear matrix inequalities in exact arithmetic and it is targeted to small-size, possibly degenerate problems for which symbolic infeasibility or feasibility certificates are required.","authors":["Didier Henrion","Simone Naldi","Mohab Safey El Din"],"meta":["November 2016Optimization Methods and Software 34(5)","DOI:10.1080/10556788.2017.1341505"],"references":["292817589_Rational_sums_of_hermitian_squares_of_free_noncommutative_polynomials","282734000_Exact_algorithms_for_determinantal_varieties_and_semidefinite_programming","281084615_Exact_Algorithms_for_Linear_Matrix_Inequalities","255658272_Moments_Positive_Polynomials_and_Their_Applications","220006657_SDPLIB_12_library_of_semidefinite_programming_test_problems","2369376_Todd_MJ_Semidefinite_optimization_Acta_Numer_10_515-560","2277688_Some_Geometric_Results_in_Semidefinite_Programming","2133168_The_Algebraic_Degree_of_Semidefinite_Programming","308362419_Exact_algorithms_for_linear_matrix_inequalities","305387411_Semidefinite_optimization","285688992_Semidefinite_programming","273370931_WHAT_ISa_Spectrahedron","265618277_Semidefinite_optimization_and_convex_algebraic_geometry","230840009_Sums_of_squares_of_polynomials_with_rational_coefficients","225147318_FGb_A_Library_for_Computing_Grobner_Bases","223231946_Computing_sum_of_squares_decompositions_with_rational_coefficients","220160746_Exact_certification_in_global_polynomial_optimization_via_sums-of-squares_of_rational_functions_with_rational_coefficients","29646336_Error_Bounds_on_Complex_Floating-Point_Multiplication","2889272_Semidefinite_Programming","2259572_Using_SeDuMi_102_a_MATLAB_toolbox_for_optimization_over_symmetric_cones","1768552_Sums_of_Hermitian_Squares_and_the_BMV_Conjecture"]}
