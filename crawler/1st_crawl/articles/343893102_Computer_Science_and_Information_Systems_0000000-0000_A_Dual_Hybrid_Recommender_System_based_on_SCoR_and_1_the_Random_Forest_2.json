The two systems 17 are initially combined by splitting the training set into two \"equivalent\" parts, one 18 of which is used to train SCoR while the other is used to train the Random Forest. 19 This initial approach does not exhibit good performance due to reduced training. 20 The resulted drawback is alleviated by the proposed dual training system which, 21 using an innovative splitting method, exploits the entire training set for SCoR and 22 the Random Forest, resulting to two recommender systems that are subsequently 23 efficiently combined. Experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the 24 proposed system on the Movielens datasets. 25","authors":["Costas Panagiotakis","Harris Papadakis","Paraskevi Fragopoulou"],"meta":["August 2020Computer Science and Information Systems","DOI:10.2298/XXXXXXXXX"],"references":["322895764_Deep_Learning_for_Computer_Vision_A_Brief_Review","316735336_User_Occupation_Aware_Conditional_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine_Based_Recommendation","311491355_Ad_Recommendation_Systems_for_Life-Time_Value_Optimization","282492351_Three-way_recommender_systems_based_on_random_forests","257391814_Hybrid_recommendation_approach_for_learning_material_based_on_sequential_pattern_of_the_accessed_material_and_the_learner's_preference_tree"]}
