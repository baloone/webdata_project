{"id":"3755353_Reducing_the_Peak_to_Average_Power_Ratio_of_OFDM","abstract":"The distribution of the peak-to-average power (PAP) ratio of an\nOFDM signal is derived, showing that large PAP ratios only occur very\ninfrequently. Because of this, PAP reducing techniques which distort the\nsignal can be quite effective, since only a small fraction of the OFDM\nsignal has to be distorted. One example of such a technique is peak\nwindowing. It is shown that peak windowing can achieve PAP ratios around\n4 dB for an arbitrary number of subcarriers, at the cost of a slight\nincrease in the BER and out-of-band radiation. Simulations with\nrealistic power amplifier models show that a backoff of about 5 dB is\nrequired to get an out-of-band radiation level of 30 dB below the\nin-band spectral density","authors":["R. van Nee","A. de Wild"],"meta":["June 1998Vehicular Technology Conference, 1988, IEEE 38th 3:2072 - 2076 vol.3","DOI:10.1109/VETEC.1998.686121","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Vehicular Technology Conference, 1998.
