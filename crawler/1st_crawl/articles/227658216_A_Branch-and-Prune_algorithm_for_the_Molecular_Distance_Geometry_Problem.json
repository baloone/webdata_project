{"id":"227658216_A_Branch-and-Prune_algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","abstract":"The Molecular Distance Geometry Problem consists in finding the positions in of the atoms of a molecule, given some of the inter-atomic distances. We show that under an additional requirement on the given distances this can be transformed to a combinatorial problem. We propose a Branch-and-Prune algorithm for the solution of this problem and report on very promising computational results.","authors":["Leo Liberti","Carlile Lavor","Nelson Maculan"],"meta":["January 2008International Transactions in Operational Research 15(1):1 - 17","DOI:10.1111/j.1475-3995.2007.00622.x"],"references":["268018683_Distance_Geometry_and_Molecular_Conformation","239667563_Molecular_Modeling_and_Simulation_An_Interdisciplinary_Guide","227120408_A_linear-time_algorithm_for_solving_the_molecular_distance_geometry_problem_with_exact_inter-atomic_distances","221245986_Rigidity_Computation_and_Randomization_in_Network_Localization","220203621_Rigid_versus_unique_determination_of_protein_structures_with_geometric_buildup","316520062_Molecular_structure_determination_by_convex_global_underestimation_of_local_energy_minima","285981037_Global_continuation_for_distance_geometry_problems","240197669_Proteins_Structures_and_Molecular_Properties","239597445_Embeddability_of_weighted_graphs_in_k-space_is_strongly_NP-hard","229618301_Children's_counting_The_early_formation_of_numerical_symbols","227042121_Distance_Geometry_Optimization_for_Protein_Structures","226220715_On_generating_Instances_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","224908791_Molecular_Modeling_and_Simulation","220416638_Predicting_peptide_structures_using_NMR_data_and_deterministic_global_optimization","30508338_3D_Graph_Drawing_with_Simulated_Annealing","2721977_The_Molecule_Problem_Exploiting_Structure_In_Global_Optimization","2403615_Molecular_Structure_Determination_by_Convex_Global_Underestimation_of_Local_Energy_Minima"]}
