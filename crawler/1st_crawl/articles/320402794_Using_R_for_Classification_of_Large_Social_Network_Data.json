{"id":"320402794_Using_R_for_Classification_of_Large_Social_Network_Data","abstract":"The advent of social networks has changed the research in computer science. Now, the massive volume of data has present in the form of twitter, facebook, emails, IOT (Internet of Things). So, the storage and analysis of these data has become great challenge for researchers. Traditional frameworks have failed for the processing of large data. R is open source programming framework developed for the analysis of large data results better accuracy. It also gives the opportunity of the implementation in R programming language. In this paper, a study on the use of R for the classification of large social network data. Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is used for the classification of large twitter data. The experiment has shown that enormous amount of data can be sufficiently classified using the R framework with promising results.","authors":["Furqan Nasir","Shahbaz Nazeer","Javed Ferzund","Usman Zulfiqar"],"meta":["October 2017International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 15(09):64--69","Project: Social Media Analysis"],"references":["317290255_Using_PCA_and_Factor_Analysis_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_of_Bio-informatics_Data","316682490_Modern_Data_Formats_for_Big_Bioinformatics_Data_Analytics","314270242_Database_Search_Alignment_Viewer_and_Genomics_Analysis_Tools_Big_Data_for_Bioinformatics","314094221_Need_and_Role_of_Scala_Implementations_in_Bioinformatics","312590697_Harnessing_the_Potential_of_Machine_Learning_for_Bioinformatics_using_Big_Data_Tools","309321208_mlr_Machine_Learning_in_R","283551286_RTextTools_A_Supervised_Learning_Package_for_Text_Classification","272425234_A_Comparative_Study_on_Decision_Tree_and_Random_Forest_Using_R_Tool","5142924_Support_Vector_Machines_in_R","287043845_PivotalR_A_Package_for_Machine_Learning_on_Big_Data"]}
