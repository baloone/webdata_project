{"id":"328678407_Paving_a_path_to_more_inclusive_computing","abstract":"The need for computing science (CS) education has reached unprecedented levels, creating myriad opportunities for computing science educators to have significant impact on the educational landscape. From riding the wave of growing enrollments, to better understanding modalities for success in CS education through research, to embracing a broad perspective of computing as a substrate for work in other fields, there is no shortage of opportunities to pursue. We must, however, also be mindful of the social structure surrounding our field and inculcate a healthy, inclusive culture in computing if we are to fully realize the promise that broad computing education offers.","authors":["Mehran Sahami"],"meta":["November 2018ACM Inroads 9(4):85-88","DOI:10.1145/3230700"],"references":["310818888_Replication_Validation_and_Use_of_a_Language_Independent_CS1_Knowledge_Assessment","220815237_Dynamic_Student_Modelling_in_an_Intelligent_Tutor_for_LISP_Programming","326395523_Assessing_and_responding_to_the_growth_of_computer_science_undergraduate_enrollments","316858624_Computer_Science_Curricula_2013_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Computer_Science","301879726_The_Importance_of_Computing_Education_Research","285945729_Factors_Associated_With_Student_Persistence_in_an_Online_Program_of_Study_A_Review_of_the_Literature","282739167_Autonomously_Generating_Hints_by_Inferring_Problem_Solving_Policies","249313851_Halving_fail_rates_using_peer_instruction_a_study_of_four_computer_science_courses"]}
