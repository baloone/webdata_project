{"id":"317426725_Mobility-Assisted_Device_to_Device_Communications_For_Content_Transmission","abstract":"Device-to-device communications are promising\ntechnology to enhance 5G cellular network. However, mobility\ngreatly affects the transmission capacity of proximal devices.\nIn this paper, we investigate the problem of mobility-assisted\ncontent transmission and resource allocation by leveraging the\ncontact patterns determined by proximal users. We formulate\nthe problem with the help of statistical properties of contact\nrate, and utilize convex optimization to solve the problem of\ncontent transmission and resource allocation for mobile users.We\npropose the optimal Resource Allocated Content Transmission\n(RACT) algorithm based on pseudo-polynomial time algorithm\nusing dynamic programming. Extensive simulations are evaluated\nunder realistic mobility factors, which indicates the efficiency of\nour proposed RACT algorithm.","authors":["Muhammad Waqas","Ming Zeng","Yong Li"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986287","Conference: IEEE - International Wireless Communication and Mobile Computing Conference (IEEE_-IWCMC)At: Valencia, Spain"],"references":["307088181_Share_communication_and_computation_resources_on_mobile_devices_A_social_awareness_perspective","304530746_Mobility-Aware_Caching_and_Computation_Offloading_in_5G_Ultra-Dense_Cellular_Networks","299538714_Characterization_of_User_Mobility_in_Cellular-Assisted_D2D_Systems","257299276_A_Survey_on_Device-to-Device_Communication_in_Cellular_Networks","254061548_Operator_controlled_Device-to-Device_communications_in_LTE-Advanced_networks","236936093_Power_Control_for_D2D_Underlaid_Cellular_Networks_Modeling_Algorithms_and_Analysis","221654073_Human_mobility_social_ties_and_link_prediction","316287913_Primitives_towards_verifiable_computation_a_survey","312169319_Security_and_Privacy_in_Device-to-Device_D2D_Communication_A_Review","309916697_A_novel_approach_of_mobility_management_for_the_D2D_communications_in_5G_mobile_cellular_network_system","307526366_How_to_Download_More_Data_from_Neighbors_A_Metric_for_D2D_Data_Offloading_Opportunity","305705562_Movement-based_incentive_for_cellular_traffic_offloading_through_D2D_communications","305675892_Mobility_increases_throughput_of_wireless_device-to-device_networks_with_coded_caching","290474755_Efficient_Cellular_Load_Balancing_Through_Mobility-Enriched_Vehicular_Communications","283563034_Interference_Coordination_in_Heterogeneous_Small-Cell_Networks_A_Coalition_Formation_Game_Approach","276845323_Social-Aware_Resource_Allocation_for_Device-to-Device_Communications_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","275243797_Mobility_Models_Traces_and_Impact_of_Mobility_on_Opportunistic_Routing_Algorithms_A_Survey","273001794_Approximation_Algorithms","267627590_A_dynamic_coalition_formation_framework_for_interference_management_in_dense_small-cell_networks","263813540_Optimal_Mobile_Content_Downloading_in_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","263813382_Coalitional_Games_for_Resource_Allocation_in_the_Device-to-Device_Uplink_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","263003228_Analytical_Modeling_of_Mode_Selection_and_Power_Control_for_Underlay_D2D_Communication_in_Cellular_Networks","262231678_The_role_of_mobility_for_D2D_communications_in_LTE-advanced_networks_Energy_vs_bandwidth_efficiency","233387748_Efficiency_Resource_Allocation_for_Device-to-Device_UnderlayCommunication_Systems_A_Reverse_Iterative_Combinatorial_Auction_BasedApproach"]}
