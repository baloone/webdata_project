{"id":"336209946_Cochrane_Handbook_for_Systematic_Reviews_of_Interventions","abstract":"The revised edition of the Handbook offers the only guide on how to conduct, report and maintain a Cochrane Review.\n\nThe second edition of The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions contains essential guidance for preparing and maintaining Cochrane Reviews of the effects of health interventions. Designed to be an accessible resource, the Handbook will also be of interest to anyone undertaking systematic reviews of interventions outside Cochrane, and many of the principles and methods presented are appropriate for systematic reviews addressing research questions other than effects of interventions.\n\nThis fully updated edition contains extensive new material on systematic review methods addressing a wide-range of topics including network meta-analysis, equity, complex interventions, narrative synthesis, and automation. Also new to this edition, integrated throughout the Handbook, is the set of standards Cochrane expects its reviews to meet. \n\nWritten for review authors, editors, trainers and others with an interest in Cochrane Reviews, the second edition of The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions continues to offer an invaluable resource for understanding the role of systematic reviews, critically appraising health research studies and conducting reviews.","authors":["Elie Akl","Douglas G Altman","Patricia Aluko","Lisa M Askie"],"meta":["October 2019","Edition: 2Publisher: John Wiley & SonsEditor: Julian PT Higgins, James Thomas, Jacqueline Chandler, Miranda Cumpston, Tianjing Li, Matthew J Page, Vivian A WelchISBN: 9781119536604","Projects: systematic reviews, qualitative evidence synthesis, mixed method reviewsAdverse effects in systematic reviews: identification, synthesis, and reportingSystematic Review Methods (Focusing on Search and Infomation Management)"],"references":["333615002_Systematic_mapping_of_existing_tools_to_appraise_methodological_strengths_and_limitations_of_qualitative_research_First_stage_in_the_development_of_the_CAMELOT_tool","330647047_Taking_account_of_context_in_systematic_reviews_and_guidelines_considering_a_complexity_perspective","330644318_Implications_of_a_complexity_perspective_for_systematic_reviews_and_guideline_development_in_health_decision_making","328871247_Synthesising_quantitative_and_qualitative_evidence_to_inform_guidelines_on_complex_interventions_Clarifying_the_purposes_designs_and_outlining_some_methods","328353734_Improving_reporting_of_meta-ethnography_The_eMERGe_Reporting_Guidance","326621712_Qualitative_evidence_synthesis_for_complex_interventions_and_guideline_development_Clarification_of_the_purpose_designs_and_relevant_methods","330682083_School-based_self-management_interventions_for_asthma_in_children_and_adolescents_A_mixed_methods_systematic_review","324573428_Exercise_interventions_and_patient_beliefs_for_people_with_hip_knee_or_hip_and_knee_osteoarthritis_A_mixed_methods_review","323844661_Structured_methodology_review_identified_seven_RETREAT_criteria_for_selecting_qualitative_evidence_synthesis_approaches","323025073_Children's_views_about_obesity_body_size_shape_and_weight_a_systematic_review","322708708_Applying_GRADE-CERQual_to_qualitative_evidence_synthesis_findings_Introduction_to_the_series","321959383_Engagement_of_stakeholders_in_the_development_of_a_Theory_of_Change_for_handwashing_and_sanitation_behaviour_change","321830806_Cochrane_Qualitative_and_Implementation_Methods_Group_Guidance_series_-_paper_6_Methods_for_question_formulation_searching_and_protocol_development_for_qualitative_evidence_synthesis","321786043_Cochrane_Qualitative_and_Implementation_Methods_Group_Guidance_paper_2_Methods_for_assessing_methodological_limitations_data_extraction_and_synthesis_and_confidence_in_synthesized_qualitative_findings","321739506_Cochrane_Qualitative_and_Implementation_Methods_Group_Guidance_Paper_4_Methods_for_integrating_qualitative_and_implementation_evidence_within_intervention_effectiveness_reviews"]}
