{"id":"305910935_A_simple_sequential_outlier_detection_with_several_residuals","abstract":"Outlier detection schemes have been used to identify the unwanted noise and this helps us to obtain underlying valuable signals and predicting the next state of the systems/signals. However, there are few researches on sequential outlier detection in time series although a lot of outlier detection algorithms are developed in off-line systems. In this paper, we focus on the sequential (on-line) outlier detection schemes, that are based on the ‘delete-replace’ approach. We also demonstrate that three different types of residuals can be used to design the outlier detection scheme to achieve accurate sequential estimation: marginal residual, conditional residual, and contribution.","authors":["Ji Won Yoon"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362805","Conference: 2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)"],"references":["260557115_Active_Hypothesis_Testing_for_Quickest_Anomaly_Detection","220638052_A_Survey_of_Outlier_Detection_Methodologies","220565847_Anomaly_Detection_A_Survey","3359067_Novelty_detection_using_extreme_value_statistics","308733166_Universal_sequential_outlier_hypothesis_testing","269298300_LD-Sketch_A_distributed_sketching_design_for_accurate_and_scalable_anomaly_detection_in_network_data_streams","254331112_Simplifying_General_Least_Squares","227763540_Outliers_Level_Shifts_and_Variance_Changes_in_Time_Series","227688788_Residuals_for_the_linear_model_with_general_covariance_structure","6312089_Outliers_Detection_in_Multivariate_Time_Series_by_Independent_Component_Analysis","4993286_Application_of_'delete_replace'_to_deletion_diagnostics_for_variance_component_estimation_in_the_linear_mixed_model","4771962_A_Simple_Derivation_of_Deletion_Diagnostic_Results_for_the_General_Linear_Model_with_Correlated_Errors"]}
