{"id":"283986398_Software_Defined_Optical_Networks_SDONs_A_Comprehensive_Survey","abstract":"The emerging software defined networking (SDN) paradigm separates the data\nplane from the control plane and centralizes network control in an SDN\ncontroller. SDN facilitates the virtualization of network functions so that\nmultiple virtual networks can operate over a given installed physical network.\nOptical network segments, such as passive optical networks (PONs), have become\nimportant for providing network access. In this article, we comprehensively\nsurvey studies that examine the concepts of SDN and network virtualization in\noptical access networks; in brief, we survey the area of software defined\noptical access networks (SDOANs). We organize the SDOAN studies into\narchitecture and protocol focused studies. We then subclassify the studies\naccording to the network layers. In particular, for protocol-focused studies,\nwe consider subclassifications for the physical layer, medium access control\n(link) layer, and network layer. In addition, we consider subclassifications\nfor studies focused on quality of service, multilayer (multitechnology)\nnetworking, and virtualization. Based on the survey, we identify open\nchallenges for SDOANs and outline future directions.","authors":["Anu Mercian","Michael Mcgarry","Martin Reisslein","Wolfgang Kellerer"],"meta":["November 2015IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials 18(4)","DOI:10.1109/COMST.2016.2586999","SourcearXiv"],"references":["346398328_Application-aware_software-defined_EPON_access_network","321877045_Optical_Network_Design_and_Planning","316807220_Optical_Networks","314628820_Cross-layer_dynamic_network_orchestration_leveraging_software-defined_optical_performance_monitors","312978859_Flexible_traffic_management_in_broadband_access_networks_using_software_defined_networking","311460815_Integrated_SDNNFV_Orchestration_for_the_Dynamic_Deployment_of_Mobile_Virtual_Backhaul_Networks_over_a_Multi-layer_PacketOptical_Aggregation_Infrastructure","311460732_The_Need_for_a_Transport_API_in_5G_networks_the_Control_Orchestration_Protocol","311460407_Multi-layer_and_Multi-domain_Network_Orchestration_by_ODENOS","310055033_Security_in_software_defined_networks_A_survey","309425847_Dynamic_and_Adaptive_Control_Plane_Solutions_for_Flexi-grid_Optical_Networks_based_on_Stateful_PCE"]}
