{"id":"301276744_A_fast_and_effective_subset_sum_based_improvement_procedure_for_workload_balancing_on_identical_parallel_machines","abstract":"The paper on hand addresses the workload balancing problem that asks for an assignment of n independent jobs to m identical parallel machines so that the normalized sum of squared workload deviations (NSSWD-criterion) is minimized. For the special case of m=3 machines we propose an exact algorithm that requires solving a sequence of subset sum problems. This algorithm also builds the core of our local search procedure for solving the general case of m â‰¥ 3 machines. The main innovation of our approach compared to existing methods, therefore, consists in using triples of machines as a neighborhood instead of pairs of machines. Results of a comprehensive computational study on the benchmark library established by Ho et al. [10] and Cossari et al. [5] attest to the effectiveness of our approach. In addition, we demonstrate its capability to determine high-quality solutions for further balancing criteria as discussed in Cossari et al. [6].","authors":["Stefan Schwerdfeger","Rico Walter"],"meta":["September 2016Computers & Operations Research 73:84-91","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2016.03.008"],"references":["301598220_Improved_approaches_to_the_exact_solution_of_the_machine_covering_problem","257919068_Workload_balancing_in_identical_parallel_machine_scheduling_using_a_mathematical_programming_method","226147419_A_performance_guarantee_for_the_greedy_set-partitioning_algorithm","271673887_Minimizing_workload_balancing_criteria_on_identical_parallel_machines","265129782_A_note_on_minimizing_the_normalized_sum_of_squared_workload_deviations_on_m_parallel_processors","261570914_Comparing_the_effectiveness_of_workload_balancing_objectives_in_FMS_loading","251313811_Comparing_the_minimum_completion_times_of_two_longest-first_scheduling-heuristics","251090726_A_Greedy-heuristic_for_3-partitioning_with_similar_elements","244913798_Tight_upper_bound_for_the_k-partition_problem_on_ideal_sets","244416507_A_polynomial-time_approximation_scheme_for_maximizing_the_minimum_machine_completion_time","225692353_Workflow_balancing_strategies_in_parallel_machine_scheduling","222029329_Minimizing_the_normalized_sum_of_square_for_workload_deviations_on_m_parallel_processors","220617774_Worst-Case_Analysis_of_a_Placement_Algorithm_Related_to_Storage_Allocation","220471175_A_new_heuristic_for_workload_balancing_on_identical_parallel_machines_and_a_statistical_perspective_on_the_workload_balancing_criteria","220340235_Maximizing_the_minimum_completion_time_on_parallel_machines","220151330_An_analysis_of_the_LPT_algorithm_for_the_max-min_and_the_min-ratio_partition_problems","220114615_Tighter_Bounds_on_a_Heuristic_for_a_Partition_Problem","200031473_Approximation_Schemes_for_Scheduling_on_Parallel_Machines","4940014_An_improved_delayed-start_LPT_algorithm_for_a_partition_problem_on_two_identical_parallel_machines","4868674_Partitioning_under_the_Lp_norm","2314243_Approximation_Schemes_for_Scheduling"]}
