Previous studies have been conducted to evaluate the comparability of Computer-based testing (CBT) and paper-pencil testing (PPT). Some studies revealed significant differences between the two testing modes on test score, testing time and testing motivation, while others have reported opposite or inconsistent results. However, most of the studies have been conducted through basic experimental or quasi-experimental designs without identifying testing effects on test takers. In experimental designs, testing effects influence the cause-effect relationship between the treatment (testing modes) and experimental variables. Therefore, the findings might be misinterpreted. This study employed a Solomon four-group experimental design to (1) identify the reliability of the two testing modes, (2) identify and compare the testing effects between the two testing modes, and (3) examine the effects of the two testing modes on test score, testing time and testing motivation. Results indicate that as a whole, testing effects significantly influenced testing time and testing motivation for the PPT mode. The CBT mode was more reliable in terms of internal and external validities and it reduced testing time and increased testing motivation of the participants.","authors":["Yan Piaw Chua"],"meta":["January 2011","Conference: The Informatics Conference,At: University of Malaya"],"references":["265218400_The_Green_PDF_Reducing_Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions_One_Ream_at_a_Time_The_Green_PDF_Reducing_Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions_One_Ream_at_a_Time","251713994_Establishing_a_brain_styles_test_The_YBRAINS_test","237559622_Dimensions_of_Children's_Motivation_for_Reading_and_Their_Relations_to_Reading_Activity_and_Reading_Achievement","313552311_Reading_motivation_A_domain-specific_approach_to_motivation","265047840_Computer-based_testing_vs_paper-based_testing_A_comprehensive_approach_to_examining_the_comparability_of_testing_modes","242692245_Comparability_of_Computerized_Adaptive_and_Paper-Pencil_Tests","241677351_Technology_in_testing_The_present_and_the_future","233907624_Computer_versus_Paper-and-Pencil_Assessment_of_Educational_Development_A_Comparison_of_Psychometric_Features_and_Examinee_Preferences","233896189_Reading_motivation_A_domain-specific_approach_to_motivation","232571173_How_Motivation_Fits_Into_a_Science_of_Reading"]}
