{"id":"254012870_Survey_on_NoSQL_database","abstract":"With the development of the Internet and cloud computing, there need databases to be able to store and process big data effectively, demand for high-performance when reading and writing, so the traditional relational database is facing many new challenges. Especially in large scale and high-concurrency applications, such as search engines and SNS, using the relational database to store and query dynamic user data has appeared to be inadequate. In this case, NoSQL database created. This paper describes the background, basic characteristics, data model of NoSQL. In addition, this paper classifies NoSQL databases according to the CAP theorem. Finally, the mainstream NoSQL databases are separately described in detail, and extract some properties to help enterprises to choose NoSQL.","authors":["Jing Han","Ee Haihong","Guan Le","Jian Du"],"meta":["October 2011","DOI:10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106531"],"references":["224266062_A_Novel_Solution_of_Distributed_Memory_NoSQL_Database_for_Cloud_Computing","221257619_Cassandra_structured_storage_system_on_a_P2P_network","220439168_Bigtable_A_Distributed_Storage_System_for_Structured_Data"]}
