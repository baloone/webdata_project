{"id":"260515484_Omnidirectional_Circularly_Polarized_Dielectric_Resonator_Antenna_With_Top-Loaded_Alford_Loop_for_Pattern_Diversity_Design","abstract":"A new compact omnidirectional circularly polarized (CP) cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) with a top-loaded modified Alford loop is investigated. Fed by an axial probe, the DRA is excited in its TM01δ-mode, which radiates like a vertically polarized electric monopole. The modified Alford loop comprises a central circular patch and four curved branches. It is placed on the top of the DRA and provides an equivalent horizontally polarized magnetic dipole mode. Omnidirectional CP fields can be obtained when the two orthogonally polarized fields are equal in amplitude but different in phase by 90°. This CP DRA is applied to the design of a two-port CP diversity DRA which provides omnidirectional and broadside radiation patterns. The broadside radiation pattern is obtained by making use of the broadside HEM12δ+ 1-mode of the DRA, which is excited by a balanced slot serially fed by a microstrip line. For demonstration, both the omnidirectional CP DRA and the diversity CP DRA were designed at ~ 2.4 GHz for WLAN applications. Their S-parameters, axial ratios, radiation patterns, antenna gains, and antenna efficiencies are studied. The envelope correlation is also found for the diversity design. Reasonable agreement between the simulated and measured results is observed.","authors":["Wei Wei Li","Kwok Wa Leung"],"meta":["August 2013IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 61(8):4246-4256","DOI:10.1109/TAP.2013.2262072"],"references":["254062522_Omnidirectional_Linearly_and_Circularly_Polarized_Rectangular_Dielectric_Resonator_Antennas","252036485_Correlation_coefficient_expression_by_S-parameters_for_two_omni-directional_MIMO_antennas","224251781_A_Wideband_Circularly_Polarized_Conical_Beam_From_a_Two-Arm_Spiral_Antenna_Excited_in_Phase","3385819_Exact_presentation_of_antenna_system_diversity_performance_from_input_parameter_description","3018571_A_Wideband_Circularly_Polarized_Conical-Beam_Patch_Antenna","261233008_Dual_polarized_rectangular_DRA_for_3GPP","254059968_Wideband_Omnidirectional_Circularly_Polarized_Dielectric_Resonator_Antenna_With_Parasitic_Strips","254059608_A_MNG-TL_Loop_Antenna_Array_With_Horizontally_Polarized_Omnidirectional_Patterns","243136109_EHF_dielectric_resonator_antenna_array","241194058_Compact_CPW-Fed_Dielectric_Resonator_Antenna_With_Dual_Polarization","239765975_Dual-Band_Omnidirectional_Circularly_Polarized_Antenna_Using_Zeroth_and_First-Order_Modes","236263277_Frequency-_and_Time-Domain_Performance_of_Four-Arm_Mode-2_Spiral_Antennas","236107518_Omnidirectional_Cylindrical_Dielectric_Resonator_Antenna_With_Dual_Polarization","227933221_Low-profile_omnidirectional_circularly_polarized_antenna_for_WLAN_Access_points","227737522_Compact_circularly_polarized_omnidirectional_microstrip_antenna","224613551_The_Significance_of_Radiation_Efficiencies_When_Using_S-Parameters_to_Calculate_the_Received_Signal_Correlation_From_Two_Antennas","224577749_A_Dual-Frequency_Omnidirectional_Antenna_for_Polarization_Diversity_of_MIMO_and_Wireless_Communication_Applications","224560494_Dual-polarised_dielectric_resonator_antenna_with_high_isolation_and_low_cross-polarisation","224498807_Ultrahigh-Frequency_Loop_Antennas","224248804_A_Cross-Shaped_Dielectric_Resonator_Antenna_for_Multifunction_and_Polarization_Diversity_Applications","224236555_Omnidirectional_Circularly_Polarized_Antenna_Utilizing_Zeroth-Order_Resonance_of_Epsilon_Negative_Transmission_Line","224138547_Reconfigurable_Circularly-Polarized_Patch_Antenna_With_Conical_Beam","4088701_A_low-profile_omnidirectional_circularly_polarized_antenna_for_WLAN_access_point","3469624_A_Helical_Antenna_for_Circular_Polarization","3399874_Resonant_Hemispherical_Dielectric_Antenna","3398955_Rectangular_Dielectric_Resonator_Antenna","3304679_Recent_Advances_in_Dielectric-Resonator_Antenna_Technology","3304606_Research_on_circularly_polarized_conical-beam_antennas","3129055_Computed_Modal_Field_Distribution_for_Isolated_Dielectric_Resonators","3018831_A_Horizontally_Polarized_Omnidirectional_Printed_Antenna_for_WLAN_Applications","3017055_Dual-polarized_dielectric_resonator_antennas","3015770_The_Resonant_Dielectric_Cavity_Antenna"]}
