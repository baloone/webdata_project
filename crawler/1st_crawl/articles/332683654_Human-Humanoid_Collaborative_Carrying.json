{"id":"332683654_Human-Humanoid_Collaborative_Carrying","abstract":"This paper contributes to the field of physical human-robot collaboration. We present a complete control framework which aims at making humanoid robots capable of carrying objects together with humans. Firstly, we design a template identifying the primitive subtasks necessary for collaborative carrying. Then, these subtasks are formulated as constrained optimization problems for controlling the whole-body motion of a humanoid robot. The subtasks include two walking pattern generators that account for physical collaboration, as well as posture and grasping controllers. Finally, we validate our framework in a variety of collaborative carrying experiments, using the HRP-4 humanoid robot.","authors":["Andrea Cherubini","Don Joven Agravante","Abderrahmane Kheddar","Alexander Sherikov"],"meta":["April 2019IEEE Transactions on Robotics","DOI:10.1177/ToBeAssignedï¿¿"],"references":["330798343_Differential_game_theory_for_versatile_physical_interaction","324574101_A_Dynamical_System_Approach_to_Task-Adaptation_in_Physical_Human-Robot_Interaction","319656334_Analysis_of_Rigid_Extended_Object_Co-Manipulation_by_Human_Dyads_Lateral_Movement_Characterization","328857377_Quadratic_Programming_for_Multirobot_and_Task-Space_Force_Control","327811385_Generating_Assistive_Humanoid_Motions_for_Co-Manipulation_Tasks_with_a_Multi-Robot_Quadratic_Program_Controller","326907846_Human_Intention_Detection_as_a_Multiclass_Classification_Problem_Application_in_Human-Robot_Physical_Interaction_while_Walking","325186475_Multicontact_Postures_Computation_on_Manifolds","322320396_Capture-point_based_balance_and_reactive_omnidirectional_walking_controller","316805996_Rigid_Body_Dynamics_Algorithms","310590065_A_Newton_Method_with_Always_Feasible_Iterates_for_Nonlinear_Model_Predictive_Control_of_Walking_in_a_Multi-Contact_Situation"]}
