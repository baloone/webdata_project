{"id":"292951625_Moving_To_The_Cloud_Transitioning_From_Client-Server_To_Service_Architecture","abstract":"This paper makes the case that the traditional three-tier client-server architecture requires a major overhaul to address the changing and rapidly increasing information processing and services needs of consumers. Revisions to the conventional architecture model are suggested and two examples of information systems applications are discussed to illustrate how the new information service architecture fits into the realm of future systems development.","authors":["Manoj A.
