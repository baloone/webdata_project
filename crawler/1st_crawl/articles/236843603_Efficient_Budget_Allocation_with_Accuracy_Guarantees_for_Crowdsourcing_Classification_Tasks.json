{"id":"236843603_Efficient_Budget_Allocation_with_Accuracy_Guarantees_for_Crowdsourcing_Classification_Tasks","abstract":"In this paper we address the problem of budget allocation for redundantly crowdsourcing a set of classification tasks where a key challenge is to find a trade-off between the total cost and the accuracy of estimation. We propose CrowdBudget, an agent-based budget allocation algorithm, that efficiently divides a given budget among different tasks in order to achieve low estimation error. In particular, we prove that CrowdBudget can achieve at most max{0, K/2- O,(âˆšB)} estimation error with high probability, where K is the number of tasks and B is the budget size. This result significantly outperforms the current best theoretical guarantee from Karger et al,. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods by up to 40% in experiments based on real-world data from a prominent database of crowdsourced classification responses.","authors":["Long Tran-Thanh","Matteo Venanzi","Alex Rogers","Nicholas R.
