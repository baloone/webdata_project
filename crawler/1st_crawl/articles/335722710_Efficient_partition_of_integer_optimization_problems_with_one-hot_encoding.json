{"id":"335722710_Efficient_partition_of_integer_optimization_problems_with_one-hot_encoding","abstract":"Quantum annealing is a heuristic algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems, and hardware for implementing this algorithm has been developed by D-Wave Systems Inc. The current version of the D-Wave quantum annealer can solve unconstrained binary optimization problems with a limited number of binary variables. However, the cost functions of several practical problems are defined by a large number of integer variables. To solve these problems using the quantum annealer, integer variables are generally binarized with one-hot encoding, and the binarized problem is partitioned into small subproblems. However, the entire search space of the binarized problem is considerably larger than that of the original integer problem and is dominated by infeasible solutions. Therefore, to efficiently solve large optimization problems with one-hot encoding, partitioning methods that extract subproblems with as many feasible solutions as possible are required. In this study, we propose two partitioning methods and demonstrate that they result in improved solutions.","authors":["Shuntaro Okada","Masayuki Ohzeki","Shinichiro Taguchi"],"meta":["September 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-49539-6"],"references":["337367884_Control_of_Automated_Guided_Vehicles_Without_Collision_by_Quantum_Annealer_and_Digital_Devices","334484033_Item_Listing_Optimization_for_E-Commerce_Websites_Based_on_Diversity","331102843_Improving_solutions_by_embedding_larger_subproblems_in_a_D-Wave_quantum_annealer","323597968_Observation_of_topological_phenomena_in_a_programmable_lattice_of_1800_qubits","321945163_Traffic_Flow_Optimization_Using_a_Quantum_Annealer","321416021_Quantum-Assisted_Learning_of_Hardware-Embedded_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models","344253952_Efficient_Quantum_and_Simulated_Annealing_of_Potts_Models_Using_a_Half-hot_Constraint","331187196_Quantum_Annealing_of_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_State_and_Capacity_First_International_Workshop_QTOP_2019_Munich_Germany_March_18_2019_Proceedings","328897620_First_Results_Solving_Arbitrarily_Structured_Maximum_Independent_Set_Problems_Using_Quantum_Annealing","326399373_Phase_transitions_in_a_programmable_quantum_spin_glass_simulator"]}
