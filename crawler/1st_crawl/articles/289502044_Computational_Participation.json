{"id":"289502044_Computational_Participation","abstract":"Understanding the computational concepts on which countless digital applications run offers learners the opportunity to no longer simply read such media but also become more discerning end users and potentially innovative “writers” of new media themselves. To think computationally—to solve problems, to design systems, and to process and organize information drawing on concepts fundamental to computer science—is seen as a crucial problem-solving skill in the new millennium. It is not a matter of turning all adolescents into computer scientists but rather leveraging coding as a means to get youths more engaged in the workings of the Web-based media that surround them.","authors":["Quinn Burke","W.
