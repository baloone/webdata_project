{"id":"332530035_Hybrid_Location-based_Recommender_System_for_Mobility_and_Travel_Planning","abstract":"In recent times, the modern developments of internet technologies and social networks have attracted global researchers to explore the recommender systems for generating personalized location-based services. Recommender Systems (RSs) as proven decision support tools have gained immense popularity to solve information overloading problem among various real-time applications of e-commerce, travel and tourism, movies and e-learning. RSs emerge as a popular and reliable information filtering approach that is capable of suggesting relevant items, movies, and locations to the active target user based on dynamic preferences and interests. Beyond the development of many feature-rich recommendation algorithms, the need for a better full-fledged RS to produce precise and highly relevant recommendations based on ratings and preferences provided by the target user is very high. With the specific focus to the travel domain, the global research community has been involved in the development of a complete travel recommender system that is immune to the sparsity and cold start problems. In this paper, we present a new Hybrid Location-based Travel Recommender System (HLTRS) through exploiting ensemble based co-training method with swarm intelligence algorithms to enhance the personalized travel recommendations. The proposed HLTRS is experimentally validated on the real-world large-scale dataset, and we have made an extensive user study to determine the ability of developed RS to produce user satisfiable recommendations in real-time scenarios. The obtained results and analyses demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed Hybrid Location-based Travel Recommender System over existing baselines of recommender systems research.","authors":["Logesh R.","Subramaniyaswamy V","Vijayakumar Varadarajan","Siguang Chen"],"meta":["August 2019Mobile Networks and Applications 24(1â€“2)","DOI:10.1007/s11036-019-01260-4"],"references":["331795027_Hybrid_bio-inspired_user_clustering_for_the_generation_of_diversified_recommendations","329103715_Intelligent_cyber-physical_system_for_an_efficient_detection_of_Parkinson_disease_using_fog_computing","329042685_Enhancing_recommendation_stability_of_collaborative_filtering_recommender_system_through_bio-inspired_clustering_ensemble_method","331454720_Intelligent_sentiment_analysis_approach_using_edge_computing-based_deep_learning_technique","330641029_Swarm_intelligence_clustering_ensemble_based_point_of_interest_recommendation_for_social_cyber-physical_systems","330494307_Location-based_personalized_recommender_system_in_the_internet_of_cultural_things","330057691_Effective_Knowledge_Based_Recommender_System_for_Tailored_Multiple_Point_of_Interest_Recommendation","330054250_Hybrid_Reasoning-based_Privacy-Aware_Disease_Prediction_Support_System","329446297_Fog_Computing-based_Intelligent_Healthcare_System_for_the_Detection_and_Prevention_of_Mosquito-borne_Diseases","326994060_Boosting_Collaborative_Filtering_with_an_Ensemble_of_Co-trained_Recommenders","325322652_Efficient_User_Profiling_Based_Intelligent_Travel_Recommender_System_for_Individual_and_Group_of_Users","324214015_An_ontology-driven_personalized_food_recommendation_in_IoT-based_healthcare_system","326985580_Exploring_Hybrid_Recommender_Systems_for_Personalized_Travel_Applications_Proceeding_of_CISC_2017","326167351_CoRec_a_co-training_approach_for_recommender_systems","323671944_An_Efficient_Hybrid_Clustering_Method_based_on_Improved_Cuckoo_Optimization_and_Modified_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithms"]}
