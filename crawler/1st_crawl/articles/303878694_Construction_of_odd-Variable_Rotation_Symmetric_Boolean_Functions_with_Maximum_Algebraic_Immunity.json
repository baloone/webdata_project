{"id":"303878694_Construction_of_odd-Variable_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","abstract":"Rotation symmetric Boolean functions (RSBFs) that are invariant under circular translation of indices have been used as components of different cryptosystems. In this paper, odd-variable balanced RSBFs with maximum algebraic immunity (AI) are investigated. We provide a construction of n-variable (n = 2k + 1 odd and n >= 13) RSBFs with maximum AI and nonlinearity >= 2(n-1) - ((n-1)(k)) + 2(k) + 2(k-2) - k, which have nonlinearities significantly higher than the previous nonlinearity of RSBFs with maximum AI.","authors":["Shaojing Fu","Jiao Du","Longjiang Qu","Chao Li"],"meta":["April 2016IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics Communications and Computer Sciences E99A(4):853-855","DOI:10.1587/transfun.E99.A.853"],"references":["258649896_Constructing_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity_on_an_Odd_Number_of_Variables","235640002_Highly_Nonlinear_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Good_Behavior_Against_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","225634095_Basic_Theory_in_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Possible_Annihilator_Immunity","225597786_Further_properties_of_several_classes_of_Boolean_functions_with_optimum_algebraic_immunity","224242489_Balanced_rotation_symmetric_boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity","221348381_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Boolean_Functions","220684774_On_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_High_Algebraic_Immunity_on_Even_Number_of_Variables","220681152_Constructing_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","220236232_Annihilators_and_Algebraic_Immunity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","51952918_On_-Variable_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","272030177_Two_constructions_of_balanced_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_high_nonlinearity_and_good_behavior_against_fast_algebraic_attacks","257554710_Construction_of_rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_and_high_nonlinearity","242518319_Construction_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_optimal","220639279_A_conjecture_on_binary_string_and_its_applicationson_constructing_Boolean_functions_of_optimal_algebraic_immunity","3085862_Symmetric_Boolean_functions_depending_on_an_odd_number_of_variables_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity"]}
