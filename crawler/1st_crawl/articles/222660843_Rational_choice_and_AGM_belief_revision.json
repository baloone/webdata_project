{"id":"222660843_Rational_choice_and_AGM_belief_revision","abstract":"We establish a correspondence between the rationalizability of choice studied in the revealed preference literature and the notion of minimal belief revision captured by the AGM postulates. A choice frame consists of a set of alternatives Ω, a collection E of subsets of Ω (representing possible choice sets) and a function f:E→Ω2 (representing choices made). A choice frame is rationalizable if there exists a total pre-order R on Ω such that, for every E∈E, f(E) coincides with the best elements of E relative to R. We re-interpret choice structures in terms of belief revision. An interpretation is obtained by adding a valuation V that assigns to every atom p the subset of Ω at which p is true. Associated with an interpretation is an initial belief set and a partial belief revision function. A choice frame is AGM-consistent if, for every interpretation of it, the associated partial belief revision function can be extended to a full-domain belief revision function that satisfies the AGM postulates. It is shown that a finite choice frame is AGM-consistent if and only if it is rationalizable.","authors":["Giacomo Bonanno"],"meta":["August 2009Artificial Intelligence 173(12-13):1194-1203","DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2009.05.001","SourceDBLP"],"references":["262935779_Relations_between_the_logic_of_theory_change_and_nonmonotonic_logic","257479457_Belief_Revision","233794890_Relations_between_the_logic_of_theory_change_and_nonmonotonic_logic","228626555_A_qualitative_theory_of_dynamic_interactive_belief_revision","226353907_How_to_Go_Nonmonotonic","225503900_Prolegomena_to_Dynamic_Logic_for_Belief_Revision","225203164_Relations_between_the_logic_of_theory_change_and_nonmonotonic_logic","223766985_Nonmonotonic_Reasoning_Preferential_Models_and_Cumulative_Logics","220607934_Dynamic_doxastic_logic_Why_how_and_where_to","220316041_On_the_Logic_of_Theory_Change_Partial_Meet_Contraction_and_Revision_Functions","29858525_Shifting_Priorities_Simple_Representations_for_Twenty-Seven_Iterated_Theory_Change_Operators","4903737_Revising_preferences_and_choices","2584364_Iterated_Revision_and_Minimal_Change_of_Conditional_Beliefs","303841491_A_Qualitative_Theory_of_Dynamic_Interactive_Belief_Revision","294684571_Knowledge_and_Belief","274189705_Knowledge_in_Flux_Modeling_the_Dynamics_of_Epistemic_States","266524057_Modal_Logic","260405234_Change_Choice_and_Inference","259810884_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","248182869_Two_Traditions_in_the_Logic_of_Belief_Bringing_them_Together","245056776_A_semantical_analysis_of_modal_logic_ii_Non-normal_propositional_calculi","242640524_Modal_Logic_An_Introduction","232492592_Knowledge_in_Flux_Modeling_the_Dynamic_of_Epistemic_States","227998801_Semantical_Analysis_of_Modal_Logic_I_Normal_Modal_Propositional_Calculi","227388657_Rational_Choice_Collective_Decisions_and_Social_Welfare","226495326_Choice_structures_and_preference_relations","226026449_Two_Modellings_for_Theory_Change","222654215_Axiomatic_characterization_of_the_AGM_theory_of_belief_revision_in_a_temporal_logic","222577247_Dynamic_belief_revision_operators","222517986_Dynamic_Interactive_Epistemology","222489050_On_the_Logic_of_Iterated_Belief_Revision","222232245_Propositional_knowledge_base_revision_and_minimal_change","220245478_Belief_Revision_From_the_Point_of_View_of_Doxastic_Logic","220202618_Dynamic_Logic_for_Belief_Revision","49548770_Knowledge_and_belief","46710093_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic"]}
