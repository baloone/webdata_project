{"id":"316770749_Frequency-driven_tabu_search_for_the_maximum_s_-plex_problem","abstract":"The maximum s-plex problem is an important model for social network analysis and other studies. In this study, we present an effective frequency-driven multi-neighborhood tabu search algorithm (FD-TS) to solve the problem on very large networks. The proposed FD-TS algorithm relies on two transformation operators (Add and Swap) to locate high-quality solutions, and a frequency-driven perturbation operator (Press) to escape and search beyond the identified local optimum traps. We report computational results for 47 massive real-life (sparse) graphs from the SNAP Collection and the 10th DIMACS Challenge, as well as 52 (dense) graphs from the 2nd DIMACS Challenge (results for 48 more graphs are also provided in the Appendix). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting comparisons with the current best-performing algorithms.","authors":["Yi Zhou","Jin-Kao Hao"],"meta":["May 2017Computers & Operations Research 86","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2017.05.005"],"references":["305821765_PUSH_a_Generalized_Operator_for_the_Maximum_Vertex_Weight_Clique_Problem","284275447_Exact_MIP-based_approaches_for_finding_maximum_quasi-cliques_and_dense_subgraphs","284138157_Finding_a_maximum_k-club_using_the_k-clique_formulation_and_canonical_hypercube_cuts","278716368_A_review_on_algorithms_for_maximum_clique_problems","276249907_Solving_the_Maximum_Clique_and_Vertex_Coloring_Problems_on_Very_Large_Sparse_Networks","267433461_Graph_partitioning_and_graph_clustering_Proceedings_of_the_10th_DIMACS_implementation_challenge_workshop_Atlanta_GA_USA_February_13-14_2012","306191193_Clique_relaxation_models_in_social_network_analysis","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","277821410_Discovering_large_dense_subgraphs_in_massive_graphs","270850329_A_New_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum-Weight_Clique_Problem"]}
