{"id":"338347983_Postbuckling_analysis_of_hydrostatic_pressurized_FGM_microsized_shells_including_strain_gradient_and_stress-driven_nonlocal_effects","abstract":"Herein, with the aid of the newly proposed theory of nonlocal strain gradient elasticity, the size-dependent nonlinear buckling and postbuckling behavior of microsized shells made of functionally graded material (FGM) and subjected to hydrostatic pressure is examined. As a consequence, the both nonlocality and strain gradient micro-size dependency are incorporated to an exponential shear deformation shell theory to construct a more comprehensive size-dependent shell model with a refined distribution of shear deformation. The Moriâ€“Tanaka homogenization scheme is utilized to estimate the effective material properties of FGM nanoshells. After deduction of the non-classical governing differential equations via boundary layer theory of shell buckling, a perturbation-based solving process is employed to extract explicit expressions for nonlocal strain gradient stability paths of hydrostatic pressurized FGM microsized shells. It is observed that the nonlocality size effect causes to decrease the critical hydrostatic pressure and associated end-shortening of microsized shells, while the strain gradient size dependency leads to increase them. In addition, it is found that the influence of the internal strain gradient length scale parameter on the nonlinear instability characteristics of hydrostatic pressurized FGM microsized shells is a bit more than that of the nonlocal one.","authors":["Xiaohui Yang","Saeid Sahmani","Babak Safaei"],"meta":["April 2021Engineering with Computers 37(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00366-019-00901-2"],"references":["333839043_Nonlocal_strain_gradient_beam_model_for_nonlinear_secondary_resonance_analysis_of_functionally_graded_porous_micronano-beams_under_periodic_hard_excitations","333329856_Radial_postbuckling_of_nanoscaled_shells_embedded_in_elastic_foundations_based_on_Ru's_surface_stress_elasticity_theory","336262410_Surface_elastic_shell_model_for_nonlinear_primary_resonant_dynamics_of_FG_porous_nanoshells_incorporating_modal_interactions","335968516_The_nonlocal_frequency_behavior_of_nanomechanical_mass_sensors_based_on_the_multi-directional_vibrations_of_a_buckled_nanoribbon","334280236_Dynamic_stability_of_viscoelastic_porous_FG_nanoplate_under_longitudinal_magnetic_field_via_a_nonlocal_strain_gradient_quasi-3D_theory","334184839_The_effect_of_cracks_on_the_stability_of_the_functionally_graded_plates_with_variable-thickness_using_HSDT_and_phase-field_theory","334098867_Nonlocal_strain_gradient_nonlinear_resonance_of_bi-directional_functionally_graded_composite_micronano-beams_under_periodic_soft_excitation","333638246_New_observations_on_transverse_dynamics_of_microtubules_based_on_nonlocal_strain_gradient_theory","332716392_Size-dependent_nonlinear_forced_oscillation_of_self-assembled_nanotubules_based_on_the_nonlocal_strain_gradient_beam_model","332406784_Nonlinear_free_vibrations_of_bi-directional_functionally_graded_micronano-beams_including_nonlocal_stress_and_microstructural_strain_gradient_size_effects","329951315_Size-dependent_nonlinear_secondary_resonance_of_micro-nano-beams_made_of_nano-porous_biomaterials_including_truncated_cube_cells","332328116_Free_vibration_analysis_of_rotating_functionally_graded_CNT_reinforced_composite_cylindrical_shells_with_arbitrary_boundary_conditions","330338768_A_novel_approach_for_nonlinear_bending_response_of_macro-_and_nanoplates_with_irregular_variable_thickness_under_nonuniform_loading_in_thermal_environment","329659455_On_buckling_of_porous_double-layered_FG_nanoplates_in_the_Pasternak_elastic_foundation_based_on_nonlocal_strain_gradient_elasticity","328997846_A_Nonlocal_Finite_Element_Model_for_Buckling_and_Vibration_of_Functionally_Graded_Nanobeams"]}
