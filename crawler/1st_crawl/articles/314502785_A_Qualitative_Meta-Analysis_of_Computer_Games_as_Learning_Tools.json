{"id":"314502785_A_Qualitative_Meta-Analysis_of_Computer_Games_as_Learning_Tools","abstract":"Drawing on grounded theory approach and a qualitative meta-analysis, this chapter intends to systematically review and synthesize the theories, methods, and findings of both qualitative and quantitative inquiries on computer-based instructional games. A major purpose of this literature review and meta-analysis is to inform policy and practice based on existing studies. Four major recurring themes concerning the effectiveness of computer-based instructional games have emerged from a comparative analysis with 89 instructional gaming studies and are discussed with the support of exemplar research. The chapter will assist practitioners and policymakers in understanding the “best practices” and key factors of a computer game-based learning program.","authors":["Fengfeng Ke"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.4018/9781599048086.ch001","In book: Handbook of Research on Effective Electronic Gaming in Education"],"references":[]}
