{"id":"308830323_A_Review_on_Classical_and_Non_Classical_Nucleation_Theories","abstract":"Nucleation - the initial process in vapour condensation, crystal nucleation, melting and boiling is the localised emergence of distinct thermodynamic phase in nanoscale that macroscopically grows in size with the attachment of growth units. These phase changes are the result of atomistic events driven by thermal fluctuations. The occurrence of atomistic level events with the length scales of order of 10⁻¹⁰m and the time scales of 10⁻¹³S equivalent to vibrational frequency of atoms makes the nucleation a very complicated phenomenon to study. Even though abundant literature is available about fundamental aspects of nucleation, the knowledge on these phenomena is far from complete. The classical pathway to nucleation which was once considered to have general applicability to all nucleating systems is gradually giving way to non-classical pathway which is now considered as a dominating mechanism in solution crystallization and other systems as well. In this review, an attempt is made to compare underlying physical principles involved in various nucleating systems and their theoretical treatment based on Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT), and other important theories like Density Functional approach and Diffuse Interface Theory (DIT). The limitations of classical theory, the gradual evolution of non-classical two step pathway to nucleation and the questions that has to be addressed in the future are discussed systematically.","authors":["Karthika Shanmugam","T.
