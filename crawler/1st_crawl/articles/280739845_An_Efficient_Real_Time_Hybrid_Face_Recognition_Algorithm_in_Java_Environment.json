{"id":"280739845_An_Efficient_Real_Time_Hybrid_Face_Recognition_Algorithm_in_Java_Environment","abstract":"Image processing over smart phones is a new and exciting field with many challenges due to limited hardware and connectivity problems. Android based mobile phones are now becoming the core of many applications. It is of great importance to build image processing algorithms and codes on Andriod platforms. This paper develops a real time face recognition application model using JAVA language to fulfill Android smart phones. This introduced model uses hybrid skin color-eigen face detection method and interest point localization for feature matching. Results are shown and compared with existing techniques for verification. The aim is to maintain real time measures with high recognition rate. Applications range from security to people with disabilities adaptation.","authors":["Mohamed Abdel-Rahman Abdou"],"meta":["February 2015"],"references":["229316928_Mobile_Application_Market_A_Developer's_Perspective","224240923_Toward_a_Practical_Face_Recognition_System_Robust_Alignment_and_Illumination_by_Sparse_Representation","221266515_Built-in_face_recognition_for_smart_photo_sharing_in_mobile_devices","319770516_A_combined_corner_and_edge_detector","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points","275057952_SURF_Speeded_up_robust_features","265446703_An_Executive_Summary_of_Research_in_Android_Integrated_Development_Environments","260534857_Illumination-Robust_Face_Recognition_System_Based_on_Differential_Components","221303886_SURF_Speeded_Up_Robust_Features"]}
