{"id":"220585707_Approaches_for_Scaling_DBSCAN_Algorithm_to_Large_Spatial_Databases","abstract":"The huge amount of information stored in databases owned by corporations (e.g., retail, financial, telecom) has spurred a\ntremendous interest in the area of knowledge discovery and data mining. Clustering, in data mining, is a useful technique\nfor discovering interesting data distributions and patterns in the underlying data, and has many application fields, such\nas statistical data analysis, pattern recognition, image processing, and other business applications. Although researchers\nhave been working on clustering algorithms for decades, and a lot of algorithms for clustering have been developed, there\nis still no efficient algorithm for clustering very large databases and high dimensional data. As an outstanding representative\nof clustering algorithms, DBSCAN algorithm shows good performance in spatial data clustering. However, for large spatial databases,\nDBSCAN requires large volume of memory support and could incur substantial I/O costs because it operates directly on the entire\ndatabase. In this paper, several approaches are proposed to scale DBSCAN algorithm to large spatial databases. To begin with,\na fast DBSCAN algorithm is developed, which considerably speeds up the original DBSCAN algorithm. Then a sampling based DBSCAN\nalgorithm, a partitioning-based DBSCAN algorithm, and a parallel DBSCAN algorithm are introduced consecutively. Following\nthat, based on the above-proposed algorithms, a synthetic algorithm is also given. Finally, some experimental results are\ngiven to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these algorithms.","authors":["Aoying Zhou","Shuigeng Zhou","Jing Cao","Ye Fan"],"meta":["November 2000Journal of Computer Science and Technology 15(6):509-526","DOI:10.1007/BF02948834","SourceDBLP"],"references":["234739284_Random_Sampling_with_a_Reservoir","220695963_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_To_Cluster_Analysis","3296625_Data_mining_An_overview_from_a_database_perspective","2334693_Efficient_and_Effective_Clustering_Methods_for_Spatial_Data_Mining","344484944_Randomized_Algorithms","313708771_The_R-tree_An_efficient_and_robust_access_method_for_points_and_rectangles","312388900_STING_A_statistical_information_grid_approach_to_spatial_data_mining","304747650_Efficient_and_effective_clustering_methods_for_spatial_data_mining","277677773_BIRCH","272176868_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","242367092_The_r-tree_an_efficient_and_robust_method_for_points_and_rectangles","240157352_Automatic_Subspace_Clustering_of_High_Dimensional_Data_for_data_mining_applications","228057840_Randomized_Algorithms","223624491_CURE_An_efficient_clustering_algorithm_for_large_databases","221653977_A_Density-Based_Algorithm_for_Discovering_Clusters_in_Large_Spatial_Databases_with_Noise","221311096_STING_A_Statistical_Information_Grid_Approach_to_Spatial_Data_Mining","220072918_Data_Mining_An_Overview_from_a_Database_Perspective","33030362_The_R-Tree_An_Efficient_and_Robust_Access_Method_for_Points_and_Rectangles","2500574_BIRCH_An_Efficient_Data_Clustering_Method_for_Very_Large_Databases","2419875_WaveCluster_A_Multi-Resolution_Clustering_Approach_for_Very_Large_Spatial_Databases","2282585_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Large_Spatial_Databases_Focusing_Techniques_for_Efficient_Class_Identification"]}
