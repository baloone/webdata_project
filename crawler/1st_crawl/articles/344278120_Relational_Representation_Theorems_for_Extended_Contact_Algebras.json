{"id":"344278120_Relational_Representation_Theorems_for_Extended_Contact_Algebras","abstract":"In topological spaces, the relation of extended contact is a ternary relation that holds between regular closed subsets A, B and D if the intersection of A and B is included in D. The algebraic counterpart of this mereotopological relation is the notion of extended contact algebra which is a Boolean algebra extended with a ternary relation. In this paper, we are interested in the relational representation theory for extended contact algebras. In this respect, we study the correspondences between point-free and point-based models of space in terms of extended contact. More precisely, we prove new representation theorems for extended contact algebras.","authors":["Philippe Balbiani","Tatyana Ivanova"],"meta":["September 2020Studia Logica","DOI:10.1007/s11225-020-09923-0","Project: Space, Time and Modality: Relational, Algebraic and Topological Models"],"references":["330629401_Extended_Contact_Algebras_and_Internal_Connectedness","330422329_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","330422013_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_A_Proximity_Approach-I","322645201_A_mereotopology_based_on_sequent_algebras","302375836_Boolean_Algebras","292733545_Pointless_geometries","285350971_Point_line_and_surface_as_sets_of_solids","269008920_Chapter_18_Pointless_Geometries","267139632_Introduction_to_Boolean_Algebras","264826487_Spatial_reasoning_with_RCC8RCC8_and_connectedness_constraints_in_Euclidean_spaces"]}
