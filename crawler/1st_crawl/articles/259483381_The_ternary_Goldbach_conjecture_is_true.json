{"id":"259483381_The_ternary_Goldbach_conjecture_is_true","abstract":"The ternary Goldbach conjecture, or three-primes problem, asserts that every\nodd integer $n$ greater than $5$ is the sum of three primes. The present paper\nproves this conjecture.\nBoth the ternary Goldbach conjecture and the binary, or strong, Goldbach\nconjecture had their origin in an exchange of letters between Euler and\nGoldbach in 1742. We will follow an approach based on the circle method, the\nlarge sieve and exponential sums. Some ideas coming from Hardy, Littlewood and\nVinogradov are reinterpreted from a modern perspective. While all work here has\nto be explicit, the focus is on qualitative gains.\nThe improved estimates on exponential sums are proven in the author's papers\non major and minor arcs for Goldbach's problem. One of the highlights of the\npresent paper is an optimized large sieve for primes. Its ideas get reapplied\nto the circle method to give an improved estimate for the minor-arc integral.","authors":["H. A.
