{"id":"317934371_On_logical_notions_in_the_Fraenkel-Mostowski_cumulative_universe","abstract":"Fraenkel-Mostowski set theory represents a tool for managing infinite structures in terms of finite objects. In this paper we provide a connection between the concept of logical notions invariant under permutations introduced by Tarski and Fraenkel-Mostowski set theory. More precisely, we prove that some particular sets defined by using the axioms of Fraenkel-Mostowski set theory are logical notions in Tarski's sense. We also investigate whether a new and specific Fraenkel-Mostowski binding operator is logical in Tarski's sense.","authors":["Andrei Alexandru","Gabriel Ciobanu"],"meta":["January 2017Bulletin des Sciences Math√©matiques 60(2):113-125"],"references":[]}
