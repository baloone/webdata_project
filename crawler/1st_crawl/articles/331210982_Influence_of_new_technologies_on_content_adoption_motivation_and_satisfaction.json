{"id":"331210982_Influence_of_new_technologies_on_content_adoption_motivation_and_satisfaction","abstract":"The objective of the paper was to explore university teaching in the context of using new technologies that are nowadays ubiquitous, and to determine whether there is a correlation between new technologies and students’ satisfaction and motivation and whether new technologies affect the greater content adoption. The survey results show that students are more satisfied and motivated in classes where new technologies are used, while the experiment results show that students from both the control and experimental group scored equally in the test of knowledge, which differs from students’ attitudes about new technologies affecting greater content adoption. The paper represents a step forward from the traditional methods of research in pedagogy and didactics, where pedagogues and psychologists are the only ones using and researching motivation and satisfaction, as well as content adoption, while here the awareness of the importance of this subject shifted into other professions, which is extremely important in the Croatian context.","authors":["Snježana Dubovicki","Josip Balen"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":[]}
