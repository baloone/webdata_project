{"id":"335315368_Painting-Emotion_Matching_Technology_Learning_System_through_Repetition","abstract":"Peopleâ€™s interest in paintings has increased as artists have easier access to an audience. However, at times, laypersons may not understand the significance of a painting. With the development of computer science, it has become possible to analyze paintings using machines, but some limitations remain. In this paper, we present a learning tool to help analyze the sensitivity of a given painting. To this end, the proposed system provides users with the ability to predict the emotions expressed by a painting through repeated learning of a matched painting. Using this learning tool, users can improve their ability to understand paintings.","authors":["Taemin Lee","Sanghyun Seo"],"meta":["August 2019Sustainability 11(16):4507","DOI:10.3390/su11164507"],"references":["317746834_Photo_collage-based_photograph_display_system_on_mobile_computing_platform","316183153_Cognition_and_technology_for_instrumental_music_learning","316118020_A_method_for_extracting_emotion_using_colors_comprise_the_painting_image","281995171_Emotion_in_Painting_and_Art_Installations","317173742_Research_Themes_in_Technology_Enhanced_Learning","315472546_Music_synchronization_with_video_using_emotion_similarity","311097784_System_for_matching_paintings_with_music_based_on_emotions","296916226_Pixel-Based_Based_Impressionistic_Stylization","289777814_Photography_History_and_Theory","282399300_A_photomosaic_image_generation_method_using_photo_annotation_in_a_social_network_environment"]}
