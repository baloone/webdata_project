{"id":"2460430_Fast_Algorithms_for_Mining_Association_Rules","abstract":"We consider the problem of discovering association rules between items in a large database of sales transactions. We presenttwo new algorithms for solving this problem that are fundamentally different from the known algorithms. Experiments with synthetic as well as real-life data show that these algorithms outperform the known algorithms by factors ranging from three for small problems to more than an order of magnitude for large problems. We also showhow the best features of the two proposed algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database. 1 Introduction Database mining is motivated by the decision support problem faced by most large retail organizations [S + 93]. Progress in bar-code technology has made it possible for retail ...","authors":["Rakesh Agrawal","Ramakrishnan Srikant"],"meta":["August 2000"],"references":["307174918_Mining_association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","227287701_Mining_For_Knowledge_In_Databases_The_Inlen_Architecture_Initial_Implementation_And_First_Results","220344164_Knowledge_Acquisition_Via_Incremental_Conceptual_Clustering","2247895_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Databases","247219415_Practitioner_problems_in_need_of_database_research_Re-search_directions_in_knowledge_discovery","246668615_Learning_logical_de_nitions_from_examples","246619694_Knowledge_mining_in_databases_A_uni_ed_approach_through_conceptual_clustering","245941585_Discovery_from_databases_A_review_of_AI_and_statistical_techniques","242526049_Swami_efficient_similarity_search_in_sequence_databases","242494458_Scientific_Discovery_Computational_Explorations_of_the_Creative_Process","239566266_Bridging_the_gap_between_database_theory_and_practice","234409660_Domain-Independent_Scientific_Function_Finding","228396750_Discovery_Analysis_and_Presentation_of_Strong_Rules","228396697_Set-Oriented_Mining_for_Association_Rules","221345902_SKICAT_A_Machine_Learning_System_for_Automated_Cataloging_of_Large_Scale_Sky_Surveys","221344801_Megainduction_A_Test_Flight","221311299_Dependency_Inference","221310285_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Databases_An_Attribute-Oriented_Approach","220967626_Knowledge_Mining_by_Imprecise_Querying_A_Classification-Based_Approach","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","220344038_A_Bayesian_Method_for_the_Induction_of_Probabilistic_Networks_from_Data","220283231_Data_Dredging","216301244_Probabilistic_Reasoning_in_Intelligent_Systems_Networks_Of_Plausible_Inference","24289753_AutoClass_A_Bayesian_Classification_System","2720806_Efficient_Induction_Of_Logic_Programs","2599526_Database_Mining_A_Performance_Perspective","2579019_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Discovering_Association_Rules","2260730_Data_Mining_The_Search_for_Knowledge_in_Databases"]}
