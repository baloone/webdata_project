{"id":"261972198_An_On_Algorithm_for_the_QAP_Linearization_Problem","abstract":"An instance of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) with cost matrix Q is said to be linearizable if there exists an instance of the linear assignment problem (LAP) with cost matrix C such that for each assignment, the QAP and LAP objective function values are identical. Several sufficiency conditions are known that guarantee linearizability of a QAP. However, no polynomial time algorithm is known to test if a given instance of QAP is linearizable. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for an instance of a QAP to be linearizable and develop an O(n‚Å¥) algorithm to solve the corresponding linearization problem, where n is the size of the QAP.","authors":["Santosh N.
