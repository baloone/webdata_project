{"id":"332341383_Development_and_Validation_of_an_Instrument_to_Measure_Student_Perceived_E-Learning_Service_Quality","abstract":"While universities have been trying to focus their resources and attention on improving e-learning, many universities seem to be lagging behind students' increasing demands and expectations. In order to sustainably grow in an increasingly competitive e-learning environment, it is clear that universities must provide e-learning students with high quality services. To do this, universities are required to understand the attributes that e-learning students use to evaluate service quality. Unfortunately, little research on e-learning service quality has been conducted. This study developed and validated an instrument to measure student perceived e-learning service quality. Based on the relevant literature review and using responses from 1,232 e-learning students, the authors validated a three-factor e-learning service quality instrument involving e-learning system quality, e-learning instructor and course materials quality, and e-learning administrative and support service quality. Among these three factors, e-learning system quality makes the highest contribution to overall e-learning service quality, followed by e-learning instructor and course materials quality, and e-learning administrative and support service quality. This scale provides a useful measurement for researchers who wish to measure e-learning service quality and for university administrators and managers who want to enhance universities' e-learning servie quality.","authors":["Long Pham","Kioh Kim","Bruce Walker","Thomas DeNardin"],"meta":["April 2019International Journal of Enterprise Information Systems
