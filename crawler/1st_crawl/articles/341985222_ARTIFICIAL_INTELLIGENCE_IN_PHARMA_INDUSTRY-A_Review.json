{"id":"341985222_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_IN_PHARMA_INDUSTRY-A_Review","abstract":"Artificial intelligence use in pharmaceutical technology has increased over the years, and the use of technology can save time and money while providing a better understanding of the relationships between different formulations and processes parameters. Artificial intelligence is a branch of the computer science that deals with the problem-solving by the aid of symbolized programming. It has greatly evolved in to a science of problems-solving with the hug applications in business, health care, and engineering. The article is describes the drugs discovery ,tools of AI, manufacturing execution systems automated control processes systems ,AI to predict new treatment ,development of novel peptides from natural foods, treatment and management of rare diseases, drug adherence and dosage ,challenges to adoption of AI in pharma.
