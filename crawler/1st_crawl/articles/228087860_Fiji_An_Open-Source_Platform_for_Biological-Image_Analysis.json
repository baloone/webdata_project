{"id":"228087860_Fiji_An_Open-Source_Platform_for_Biological-Image_Analysis","abstract":"Fiji is a distribution of the popular open-source software ImageJ focused on biological-image analysis. Fiji uses modern software engineering practices to combine powerful software libraries with a broad range of scripting languages to enable rapid prototyping of image-processing algorithms. Fiji facilitates the transformation of new algorithms into ImageJ plugins that can be shared with end users through an integrated update system. We propose Fiji as a platform for productive collaboration between computer science and biology research communities.","authors":["Johannes Schindelin","Ignacio Arganda-Carreras","Erwin Frise","Verena Kaynig"],"meta":["June 2012Nature Methods 9(7):676-82","DOI:10.1038/nmeth.2019","SourcePubMed","Project: Fiji Is Just ImageJ"],"references":["293648038_Reconstruction_of_Zebrafish_Early_Embryonic_Development_by_Scanned_Light_Sheet_Microscopy","273590255_Basic_local_alignment_search_tool_BLAST","227858264_TrakEM2_Software_for_Neural_Circuit_Reconstruction","225296299_Elastic_volume_reconstruction_from_series_of_ultra-thin_microscopy_sections","313571641_Reusable_software_in_computer_vision","284653608_Snakes_Active_Contour_Models","228334776_Image_Processing_with_ImageJ","228083869_Snakes_Active_Contour_Models","224890800_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_an_update","222521233_Robust_Wide_Baseline_Stereo_from_Maximally_Stable_Extremal_Regions"]}
