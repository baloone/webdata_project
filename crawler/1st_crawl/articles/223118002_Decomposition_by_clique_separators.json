{"id":"223118002_Decomposition_by_clique_separators","abstract":"We consider the problem of decomposing a graph by means of clique separators, by which we mean finding cliques (complete graphs) whose removal disconnects the graph. We give an O(nm)-time algorithm for finding a decomposition of an n-vertex, m-edge graph. We describe how such a decomposition can be used in divide-and-conquer algorithms for various graph problems, such as graph coloring and finding maximum independent sets. We survey classes of graphs for which such divide-and-conquer algorithms are especially useful.","authors":["Robert Endre Tarjan"],"meta":["July 1985Discrete Mathematics 55(2):221-232","DOI:10.1016/0012-365X(85)90051-2","SourceDBLP"],"references":["245757347_Computing_the_Minimum_Fill-In_is_NP-Complete","267085934_Flows_in_Networks","265425295_A_graph-theoretic_study_of_the_numerical_solution_of_sparse_positive_definite_systems_of_linear_equations","246773956_Matching_and_a_polyhedron_with_O-1_vertices","245869868_Dept-first_search_and_linear_graph_algorithms","245248996_Algo-42_rithmic_aspects_of_vertex_elimination_on_graphs","243777916_Some_polynomial_algorithms_for_certain_graphs_and_hypergraphs","242789795_Algorithms_on_clique_separable_graphs","242530345_On_an_estimate_of_the_chromatic_class_of_a_p-graph_In_Russian","239667004_Minimal_triangulation_of_a_graph_and_optimal_pivoting_order_in_a_sparse_matrix1","239279283_A_theorem_on_coloring_the_lines_of_a_network","230596035_A_Separator_Theorem_for_Planar_Graphs","230595844_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","225125495_On_rigid_circuit_graphs","223640137_Edge_and_vertex_intersection_of_paths_in_a_tree","222597936_Triangulated_Graphs_and_the_Elimination_Process","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220618077_Algorithms_for_Minimum_Coloring_Maximum_Clique_Minimum_Covering_by_Cliques_and_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_a_Chordal_Graph","220617665_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Vertex_Elimination_on_Graphs","220617300_The_NP-Completeness_of_Edge-Coloring","220616517_Dividing_a_Graph_into_Triconnected_Components","220431996_Linear-Time_Computability_of_Combinatorial_Problems_on_Series-Parallel_Graphs","220430847_An_Optimal_Algorithm_to_Detect_a_Line_Graph_and_Output_Its_Root_Graph","220114925_An_Algorithm_for_Finding_Clique_Cut-Sets","220079157_Intersection_graphs_of_paths_in_a_tree","213894633_Depth-First_Search_and_Linear_Graph_Algorithms","38346920_Incidence_Matrices_and_Interval_Graphs"]}
