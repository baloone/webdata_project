{"id":"321199325_A_Survey_on_Multicasting_in_Software-Defined_Networking","abstract":"Existing surveys of research into Software-Defined Networking (SDN) make only minimal mention of multicasting. We present a survey of existing multicast routing protocols in IP multicast, and a survey of existing and proposed multicast routing algorithms in SDN multicast. Each of these protocols/algorithms is designed to optimize a slightly different metric, under specific constraints, so we contrast the approaches based on the optimization goal. We then present a survey of existing and proposed approaches to security for IP multicast and SDN multicast. This reveals a striking lack of breadth in the research in the topic of SDN multicast security.","authors":["Salekul Islam","Nasif Muslim","John William Atwood"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/COMST.2017.2776213"],"references":["321250277_SVC_Videoconferencing_Call_Adaptation_and_Bandwidth_Usage_in_SDN_Networks","305269361_A_video_conferencing_system_based_on_SDN-enabled_SVC_multicast","317340053_BloomFlow_OpenFlow_Extensions_for_Memory_Efficient_Scalable_Multicast_with_Multi-Stage_Bloom_Filters","316799473_Introduction_to_Network_Simulator_NS2","315489682_A_Framework_and_Comparative_Analysis_of_Control_Plane_Security_of_SDN_and_Conventional_Networks","313136089_Routing_of_multipoint_connections","310593166_Scalable_Multicasting_with_Multiple_Shared_Trees_in_Software_Defined_Networking","308840454_Efficient_multicast_algorithms_for_scalable_video_coding_in_software-defined_networking","308189698_SDNsec_Forwarding_Accountability_for_the_SDN_Data_Plane","305722392_Reliable_Multicast_Routing_for_Software-Defined_Networks"]}
