{"id":"301452785_The_Comparison_Study_of_Hierarchical_Routing_Protocols_for_Ad-Hoc_and_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Literature_Survey","abstract":"The hierarchical clustering is an efficient way to reduce the overall energy consumption within the cluster by performing aggregation and fusion of data. Clusters create hierarchical WSNs, which facilitate efficient utilization of limited resources of sensor nodes and thus extend network lifetime, reduce energy consumption of the system and provide overall system scalability. The proposed work of this paper is to provide an overview of hierarchical protocols and an overview of the protocol's performance. In this paper, we present the study of different clustering routing protocols of WSN and Ad-Hoc. The main focus of this paper is to give the comparison of different hierarchical routing protocols between WSNs and Ad-Hoc on various parameters.","authors":["Ouafaa Ibrihich","Jalal Laassiri","Krit Salah-ddine","El Hajji Said"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1145/2832987.2833039","Conference: the The International Conference","Project: Sensor Wireless Network Reliability"],"references":["268298978_Energy_Efficient_Clustering_Algorithms_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","318931442_Review_of_Hierarchical_Routing_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","312108843_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_microsensor_networks","310670788_Ad-hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","303943280_Hierarchical_geographic_multicast_routing_for_wireless_sensor_networks","291092261_Routing_Protocols_for_Ad-Hoc_Networks","285854667_Teen_Arouting_protocol_for_enhanced_efficiency_in_wireless_sensor_networks","285480574_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems","266147791_Clustering_in_sensor_networks_A_literature_survey","243773504_Royer_Ad-hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_routing"]}
