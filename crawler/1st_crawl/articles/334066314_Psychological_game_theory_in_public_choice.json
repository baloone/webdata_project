{"id":"334066314_Psychological_game_theory_in_public_choice","abstract":"We present the basic framework of psychological game theory (PGT) and linkages to the public choice literature.\nThe distinction between PGT and other game-theoretic frameworks rests on the inclusion of beliefs about strategies directly within the playersâ€™ objective functions.\nThus, a natural extension of PGT includes the consideration of non-monetary drivers of behavior. We provide examples of applications in public choice.","authors":["Gregory DeAngelo","Bryan C.
