{"id":"339285995_Clustering_a_2d_Pareto_Front_P-center_Problems_Are_Solvable_in_Polynomial_Time","abstract":"Having many non dominated solutions in bi-objective optimization problems, this paper aims to cluster the Pareto front using Euclidean distances. The p-center problems, both in the discrete and continuous versions, become solvable with a dynamic programming algorithm. Having N points, the complexity of clustering is (resp. ) time and O(N) memory space for the continuous (resp. discrete) K-center problem for , and in time for such 2-center problems. Furthermore, parallel implementations allow quasi-linear speed-up for the practical applications.","authors":["Nicolas Dupin","Frank Nielsen","El-Ghazali Talbi"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-41913-4_15","In book: Optimization and Learning, Third International Conference, OLA 2020, Cádiz, Spain, February 17–19, 2020, Proceedings (pp.179-191)","Project: Clustering algorithms in a 2d Pareto Front"],"references":["326552317_Dynamic_Programming_heuristic_for_k-means_Clustering_among_a_2-dimensional_Pareto_Frontier","318446116_Maximum_Volume_Subset_Selection_for_Anchored_Boxes","259231686_Ckmeans1ddp_Optimal_k-means_Clustering_in_One_Dimension_by_Dynamic_Programming","227414937_A_Clustering_Procedure_for_Reducing_the_Number_of_Representative_Solutions_in_the_Pareto_Front_of_Multiobjective_Optimization_Problems","220669055_A_New_Formulation_and_Resolution_Method_for_the_p-Center_Problem","220617424_New_results_on_the_complexity_of_p-center_problems","24013619_Computing_k-Centers_On_a_Line","333804328_K-Medoids_Clustering_Is_Solvable_in_Polynomial_Time_for_a_2d_Pareto_Front","312908300_Fast_Exact_k-Means_k-Medians_and_Bregman_Divergence_Clustering_in_1D","280765002_Measuring_the_quality_of_discrete_representations_of_efficient_sets_in_multiple_objective_mathematical_programming","279729680_Hypervolume_Subset_Selection_in_Two_Dimensions_Formulations_and_Algorithms","266656111_Two-dimensional_subset_selection_for_hypervolume_and_epsilon-indicator","257922215_Double_bound_method_for_solving_the_p-center_location_problem","245631584_The_Discrete_2Center_Problem","242598959_The_P-Centre_Problem-Heuristic_and_Optimal_Algorithms","232346486_Easy_and_Hard_Bottleneck_Location_Problems","226327855_The_Slab_Dividing_Approach_To_Solve_the_Euclidean_P-Center_Problem","226291061_A_Near-Linear_Algorithm_for_the_Planar_2-Center_Problem","220618158_On_the_Complexity_of_Some_Common_Geometric_Location_Problems","220617278_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_Linear_Programming_in_R","220113547_Optimal_Packing_and_Covering_in_the_Plane_are_NP-Complete","216457232_Investigating_and_Exploiting_the_Bias_of_the_Weighted_Hypervolume_to_Articulate_User_Preferences","200622136_Metaheuristics_From_Design_to_Implementation"]}
