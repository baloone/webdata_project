{"id":"350831891_Computing_Metric_Dimension_of_Power_of_Total_Graph","abstract":"For a connected graph G, the distance d(u,v) between any two vertices u, v ∈ V(G) is defined as; d(u, v) = minPu,v{length of Puv} i.e the minimum length of path connecting any two vertices. Two vertices u, v of a graph G are said to be resolved by a vertices W of a graph G if d(u,w) ≠ d(v,w). An ordered set W = {w1,w2,w3,...,wk} ∈ V(G) is resolving set for a connected graph G, if for any two vertices u, v there exists wi ∈ W such that d(u,wi) ≠ d(v,wi). The representation of vertices v w.r.t W is represented by r(v|W) which is k-vector(k-tuple) (d(v,w1),d(v,w2),d(v,w3),...,d(v,wk)). If the representation of all the vertices of graph G are different w.r.t W then W is the resolving set for G [1]. A resolving set that contains minimum numbers of vertices is metric basis for G. The cardinality of smallest resolving set is the metric dimension of G, represented by dim(G) [2], [3]. A family of connected graph G has unbounded metric dimension if dim(G) depends on order of a graph. In this paper, we show that total graph of cycle power three and four have unbounded metric dimension. We also proved some results on edges of power of cycle graph.","authors":["Sehar Nawaz","Murtaza Ali","Murad Ul Islam Khan","Mushtaq Ahmad Khan"],"meta":["April 2021IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3072554"],"references":["337110100_On_the_Families_of_Graphs_With_Unbounded_Metric_Dimension","316568673_The_metric_dimension_of_circulant_graphs_and_their_Cartesian_products","274300892_On_Metric_Dimension_of_Two_Constructed_Families_from_Antiprism_Graph","267474657_On_the_metric_dimension_of_Mobius_ladders","266983187_On_two_families_of_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","266061233_On_Cycle_Related_Graphs_with_Constant_Metric_Dimension","264553656_Families_of_regular_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","305952753_The_Metric_Dimension_of_Some_Kneser_Graphs","277774483_ON_PATH_RELATED_GRAPHS_WITH_CONSTANT_METRIC_DIMENSION","265367217_The_metric_dimension_of_unicyclic_graphs"]}
