{"id":"319501512_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks are built upon the convolution operation, which extracts informative features by fusing spatial and channel-wise information together within local receptive fields. In order to boost the representational power of a network, much existing work has shown the benefits of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on channels and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the \"Squeeze-and-Excitation\" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at slight computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, achieving a 25% relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.","authors":["Jie Hu","Li Shen","Gang Sun","Samuel Albanie"],"meta":["September 2017IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2913372"],"references":[]}
