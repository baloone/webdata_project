{"id":"226841474_A_Knowledge_Assimilation_Method_for_Logic_Data_Base","abstract":"In this paper we consider a deductive question-answering system for relational databases as a logic database system, and propose\na knowledge assimilation method suitable for such a system. The concept of knowledge assimilation for deductive logic is constructed\nin an implementable form based on the notion of amalgamating object language and metalanguage. This concept calls for checks\nto be conducted on four subconcepts, provability, contradiction, redundancy, independency, and their corresponding internal\ndatabase updates. We have implemented this logic database knowledge assimilation program in PROLOG, a logic programming language,\nand have found PROLOG suitable for knowledge assimilation implementation.","authors":["Taizo Miyachi","Susumu Kunifuji","Hajime Kitakami","Koichi Furukawa"],"meta":["December 1984New Generation Computing 2(4):385-404","DOI:10.1007/BF03037329","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221278188_Negation_as_Failure","220900223_Incorporating_Naive_Negation_into_Prolog","220430820_Horn_clauses_and_database_dependencies","200034217_Amalgamating_Language_and_Metalanguage_in_Logic_Programming","321557611_Advances_in_Data_Base_Theory_Volume_1","242536335_Advances_in_database_theory","238699780_Definite_clause_grammars_compared_with_augmented_transition_networks","225823549_On_semantic_issues_in_the_relational_model_of_data","221311052_A_Sophisticate's_Introduction_to_Database_Normalization_Theory","221278177_On_Closed_World_Data_Bases","221278174_Data_Base_Theory_vs_Interpretation","220976669_On_Semantic_Issues_in_the_Relational_Model_of_Data","29505979_Workshop_on_Logical_Bases_for_Data_Bases_v2"]}
