{"id":"220194035_Decomposing_a_planar_graph_with_girth_8_into_a_forest_and_a_matching","abstract":"W. He et al. showed that a planar graph of girth at least 11 can be decomposed into a forest and a matching. A. Bass et al. proved the same statement for planar graphs of girth at least 10. Recently, O.V. Borodin, A. V. Kostochka, N. N. Sheikh and G. Yu [Eur. J. Comb. 29, No. 5, 1235-1241 (2008; Zbl 1144.05019)] improved the bound on the girth to 9. In this paper, we further improve the bound on the girth to 8. This bound is the best possible in the sense that there are planar graphs with girth 7 that cannot be decomposed into a forest and a matching.","authors":["Yingqian Wang","Qijun Zhang"],"meta":["June 2011Discrete Mathematics 311(10-11):844-849","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2011.01.019","SourceDBLP"],"references":["263539288_Decomposition_of_Sparse_Graphs_into_Forests_and_a_Graph_with_Bounded_Degree","230281112_Partitioning_a_Planar_Graph_of_Girth_10_into_a_Forest_and_a_Matching","227724164_Edge-partitions_of_planar_graphs_and_their_game_coloring_numbers","223120730_Decomposing_a_planar_graph_with_girth_9_into_a_forest_and_a_matching"]}
