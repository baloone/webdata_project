{"id":"262412335_Using_Scrum_in_a_quarter-length_undergraduate_software_engineering_course","abstract":"In this paper, we describe the use of Scrum in an upper-division software engineering quarter-length course. We describe tools used to support both the use of Scrum and the overall objectives of an introductory course in software engineering. We do this to provide support for others who want to teach an introductory software engineering course in a format suitable for a course shorter than the typical semester-length course.","authors":["Linda Werner","Dominic Arcamone","Ben Ross"],"meta":["April 2012Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges 27(4):140-150"],"references":["303809631_Bloom's_taxonomy_for_CS_assessment","345885244_Between_Mind_and_Computer_Fuzzy_Science_and_Engineering","329025312_Reconfiguring_the_firewall_Recruiting_women_to_information_technology_across_cultures_and_continents","319394622_Introduction_to_Automata_Theory_Languages_and_Computation_2nd_Edition","318517973_Leaving_College_Rethinking_the_Causes_and_Cures_of_Student_Attrition","306199590_Research_and_practice_of_student_retention_What_next_Journal_of_College_Student_Retention_Research","303206149_Inside_the_double_bind_A_synthesis_of_empirical_research","290302540_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Research_on_Women's_Participation_in_Postsecondary_Computing_Education","288946274_Do_intervention_programs_assist_students_to_succeed_in_college_A_multilevel_longitudinal_study","286359207_Lost_in_Translation_Gender_and_High_School_Computer_Science"]}
