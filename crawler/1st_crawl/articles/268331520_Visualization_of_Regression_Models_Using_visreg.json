{"id":"268331520_Visualization_of_Regression_Models_Using_visreg","abstract":"Regression models allow us to isolate the relationship between the outcome and an explanatory variable while the other variables are held constant. Here, we introduce an R package, visreg, for the convenient visualization of this relationship via short, simple function calls. In addition to estimates of this relationship, the package also provides pointwise confidence bands and partial residuals to allow assessment of variability, outliers, and deviations from modeling assumptions. The package also provides several options for visualizing models with interactions, including lattice plots, contour plots, and both static and interactive perspective plots. The implementation of the package is designed to be as generic as possible, allowing visualization not only of linear models, but of generalized linear models (glm), proportional hazards models (coxph), generalized additive models (gam), robust regression models (rlm), and more.","authors":["Patrick Breheny","Woodrow Burchett"],"meta":["January 2014The R Journal 9(2)","DOI:10.32614/RJ-2017-046"],"references":["314751138_Plots_Transformations_and_Regression","308300968_Modern_Applied_Statistics_with_S","299822741_Generalized_Additive_Models_An_Introduction_With_R","288474536_A_Method_of_Handling_Curvilinear_Correlation_for_Any_Number_of_Variables","283410159_Stepwise_logistic_regression_Applied_logistic_regression","279710409_Local_likelihood_density_estimation","272475135_A_package_for_survival_analysis_R_package_237-2","267067160_Improved_Added_Variable_and_Partial_Residual_Plots_for_the_Detection_of_Influential_Observations_in_Generalized_Linear_Models","266266669_Regression_Diagnostics_Transformations_and_Constructed_Variables","266039368_Lattice_Multivariate_Data_Visualization_with_R","254332073_The_Use_of_Individual_Effects_and_Residuals_in_Fitting_Equations_to_Data","246339757_Graphical_Methods_for_Assessing_Logistic_Regression_Models","243529902_The_Use_of_Partial_Residual_Plots_in_Regression_Analysis","224817333_rgl_3D_visualization_device_system_OpenGL","200093046_In_Applied_Linear_Statistical_Models","38358722_Logistic_Regresson_Diagnostics"]}
