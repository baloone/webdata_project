{"id":"222834590_Handwritten_digit_recognition_Benchmarking_of_state-of-the-art_techniques","abstract":"This paper presents the results of handwritten digit recognition on well-known image databases using state-of-the-art feature extraction and classification techniques. The tested databases are CENPARMI, CEDAR, and MNIST. On the test data set of each database, 80 recognition accuracies are given by combining eight classifiers with ten feature vectors. The features include chaincode feature, gradient feature, profile structure feature, and peripheral direction contributivity. The gradient feature is extracted from either binary image or gray-scale image. The classifiers include the k-nearest neighbor classifier, three neural classifiers, a learning vector quantization classifier, a discriminative learning quadratic discriminant function (DLQDF) classifier, and two support vector classifiers (SVCs). All the classifiers and feature vectors give high recognition accuracies. Relatively, the chaincode feature and the gradient feature show advantage over other features, and the profile structure feature shows efficiency as a complementary feature. The SVC with RBF kernel (SVC-rbf) gives the highest accuracy in most cases but is extremely expensive in storage and computation. Among the non-SV classifiers, the polynomial classifier and DLQDF give the highest accuracies. The results of non-SV classifiers are competitive to the best ones previously reported on the same databases.","authors":["Cheng-Lin Liu","Kazuki Nakashima","Hiroshi Sako","Hiromichi Fujisawa"],"meta":["October 2003Pattern Recognition 36(10):2271-2285","DOI:10.1016/S0031-3203(03)00085-2","SourceDBLP","Project: Handwritten Character Recognition"],"references":["313557859_Pairwise_classification_and_support_vector_machines_In_Advances_in_kernel_methods_Support_vector_learning_Cambridge_MA","313173689_Comparison_of_learning_algorithms_for_handwritten_digit_recognition","304425264_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","292644622_Evaluation_and_synthesis_of_feature_vectors_for_handwritten_numeral_recognition","292001333_Handwritten_KANJI_and_HIRAGANA_character_recognition_using_weighted_direction_index_histogram_method","291876228_On_the_size_and_variable_transformation_of_feature_vector_for_handwritten_character_recognition","284772341_Pairwise_classification_and_support_vector_machines","284651281_Advances_in_Kernel_Methods","284645729_ISOLATED_HANDPRINTED_DIGIT_RECOGNITION","284204006_Handprinted_Kanji_characters_recognition_based_on_pattern_matching_method"]}
