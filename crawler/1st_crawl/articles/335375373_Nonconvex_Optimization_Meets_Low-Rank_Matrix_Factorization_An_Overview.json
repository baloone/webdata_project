{"id":"335375373_Nonconvex_Optimization_Meets_Low-Rank_Matrix_Factorization_An_Overview","abstract":"Substantial progress has been made recently on developing provably accurate and efficient algorithms for low- rank matrix factorization via nonconvex optimization. While conventional wisdom often takes a dim view of nonconvex optimization algorithms due to their susceptibility to spurious local minima, simple iterative methods such as gradient descent have been remarkably successful in practice. The theoretical footings, however, had been largely lacking until recently.","authors":["Yuejie Chi","Yue M.
