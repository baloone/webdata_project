{"id":"325127346_The_LALA_Project_Building_Capacity_to_Use_Learning_Analytics_to_Improve_Higher_Education_in_Latin_America","abstract":"Learning Analytics has been widely developed in European countries. Latin America is also starting to measure and optimize teaching and learning processes through Learning Analytics. However, the existing attempts in this direction are very isolated. Further efforts are needed in order to promote greater sharing of best practices between regions. Along these lines, the present work presents the LALA project with the aim of building capacity to use Learning Analytics to improve higher education in Latin America. At the end of the project we expect to have built local capacity for decision-making by using educational data, a community of practice around learning analytics, and a methodological framework to guide Latin American institutions to adopt tools to support learning.","authors":["Jorge Maldonado-Mahauad","Isabel Hilliger","Tinne De Laet","Martijn Millecamp"],"meta":["May 2018","Conference: Companion Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge (LAKâ€™18)At: Australia","Project: Building Capacity to Use Learning Analytics to Improve Higher Education in Latin America (LALA)"],"references":[]}
