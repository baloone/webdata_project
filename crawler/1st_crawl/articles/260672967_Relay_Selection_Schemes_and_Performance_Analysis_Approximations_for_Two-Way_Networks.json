{"id":"260672967_Relay_Selection_Schemes_and_Performance_Analysis_Approximations_for_Two-Way_Networks","abstract":"This paper studies relay selection schemes for two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks. For a network with two users that exchange information via multiple AF relays, we first consider a single-relay selection (SRS) scheme based on the maximization of the worse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the two end users. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the worse SNR of the two users and its approximations are obtained, based on which the block error rate (BLER), the diversity order, the outage probability, and the sum-rate of the two-way network are derived. Then, with the help of a relay ordering, a multiple-relay selection (MRS) scheme is developed. The training overhead and feedback requirement for the implementation of the relay selection schemes are discussed. Numerical and simulation results are provided to corroborate the analytical results.","authors":["Saman Atapattu","Yindi Jing","Hai Jiang","Chintha Tellambura"],"meta":["March 2013IEEE Transactions on Communications 61(3):987-998","DOI:10.1109/TCOMM.2012.010313.100669"],"references":["260511113_Performance_analysis_of_two-way_opportunistic_relaying_over_Nakagami-m_fading_channels","228340706_Spectral_Efficient_Signaling_for_Half-Duplex_Relay_Channels","226901142_Diversity_Analysis_of_Relay_Selection_Schemes_for_Two-Way_Wireless_Relay_Networks","224231395_On_the_Design_of_Network_Coding_for_Multiple_Two-Way_Relaying_Channels","311396077_User_cooperation_diversity_part_i_System_description","270260605_Table_of_Integrals_Series_and_Products_CD-ROM_Version_10","248183546_Two-way_Communication_Channels","225092415_Table_of_Integrals_Series_and_Products","224394839_Single_and_multiple_relay_selection_schemes_and_their_achievable_diversity_orders_IEEE_Transactions_on_Wireless_Communications_83_1414-1423","224223538_Relay_Selection_for_Two-Way_Relaying_With_Amplify-and-Forward_Protocols"]}
