{"id":"263587732_Heuristic_Search_Methods_A_Review","abstract":"Recent years have seen a burgeoning interest in heuristic search methods for complex optimization problems. Although the operational research (OR) community has had much to do with this, the interest in heuristics has spread much wider. The impetus for recent developments has come from researchers with a wide variety of backgroundsâ€”some in computer science and engineering, some in the 'traditional' sciences such as physics and biology, others in artificial intelligence and behavioural science. As a result of this large volume of work, there will be many develop-ments of which researchers and practitioners of operational research may not be aware. In the scope of a paper such as this, it is not possible to provide an exhaustive survey, but an attempt will be made to highlight some of the areas of likely interest to OR people who are interested in new ways of solving problems of ever-increasing complexity.","authors":["Colin Richard Reeves"],"meta":["January 1996","Conference: OR38 (Operational Research Society, Birmingham, UK)Volume: D.Johnson and F.O'Brien (1996) Operational Research: Keynote Papers 1996, pages 122-149."],"references":["313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","304342759_Simulated_annealing","303170286_Computer_solutions_of_the_traveling_salesman_problem","287661759_An_effective_heuristic_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","284051512_Improving_Search_in_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Genetic_Algorithms_and_Simulated_Annealing","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","265453391_The_traveling_salesman_problem_Bibliography","260453705_Simulated_Annealing_Theory_and_Applications","248040631_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_Computational_Solutions_for_TSP_Applications"]}
