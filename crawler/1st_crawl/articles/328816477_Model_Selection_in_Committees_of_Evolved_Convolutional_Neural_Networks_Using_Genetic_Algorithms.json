{"id":"328816477_Model_Selection_in_Committees_of_Evolved_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Using_Genetic_Algorithms","abstract":"Neuroevolution is a technique that has been successfully applied for over three decades in order to optimize certain aspects of neural networks by applying evolutionary algorithms. However, only in the recent years, the increase of computational resources has enabled to apply such techniques to deep and convolutional neural networks, where the number of hyperparameters is significantly large.","authors":["Alejandro Baldominos","Yago Sáez","Pedro Isasi"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-03493-1_39","In book: Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning – IDEAL 2018 (pp.364-373)Chapter: Lecture Notes in Computer Science 11314Publisher: Springer Nature","Project: Automatic design of deep neural networks"],"references":["326857696_An_Extensive_Survey_on_Some_Deep_Learning_Applications","324694064_Evolutionary_Design_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Human_Activity_Recognition_in_Sensor-Rich_Environments","322895764_Deep_Learning_for_Computer_Vision_A_Brief_Review","318140943_A_Large-Scale_CNN_Ensemble_for_Medication_Safety_Analysis","326099136_A_survey_on_deep_learning_for_big_data","322694910_Deep_Learning_for_Sentiment_Analysis_A_Survey","322079459_Evolutionary_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_an_Application_to_Handwriting_Recognition","322060630_Genetic_CNN","318375026_Large_scale_evolution_of_convolutional_neural_networks_using_volunteer_computing","318071861_A_genetic_programming_approach_to_designing_convolutional_neural_network_architectures"]}
