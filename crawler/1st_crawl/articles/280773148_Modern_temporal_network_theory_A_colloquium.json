{"id":"280773148_Modern_temporal_network_theory_A_colloquium","abstract":"The power of any kind of network approach lies in the ability to simplify a\ncomplex system so that one can better understand its function as a whole.\nSometimes it is beneficial, however, to include more information than in a\nsimple graph of only nodes and links. Adding information about times of\ninteractions can make predictions and mechanistic understanding more accurate.\nThe drawback, however, is that there are not so many methods available, partly\nbecause temporal networks is a relatively young field, partly because it more\ndifficult to develop such methods compared to for static networks. In this\ncolloquium, we review the methods to analyze and model temporal networks and\nprocesses taking place on them, focusing mainly on the last three years. This\nincludes the spreading of infectious disease, opinions, rumors, in social\nnetworks; information packets in computer networks; various types of signaling\nin biology, and more. We also discuss future directions.","authors":["Petter Holme"],"meta":["August 2015The European Physical Journal B 88(9)","DOI:10.1140/epjb/e2015-60657-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304000701_Exploring_the_structure_and_function_of_temporal_networks_with_dynamic_graphlets","301728601_Spectral_centrality_measures_in_temporal_networks","300888432_An_Empirical_Analysis_on_Temporal_Pattern_of_Credit_Card_Trade","300581399_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_in_Temporal_Graphs","288486466_Temporal_random_walk_as_a_lightweight_communication_infrastructure_for_opportunistic_networks","287321055_Spreading_Dynamics_Following_Bursty_Activity_Patterns","283413427_Time-varying_Social_Networks_in_a_Graph_Database_A_Neo4J_Use_Case_in_First_International_Workshop_on_Graph_Data_Management_Experiences_and_Systems_GRADES_'13_ACM_New_York","281084317_Imperfect_diffusion_on_temporal_networks","280589899_On_the_Digital_Daily_Cycles_of_Individuals","280057974_Evaluation_of_farm-level_parameters_derived_from_animal_movements_for_use_in_risk-based_surveillance_programmes_of_cattle_in_Switzerland","279877086_Memory_and_burstiness_in_dynamic_networks","279864378_Eigenvector-Based_Centrality_Measures_for_Temporal_Networks","279180853_Identification_of_Patient_Zero_in_Static_and_Temporal_Networks_Robustness_and_Limitations","278047608_Diffusion_on_networked_systems_is_a_question_of_time_or_structure","344073649_Self-Organization_in_Complex_Ecosystems_MPB-42","328248593_Burstiness_and_spreading_on_temporal_networks","321246119_A_simple_model_of_global_cascades_on_random_networks","309905307_Finding_spread_blockers_in_dynamic_networks","308839314_Analysis_of_hop_limit_in_opportunistic_networks_by_static_and_time-aggregated_graphs","306017005_A_unifying_model_for_representing_time-varying_graphs","305350985_Understanding_Large_Temporal_Networks_and_Spatial_Networks_Exploration_Pattern_Searching_Visualization_and_Network_Evolution","302248943_Traveling_salesman_problems_in_temporal_graphs","302223913_Spatio-temporal_Networks_An_Introduction","301233236_Clustering_and_preferential_attachment_in_growing_networks","289209760_Infering_and_Calibrating_Triadic_Closure_in_a_Dynamic_Network","288616244_Temporal_Motifs","288130817_Dynamic_Communicability_Predicts_Infectiousness","287589225_Temporal_Scale_of_Dynamic_Networks","287311074_Burstiness_Measures_Models_and_Dynamic_Consequences","287240315_Self-organization_in_complex_ecosystems","285755642_Contrasting_Effects_of_Strong_Ties_on_SIR_and_SIS_Processes_in_Temporal_Networks","285636646_A_Dynamical_Network_View_of_Lyon's_Velo'v_Shared_Bicycle_System","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","283245924_Applying_temporal_network_analysis_to_the_venture_capital_market","282925789_Selecting_Seed_Nodes_for_Influence_Maximization_in_Dynamic_Networks","282734474_On_the_use_of_intrinsic_time_scale_for_dynamic_community_detection_and_visualization_in_social_networks","282356600_Exploiting_the_time-dynamics_of_news_diffusion_on_the_Internet_through_a_generalized_Susceptible-Infected_model","281976939_Dynamics_of_history-dependent_epidemics_in_temporal_networks","280773491_Exploring_Temporal_Networks_with_Greedy_Walks","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","280538731_Stability_of_Spreading_Processes_over_Time-Varying_Large-Scale_Networks","280255090_Social_Network_Analysis_in_Behavioral_Ecology","279864435_Temporal_Fidelity_in_Dynamic_Social_Networks","279310683_Coverage_centralities_for_temporal_networks","279310245_Statistical_clustering_of_temporal_networks_through_a_dynamic_stochastic_block_model","278717421_Applying_Landscape_Ecology_in_Biological_Conservation","278711672_Applying_Landscape_Ecology_in_Biological_Conservation","278627585_Computing_shortest_fastest_and_foremost_journeys_in_dynamic_networks","278413290_The_fundamental_structures_of_dynamic_social_networks","278042314_The_role_of_heterogeneity_in_contact_timing_and_duration_in_network_models_of_influenza_spread_in_schools","277603452_Spatio-Temporal_Complex_Networks_Reachability_Centrality_and_Robustness","277603308_From_calls_to_communities_a_model_for_time_varying_social_networks","277921146_Characterizing_Bursts_of_Aggregate_Pairs_With_Individual_Poissonian_Activity_and_Preferential_Mobility","277611654_Sciences_in_the_Song_and_Yuan_Dynasties_II"]}
