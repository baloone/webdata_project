{"id":"272576446_Emergent_Chance_how_objective_chance_and_determinism_are_compatible","abstract":"This article offers a new argument for the claim that there can be nondegenerate objective chance in a deterministic world. Using a formal model of the relationship between different levels of description of a system, the article shows how objective chance at a higher level can coexist with its absence at a lower level. Unlike previous arguments for the level-specificity of chance, the present argument shows, in a precise sense, that higher-level chance does not collapse into epistemic probability, despite higher-level properties supervening on lower-level ones. The article demonstrates that the distinction between objective chance and epistemic probability can be drawn, and operationalized, at every level of description. There is, therefore, not a single distinction between objective and epistemic probability but a family of such distinctions.\nPreprint available at: http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/61063/","authors":["Christian List","Marcus Pivato"],"meta":["January 2015Philosophical Review 124(1):119-152","DOI:10.1215/00318108-2812670"],"references":["280291996_Deterministic_Chance","265617090_The_Nature_of_Computation","259438129_Methodological_Individualism_and_Holism_in_Political_Science_A_Reconciliation","290864931_Probability_in_Deterministic_Physics","289934041_Probability_out_of_Determinism","288968266_Conditional_probability_is_the_very_guide_of_life","288846488_Deterministic_chaos_and_the_nature_of_chance","275697437_Causality_Models_Reasoning_and_Inference","265352649_Causality_Models_reasoning_and_inference_second_edition","261824004_Robust_Nonreductive_Materialism","258162485_The_Best_Humean_System_for_Statistical_Mechanics","257409968_Are_Deterministic_Descriptions_And_Indeterministic_Descriptions_Observationally_Equivalent","255583210_What_Conditional_Probability_Could_Not_Be","255578429_Monism_The_Priority_of_the_Whole","247935280_Quantum_Theory_and_the_Schism_in_Physics"]}
