{"id":"261498514_Derivative_based_control_for_LTV_system_with_unknown_parameters","abstract":"This paper deals with the robust stabilization of a class of linear time varying systems. Instead of using a state observer or having dynamic structure, the controller is based on output derivative estimation. This allows the stabilization of linear time varying systems with very large parameter variation and a small number of controller parameters. The proof of stability is based on the polytopic representation of the closed loop and Lyapunov conditions. The result is proposed in a LinearMatrix Inequality (LMI) form. The validity of this approach is illustrated by a second order system case of study.","authors":["Sonia Maalej","Alexandre Kruszewki","Lotfi Belkoura"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.23919/ECC.2013.6669730","Conference: Control Conference (ECC), 2013 European"],"references":["29637417_Etude_preliminaire_d'une_commande_sans_modele_pour_papillon_de_moteur_A_model-free_control_for_an_engine_throttle_a_preliminary_study","3483437_Observing_the_State_of_a_Linear_System","251943089_Terminal_sliding_mode_observer_based_parameter_estimation_method_for_permanent_magnet_synchronous_motor_control_system","246939376_New_results_in_linear_prediction_filtering_theory_Trans_AMSE_J","245495455_Parameter_estimation_for_signals_described_by_differential_equations","232912827_Sliding_Controller_Design_for_Nonlinear_Systems","224220614_Robust_Sliding_Mode_Observer_with_Parameters_Estimation_for_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Time-Delay_Systems","220157909_Gain-scheduled_output-feedback_controllers_depending_solely_on_scheduling_parameters_via_parameter-dependent_Lyapunov_function","220045336_Linear_Matrix_Inequalities_in_System_and_Control_Theory","31187610_Robust_adaptive_sliding-mode_control_for_continuous_time-delay_systems"]}
