By using a smart clothes based on textronics sensors and modern methods of processing and data transmission the system allows one to carry out remote monitoring of the health condition of small children in both the hospital and home conditions. In addition, the modular design of the system ensures the ease of use and reasonable production cost for each item.","authors":["Adam Jakubas"],"meta":["December 2015Przeglad Elektrotechniczny 1(12):123-126","DOI:10.15199/48.2015.12.30"],"references":["276037203_Preliminary_Investigations_into_the_Development_of_Textile_Based_Temperature_Sensor_for_Healthcare_Applications"]}
