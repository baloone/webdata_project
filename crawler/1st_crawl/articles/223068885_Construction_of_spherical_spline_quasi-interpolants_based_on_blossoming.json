{"id":"223068885_Construction_of_spherical_spline_quasi-interpolants_based_on_blossoming","abstract":"A general theory of quasi-interpolants based on quadratic spherical Powell–Sabin splines on spherical triangulations of a sphere-like surface S is developed by using polar forms. As application, various families of discrete and differential quasi-interpolants reproducing quadratic spherical Bézier–Bernstein polynomials or the whole space of the spherical Powell–Sabin quadratic splines of class C1 are presented.","authors":["María José Ibáñez","Abdellah Lamnii","H.
