{"id":"223288892_An_Interface_Capturing_Method_for_Free-Surface_Hydrodynamic_Flows","abstract":"An interface capturing method based on a numerically revisited procedure for velocity and pressure coupling is worked out. The new treatment of density discontinuity is formulated in the framework of the finite volume methodology for arbitrary unstructured grids. A simple analytical pressure-like model case is presented to illustrate the accuracy of the numerical implementation of the treatment of discontinuous variables. Then, the method is implemented in a viscous flow solver and applied to free-surface flows, including the two-dimensional Rayleighâ€“Taylor instability problem and three-dimensional hydrodynamic flows for the prediction of ship waves around the Series 60 model ship with and without drift angles. These latter simulations show excellent agreement with the experimental results illustrated by comparisons of free-surface elevations and also velocity field.","authors":["Patrick Queutey","Michel Visonneau"],"meta":["November 2007Computers & Fluids 36(9):1481-1510","DOI:10.1016/j.compfluid.2006.11.007"],"references":["281385390_Assessment_of_turbulence_models_for_ship_flow_at_full_scale","267187154_Numerical_Solution_of_the_Navier-Stokes_Equations","313198925_Computation_of_free_surface_flows_using_interface-tracking_and_interface-capturing_methods","312341649_A_non-oscillatory_Eulerian_approach_to_interfaces_in_multimaterial_flows_the_ghost_fluid_method","303076834_Numerical_solution_of_the_Navier-Stokes_equation","284607191_A_numerical_study_of_the_turbulent_flow_past_an_isolated_airfoil_with_trailing_edge_separation","281385485_Viscous_free_surface_flow_past_a_ship_in_drift_and_in_rotating_motion","280959960_Incompressible_Flow_Calculations_with_a_Consistent_Physical_Interpolation_using_the_CPI_Method","280856072_Comparison_of_explicit_algebric_stress_models_and_second-order_turbulence_closures_for_steady_flows_around_ships","258996718_Bounded_convection_schemes_for_unstructured_grids"]}
