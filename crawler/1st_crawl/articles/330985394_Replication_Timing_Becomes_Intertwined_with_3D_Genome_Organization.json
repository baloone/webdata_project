{"id":"330985394_Replication_Timing_Becomes_Intertwined_with_3D_Genome_Organization","abstract":"Through dissecting the link between spatial genome organization and DNA replication timing, Sima et al. (2019) discover early replicating control elements (ERCEs), a new type of cis-acting elements that regulate replication timing, transcription, and multiple layers of three-dimensional features of genome organization. The study has important implications for unraveling control elements of high-order genome structure and function.","authors":["Jian Ma","Zhijun Duan"],"meta":["February 2019Cell 176(4):681-684","DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.027"],"references":["325898122_Continuous-Trait_Probabilistic_Model_for_Comparing_Multi-species_Functional_Genomic_Data","320196138_Two_independent_modes_of_chromatin_organization_revealed_by_cohesin_removal","268788340_Topologically-associating_domains_are_stable_units_of_replication-timing_regulation","223976608_Spatial_partitioning_of_the_regulatory_landscape_of_the_X-inactivation_centre","223976604_Topological_Domains_in_Mammalian_Genomes_Identified_by_Analysis_of_Chromatin_Interactions","26881749_Comprehensive_Mapping_of_Long-Range_Interactions_Reveals_Folding_Principles_of_the_Human_Genome","330971287_Designer_Assays_for_Your_Sick_Subdivided_Heart","329954583_Identifying_cis_Elements_for_Spatiotemporal_Control_of_Mammalian_DNA_Replication","320329123_Cohesin_Loss_Eliminates_All_Loop_Domains","317079306_Targeted_Degradation_of_CTCF_Decouples_Local_Insulation_of_Chromosome_Domains_from_Genomic_Compartmentalization","9730260_Asynchronous_Duplication_of_Chromosomes_in_Cultured_Cells_of_Chinese_Hamster"]}
