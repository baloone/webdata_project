{"id":"301720430_Oscillatory_Brain_Dynamics_during_Sentence_Reading_A_Fixation-Related_Spectral_Perturbation_Analysis","abstract":"The present study investigated oscillatory brain dynamics during self-paced sentence-level processing. Participants read fully correct sentences, sentences containing a semantic violation and “sentences” in which the order of the words was randomized. At the target word level, fixations on semantically unrelated words elicited a lower-beta band (13–18 Hz) desynchronization. At the sentence level, gamma power (31–55 Hz) increased linearly for syntactically correct sentences, but not when the order of the words was randomized. In the 300–900 ms time window after sentence onsets, theta power (4–7 Hz) was greater for syntactically correct sentences as compared to sentences where no syntactic structure was preserved (random words condition). We interpret our results as conforming with a recently formulated predictive-coding framework for oscillatory neural dynamics during sentence-level language comprehension. Additionally, we discuss how our results relate to previous findings with serial visual presentation vs. self-paced reading.","authors":["Lorenzo Vignali","Nicole Alexandra Himmelstoß","Stefan Hawelka","Fabio Richlan"],"meta":["April 2016Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 10","DOI:10.3389/fnhum.2016.00191","Project: Word recognition in natural reading with parafoveal preview"],"references":["312854561_EEGLAB_an_open_source_toolbox_for_analysis_of_single-trial_EEG_dynamics","280622158_Eyes_on_words_A_fixation-related_fMRI_study_of_the_left_occipito-_temporal_cortex_during_self-_paced_silent_reading_of_words_and_pseudowords","276360179_Predictions_of_Visual_Content_across_Eye_Movements_and_Their_Modulation_by_Inferred_Information","272174770_On_forward_inferences_of_fast_and_slow_readers_An_eye_movement_study","271939187_Rethinking_parafoveal_processing_in_reading_Serial-attention_models_can_explain_semantic_preview_benefit_and_N_2_preview_effects","290998155_ez_Easy_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Factorial_Experiments","288913510_Top-down_processing_mediated_by_interareal_synchronization","280613538_Frontal-posterior_theta_oscillations_reflect_memory_retrieval_during_sentence_comprehension","273706108_A_predictive_coding_framework_for_rapid_neural_dynamics_during_sentence-level_language_comprehension","272029044_Fast_oscillatory_dynamics_during_language_comprehension_Unification_versus_maintenance_and_prediction"]}
