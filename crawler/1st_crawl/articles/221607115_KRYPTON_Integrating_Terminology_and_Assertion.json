{"id":"221607115_KRYPTON_Integrating_Terminology_and_Assertion","abstract":"The demands placed on a knowledge representation scheme by a knowl- edge-based system are generally not all met by any of today's can- didates. Representation languages based on frames or semantic net- works have intuitive appeal for forming descriptions but tend to have severely limited assertional power, and are often fraught with am- biguous readings. Those based on first-order logic are less limited assertionally, but are restricted to primitive, unrelated terms. We have attempted to overcome these limitations in a new, hybrid knowledge representation system, called \"KRYPTON\". KRYPTON has two rep- resentation languages, a frame-based one for forming domain-specific descriptive terms and a logic-based one for making statements about the world. We here summarize the two languages, a functional inter- face to the system, and an implementation in terms of a taxonomy of frames and its interaction with a first-order theorem prover.","authors":["Ronald J.
