{"id":"312023559_Some_Computational_Aspects_of_Boron_Triangular_Nanotubes","abstract":"The recent discovery of boron triangular nanotubes competes with carbon in many\nrespects. The closed form of M‐polynomial of nanotubes produces closed forms of many\ndegree‐based topological indices which are numerical parameters of the structure and, in\ncombination, determine properties of the concerned nanotubes. In this report, we give\nM‐polynomials of boron triangular nanotubes and recover many important topological\ndegree‐based indices of these nanotubes. We also plot surfaces associated with these nanotubes\nthat show the dependence of each topological index on the parameters of the structure.","authors":["Mobeen Munir","Waqas Nazeer","Shazia RAFIQUE","Abdul Rauf Nizami"],"meta":["January 2017Symmetry 9(6)","DOI:10.3390/sym9010006"],"references":["311972061_Some_Algebraic_Polynomials_and_Topological_Indices_of_Generalized_Prism_and_Toroidal_Polyhex_Networks","310606373_Some_Invariants_of_Circulant_Graphs","280136936_The_Zagreb_Indices_30_Years_After","297477116_The_first_Zagreb_indices_30_years_after","285380950_Some_properties_of_the_Wiener_polynomial","284041589_An_updated_survey_on_the_Randic_index","283868817_Valence_connectivity_versus_Randic_Zagreb_and_modified_Zagreb_index_A_linear_algorithm_to_check_discriminative_properties_of_indices_in_acyclic_molecular_graphs","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","268670797_Recent_Results_in_the_Theory_of_Randic_Index","267081398_On_history_of_the_Randic_index_and_emerging_hostility_toward_chemical_graph_theory"]}
