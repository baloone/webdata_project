This study will focus on a comprehensive literature review of quantitative disciplines in business and related areas. Which pedagogies are the same and which are different based on discipline? Practices, tools and approaches that are used and deemed effective in online learning will be overviewed and analyzed across disciplines in this exploratory research. The top rated skills and competencies for each quantitative discipline will be reviewed and summarized for similarities and differences. From this preliminary research, specific research proposals will be recommended for future research on quantitative discipline-specific best practices in the blended/online delivery of such courses. \n\n(PDF) Student Performance and Critical Thinking Skills: Online Discussion Boards in a Computer Science Operating Systems Course.
