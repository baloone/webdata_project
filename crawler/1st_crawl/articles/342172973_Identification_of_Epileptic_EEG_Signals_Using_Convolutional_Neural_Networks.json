{"id":"342172973_Identification_of_Epileptic_EEG_Signals_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Epilepsy is one of the chronic neurological disorders that is characterized by a sudden burst of excess electricity in the brain. This abnormality appears as a seizure, the detection of which is an important research topic. An important tool used to study brain activity features, neurological disorders and particularly epileptic seizures, is known as electroencephalography (EEG). The visual inspection of epileptic abnormalities in EEG signals by neurologists is time-consuming. Different scientific approaches have been used to accurately detect epileptic seizures from EEG signals, and most of those approaches have obtained good performance. In this study, deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was considered to increase the performance of the identification system of epileptic seizures. We applied a cross-validation technique in the design phase of the system. For efficiency, comparative results between other machine-learning approaches and deep CNNs have been obtained. The experiments were performed using standard datasets. The results obtained indicate the efficiency of using CNN in the detection of epilepsy.","authors":["Rahib Abiyev","Murat Arslan","John Bush Idoko","Boran Sekeroglu"],"meta":["June 2020Applied Sciences 10(12):4089","DOI:10.3390/app10124089"],"references":["332179653_Head_mouse_control_system_for_people_with_disabilities","327867065_Automatic_classification_of_refrigerator_using_doubly_convolutional_neural_network_with_jointly_optimized_classification_loss_and_similarity_loss","326762237_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Chest_Diseases_Detection","339488882_Classification_of_epileptic_EEG_signals_using_PSO_based_artificial_neural_network_and_tunable-Q_wavelet_transform","338798273_Stacking_ensemble_based_deep_neural_networks_modeling_for_effective_epileptic_seizure_detection","337725077_Epilepsy_seizure_detection_using_complete_ensemble_empirical_mode_decomposition_with_adaptive_noise","336987360_Auto-detection_of_Epileptic_Seizure_events_using_deep_neural_network_with_different_feature_scaling_techniques","333014984_Epileptic_seizure_identification_using_entropy_of_FBSE_based_EEG_rhythms","329953394_Detection_of_Seizure_Event_and_Its_OnsetOffset_Using_Orthonormal_Triadic_Wavelet_Based_Features","329161176_Adaptive_multi-parent_crossover_GA_for_feature_optimization_in_epileptic_seizure_identification"]}
