The tunneling barrier is defined by a compact solution of the electrostatics and is approximated by an area equivalent triangular profile. For this profile the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation (WKB) is applied. Referring to the area instead of the electric field at single points is shown to be more robust regarding numerical stability. By comparing the results of the approach with numerical TCAD Sentaurus simulation data of a double-gate (DG) TFET for various bias conditions and geometric positions within the device, the numerical stability as well as the limitations are demonstrated. Furthermore, the comparison to a quasi-2D WKB approach, the derived model shows a better fit to TCAD data at a reduced complexity.","authors":["Fabian Horst","Atieh Parokhnejad","Benjamin Iniguez","Alexander Kloes"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.23919/MIXDES.2018.8436770","Conference: 2018 25th International Conference \"Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and System\" (MIXDES)At: Gdynia, Poland","Project: Compact Modeling and Device Physics of TFETs, Junctionless FETs, TriGate FETs, Organic FETs, Neuromorphic, etc."],"references":["230667746_Complex_2D_electric_field_solution_in_undoped_double-gate_MOSFETs","228723526_Low-Voltage_Tunnel_Transistors_for_Beyond_CMOS_Logic","318259840_Static_noise_margin_analysis_of_8T_TFET_SRAM_cells_using_a_2D_compact_model_adapted_to_measurement_data_of_fabricated_TFET_devices","309343115_Implementation_of_a_DC_compact_model_for_double-gate_Tunnel-FET_based_on_2D_calculations_and_application_in_circuit_simulation","271417181_Improved_analytical_potential_modeling_in_double-gate_tunnel-FETs","262806173_A_2D_closed_form_model_for_the_electrostatics_in_hetero-junction_double-gate_tunnel-FETs_for_calculation_of_band-to-band_tunneling_current","230660702_Simulation_of_Tunneling_in_Semiconductor_Devices","230660692_Tunneling_in_Solids","224410254_Tunneling_in_a_finite_superlattice"]}
