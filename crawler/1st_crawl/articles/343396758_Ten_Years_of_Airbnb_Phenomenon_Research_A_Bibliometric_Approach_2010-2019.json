{"id":"343396758_Ten_Years_of_Airbnb_Phenomenon_Research_A_Bibliometric_Approach_2010-2019","abstract":"The interest in the Airbnb phenomenon is represented in the fast growth of publications indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) since the research inception of this topic in 2010. However, there are no studies that analyze the incidence of this phenomenon from a bibliometric approach using WoS. Therefore, this paper aims to quantify the incidence and composition of the Airbnb phenomenon through bibliometrics taken it as a data source. To achieve this aim, the WoS statistical instruments and the bibliometric tool VOSviewer are used. The results obtained, such as the number of articles and citations per year, the main categories of these articles, the nationalities of the authors, the most productive institutions, the sources and authors in terms of publications, and the H-Core of the most cited articles, are presented. Finally, concept maps are exposed, representing the relatedness of co-authorship and co-citation among authors, as well as the co-occurrence of the keywords in the articles analyzed. Satisfaction, trust, and innovation appear as the main research lines. This paper can be useful for academics and professionals, giving them a holistic overview of the topic, identifying new research areas, or as an objective manner to literary review approaches.","authors":["Julia Margarita Núñez-Tabales","Miguel Angel Solano Sanchez","Lorena Caridad López del Río"],"meta":["August 2020Sustainability 12(15):6205","DOI:10.3390/su12156205"],"references":["331283817_Impact_of_Airbnb_on_Customers'_Behavior_In_the_UK_Hotel_Industry","326520364_Sustainable_Tourism_Research_Towards_Twenty-Five_Years_of_the_Journal_of_Sustainable_Tourism","325092592_Sustainable_Tourism_in_Sensitive_Areas_Bibliometric_Characterisation_and_Content_Analysis_of_Specialised_Literature","331837467_Leading_Universities_in_Tourism_and_Hospitality_Research_A_Bibliometric_Overview","329516482_A_bibliometric_research_in_the_tourism_leisure_and_hospitality_fields","328485539_What_is_happening_in_Paris_Airbnb_hotels_and_the_Parisian_market_A_case_study","326433932_Twenty_five_years_of_the_Journal_of_Travel_Tourism_Marketing_a_bibliometric_ranking","325760427_Sustainability_in_the_collaborative_economy_A_bibliometric_analysis_reveals_emerging_interest","325255005_Research_impact_benchmarks_for_tourism_hospitality_and_events_scholars_in_Australia_and_New_Zealand","324808508_What_do_Airbnb_users_care_about_An_analysis_of_online_review_comments"]}
