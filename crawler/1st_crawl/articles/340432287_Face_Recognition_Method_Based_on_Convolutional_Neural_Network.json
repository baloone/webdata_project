{"id":"340432287_Face_Recognition_Method_Based_on_Convolutional_Neural_Network","abstract":"In this paper, a face recognition method based on deep learning is studied and implemented. By adjusting the hierarchical depth and structure of the typical convolutional neural network model ResNet, a new network model structure is designed, which uses the LFW face detection benchmark. The database is used for confirmatory experiments. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy and model size of the system have a good performance.","authors":["Yunhao Liu","Jie Yang"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-981-13-9409-6_233","In book: Communications, Signal Processing, and Systems (pp.1925-1929)"],"references":["221275443_Semi-supervised_PCA-Based_Face_Recognition_Using_Self-training","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","301876276_Joint_Face_Detection_and_Alignment_Using_Multitask_Cascaded_Convolutional_Networks"]}
