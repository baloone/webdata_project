{"id":"325967075_Design_Issues_and_Challenges_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed self-organized wireless ad hoc networks which comprise of a large number of resource constrained sensor nodes. The major areas of research in WSN is going on hardware, and operating system of WSN, deployment, architecture, localization, synchronization, programming models, data aggregation and dissemination, database querying, architecture, middleware, quality of service and security. This paper study highlights ongoing research activities and issues that affect the design and performance of Wireless Sensor Network.","authors":["Khushboo Jain","Vaishali Sikka"],"meta":["February 2015International Journal of Computer Applications Volume 112(No 4)","DOI:10.5120/19656-1293"],"references":["259624726_Handling_QoS_Traffic_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224136298_The_Non-uniform_Property_of_Energy_Consumption_and_its_Solution_to_the_Wireless_Sensor_Network","314720381_Mate_a_tiny_virtual_machine_for_sensor_networks","290545918_A_study_of_security_challenges_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","265423508_A_Survey_on_Sensor_Network","232620761_A_Remote_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Water_Quality_Monitoring","228392061_A_Survey_of_Multi-Objective_Deployment_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224761075_A_Localization_Scheme_with_Mobile_Beacon_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224677177_The_Security_Routing_Research_for_WSN_in_the_Application_of_Intelligent_Transport_System","222969320_Composition_and_deployment_of_e-Health_services_over_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"]}
