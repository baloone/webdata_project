{"id":"266221953_Multisymmetric_functions","abstract":"We develop a theory of multisymmetric functions along the lines of the theory of ordinary symmetric functions presented in I. G. Macdonald [Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials (Oxford Mathematical Monographs. Oxford: Clarendon Press) (1979; Zbl 0487.20007)]. We extend this theory to the multihomogeneous case (factorizable forms) in characteristic 0. In addition, we present proofs of several results that appeared in F. Junker [Über symmetrische Funktionen von mehreren Reihen von Veränderlichen, Math. Ann. 43, 225-270 (1893)] without proof, as well as counterexamples to some claims made therein.","authors":["John Dalbec"],"meta":["January 1999Beitrage zur Algebra und Geometrie 40(1)"],"references":[]}
