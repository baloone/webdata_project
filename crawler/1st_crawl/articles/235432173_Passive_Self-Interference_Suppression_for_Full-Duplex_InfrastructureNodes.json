{"id":"235432173_Passive_Self-Interference_Suppression_for_Full-Duplex_InfrastructureNodes","abstract":"Recent research results have demonstrated the feasibility of full-duplex\nwireless communication for short-range links. Although the focus of the\nprevious works has been active cancellation of the self-interference signal, a\nmajority of the overall self-interference suppression is often due to passive\nsuppression, i.e., isolation of the transmit and receive antennas. We present a\nmeasurement-based study of the capabilities and limitations of three key\nmechanisms for passive self-interference suppression: directional isolation,\nabsorptive shielding, and cross-polarization. The study demonstrates that more\nthan 70 dB of passive suppression can be achieved in certain environments, but\nalso establishes two results on the limitations of passive suppression: (1)\nenvironmental reflections limit the amount of passive suppression that can be\nachieved, and (2) passive suppression, in general, increases the frequency\nselectivity of the residual self-interference signal. These results suggest two\ndesign implications: (1) deployments of full-duplex infrastructure nodes should\nminimize near-antenna reflectors, and (2) active cancellation in concatenation\nwith passive suppression should employ higher-order filters or per-subcarrier\ncancellation.","authors":["Evan Everett","Achaleshwar Sahai","Ashutosh Sabharwal"],"meta":["February 2013IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications 13(2)","DOI:10.1109/TWC.2013.010214.130226","SourcearXiv","Project: Massive MIMO Full-duplex"],"references":["274915210_Performance_Analysis_of_Round_Trip_Time_in_Narrowband_RF_Networks_For_Remote_Wireless_Communications","254464239_MIDU_enabling_MIMO_full_duplex","278888723_A_simple_approach_to_a_statistical_path_loss_model_for_indoor_communications","265565410_Fundamentals_of_Wireless_Communication_Hardcover","261662232_Elements_of_Information_Theory","261319966_Decode-and-cancel_for_interference_cancellation_in_a_three-node_full-duplex_network","260635632_Full-Duplex_MIMO_Relaying_Achievable_Rates_Under_Limited_Dynamic_Range","260581698_Full-Duplex_Bidirectional_MIMO_Achievable_Rates_Under_Limited_Dynamic_Range","247931354_Elements_of_information_theory_2_ed","246825250_Microwave_and_RF_Design_of_Wireless_Systems"]}
