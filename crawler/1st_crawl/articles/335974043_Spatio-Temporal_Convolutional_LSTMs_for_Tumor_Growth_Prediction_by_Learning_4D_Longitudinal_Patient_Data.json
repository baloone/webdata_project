Recent advances\nof convolutional networks (ConvNets) have demonstrated\nhigher accuracy than traditional mathematical models can be\nachieved in predicting future tumor volumes. This indicates\nthat deep learning based data-driven techniques may have great\npotentials on addressing such problem. However, current 2D\nimage patch based modeling approaches can not make full use of\nthe spatio-temporal imaging context of the tumor’s longitudinal\n4D (3D + time) patient data. Moreover, they are incapable\nto predict clinically-relevant tumor properties, other than the\ntumor volumes. In this paper, we exploit to formulate the tumor\ngrowth process through convolutional Long Short-Term Memory\n(ConvLSTM) that extract tumor’s static imaging appearances\nand simultaneously capture its temporal dynamic changes within\na single network. We extend ConvLSTM into the spatio-temporal\ndomain (ST-ConvLSTM) by jointly learning the inter-slice 3D\ncontexts and the longitudinal or temporal dynamics from multiple\npatient studies. Our approach can incorporate other nonimaging\npatient information in an end-to-end trainable manner.\nExperiments are conducted on the largest 4D longitudinal tumor\ndataset of 33 patients to date. Results validate that the proposed\nST-ConvLSTM model produces a Dice score of 83.2%+/-5.1%\nand a RVD of 11.2%+/-10.8%, both statistically significantly\noutperforming (p <0.05) other compared methods of traditional\nlinear model, ConvLSTM, and generative adversarial network\n(GAN) under the metric of predicting future tumor volumes.\nAdditionally, our new method enables the prediction of both cell\ndensity and CT intensity numbers. Last, we demonstrate the\ngeneralizability of ST-ConvLSTM by employing it in 4D medical\nimage segmentation task, which achieves an averaged Dice score\nof 86.3%+/-1.2% for left-ventricle segmentation in 4D ultrasound\nwith 3 seconds per patient case.","authors":["Ling Zhang","Le Lu","Xiaosong Wang","Ronald M Summers"],"meta":["September 2019","DOI:10.1109/TMI.2019.2943841","Project: deeply exciting stuff!"],"references":["321503985_A_DCE-MRI_Driven_3-D_Reaction-Diffusion_Model_of_Solid_Tumour_Growth","321089850_Convolutional_Invasion_and_Expansion_Networks_for_Tumor_Growth_Prediction","320975888_Predicting_Scene_Parsing_and_Motion_Dynamics_in_the_Future","319631503_Improving_Deep_Pancreas_Segmentation_in_CT_and_MRI_Images_via_Recurrent_Neural_Contextual_Learning_and_Direct_Loss_Function","319524514_Temporal_Coherency_based_Criteria_for_Predicting_Video_Frames_using_Deep_Multi-stage_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","318915912_Patient_Subtyping_via_Time-Aware_LSTM_Networks","317343979_Personalized_Pancreatic_Tumor_Growth_Prediction_via_Group_Learning","307636576_Combining_Fully_Convolutional_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_3D_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","303544998_Deep_Predictive_Coding_Networks_for_Video_Prediction_and_Unsupervised_Learning","303449434_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Physical_Interaction_through_Video_Prediction","284750843_Standardized_Evaluation_System_for_Left_Ventricular_Segmentation_Algorithms_in_3D_Echocardiography","278413880_Convolutional_LSTM_Network_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Precipitation_Nowcasting","234048969_Prediction_of_Brain_MR_Scans_in_Longitudinal_Tumor_Follow-Up_Studies","51495033_A_Generative_Approach_for_Image-Based_Modeling_of_Tumor_Growth","49822080_Everolimus_for_Advanced_Pancreatic_Neuroendocrine_Tumors","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","7537839_Realistic_Simulation_of_the_3D_Growth_of_Brain_Tumors_in_MR_Images_Coupling_Diffusion_with_Biomechanical_Deformation","3220949_Nonrigid_Registration_Using_Free-Form_Deformations_Application_to_Breast_MR_Images","329747515_Future_Frame_Prediction_for_Anomaly_Detection_-_A_New_Baseline","322277018_Tensorflow_Large-scale_machine_learning_on_heterogeneous_distributed_systems","322113847_Future_Frame_Prediction_for_Anomaly_Detection_--_A_New_Baseline","322060383_Video_Frame_Synthesis_Using_Deep_Voxel_Flow","322057949_Dual_Motion_GAN_for_Future-Flow_Embedded_Video_Prediction","322057605_Predicting_Deeper_into_the_Future_of_Semantic_Segmentation","320964489_Flexible_Spatio-Temporal_Networks_for_Video_Prediction","319770235_Spatio-temporal_video_autoencoder_with_differentiable_memory","319770234_Deep_multi-scale_video_prediction_beyond_mean_square_error","317931899_Decomposing_Motion_and_Content_for_Natural_Video_Sequence_Prediction","316471098_Joint_Sequence_Learning_and_Cross-Modality_Convolution_for_3D_Biomedical_Segmentation","316270230_Learning_to_Generate_Long-term_Future_via_Hierarchical_Prediction","305793943_Pancreatic_Tumor_Growth_Prediction_with_Elastic-Growth_Decomposition_Image-Derived_Motion_and_FDM-FEM_Coupling","299539737_Evaluation_and_management_of_pancreatic_lesions_in_patients_with_von_Hippel-Lindau_disease","260644843_Patient_Specific_Tumor_Growth_Prediction_Using_Multimodal_Images","259806374_Assessment_of_Tumor_Growth_in_Pancreatic_Neuroendocrine_Tumors_in_von_Hippel_Lindau_Syndrome","42803318_Learning_a_Classification-based_Glioma_Growth_Model_Using_MRI_Data","12264072_Swanson_KR_Alvord_JrEC_Murray_JDA_quantitative_model_for_differential_motility_of_gliomas_in_grey_and_white_matter_Cell_Prolif_33_317-329","7232857_Yushkevich_PA_Piven_J_Hazlett_HC_Smith_RG_Ho_S_Gee_JC_Gerig_GUser-guided_3D_active_contour_segmentation_of_anatomical_structures_significantly_improved_efficiency_and_reliability_Neuroimage_311116-112","5820046_An_image-driven_parameter_estimation_problem_for_a_reaction-diffusion_glioma_growth_model_with_mass_effects"]}
