{"id":"322149839_Horizontal_scaling_and_aggregation_across_heterogeneous_clouds_for_resource_provisioning","abstract":"A cloud's elasticity is enhanced by inter-operating with other clouds and borrowing resources from them. Hence, a request from any such inter-operating cloud's user is fulfilled with resources of some individual cloud in the network. However, the request is denied on unavailability of sufficient resources in any individual cloud. In this work, this denial of a user's request is prevented by obtaining resources from multiple clouds and hence, the probability of satisfying the request is improved. This proposal intends to replace the existing resource provisioning technique in an open framework, Cloud Inter-operation Toolkit (CIT), to achieve an increased transaction success rate which is evident from the experimental results obtained from a real-time heterogeneous cloud environment set up using Eucalyptus, OpenNebula and OpenStack. In spite of satisfying a request with resources from multiple clouds, these resources are aggregated and provided in a way that is easily accessible by the user.","authors":["Kirthica S.","Rajeswari Sridhar"],"meta":["December 2017Computers & Electrical Engineering 69","DOI:10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.12.044"],"references":["259343856_CompatibleOne_The_Open_Source_Cloud_Broker","257307773_Interconnecting_Federated_Clouds_by_Using_Publish-Subscribe_Service","272641224_Agent-Based_Interactions_and_Economic_Encounters_in_an_Intelligent_InterCloud"]}
