{"id":"355187342_Dual_continuous_k-frames_in_Hilbert_spaces","abstract":"Frame theory is an active research area in mathematics, computer science and engineering with many 10 exciting applications in a variety of different fields. In this paper we study the notion of dual continuous K-frames 11 in Hilbert spaces. Also we etablish some properties. 12","authors":["Hamid Faraj","Rossafi Mohamed","Brahim Moalige","Samir Kabbaj"],"meta":["October 2021","DOI:10.28919/jmcs/6704","Project: Gabor Frames and Shift-invariant Spaces"],"references":["335004141_Generalized_Frames_for_BH_K","334811290_Continuous_-K-G-Frame_in_Hilbert_-Modules","333133458_Operator_frame_for_End_A_H","320991221_ast-g-frames_in_tensor_products_of_hilbert_Cast-modules","252340981_Painless_Nonorthogonal_Expansions","228570328_Continuous_frames_in_Hilbert_spaces","223843908_Continuous_Frames_in_Hilbert_Space","286672813_A_new_approach_to_continuous_riesz_bases","275928459_An_Introduction_to_Frames_and_Riesz_Bases","243052917_On_Majorization_Factorization_and_Range_Inclusion_of_Operators_on_Hilbert_Space","200524234_A_Class_of_Nonharmonic_Fourier_Series"]}
