{"id":"319770626_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","abstract":"Traditional methods of computer vision and machine learning cannot match human performance on tasks such as the recognition of handwritten digits or trafﬁc signs. Our biologically plausible, wide and deep artiﬁcial neural network architectures can. Small (often minimal) receptive ﬁelds of convolutional winner-take-all neurons yield large network depth, resulting in roughly as many sparsely connected neural layers as found in mammals between retina and visual cortex. Only winner neurons are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed in different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast training. On the very competitive MNIST handwriting benchmark, our method is the ﬁrst to achieve near-human performance. On a trafﬁc sign recognition benchmark it outperforms humans by a factor of two. We also improve the state-of-the-art on a plethora of common image classiﬁcation benchmarks.","authors":["Dan Ciresan","Ueli Meier","Jurgen Schmidhuber"],"meta":["June 2012","Conference: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"references":[]}
