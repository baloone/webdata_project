{"id":"286614996_Debugging_by_Thinking_A_Multidisciplinary_Approach","abstract":"Debugging by Thinking: A Multi-Disciplinary Approach is the first book to apply the wisdom of six disciplinesâlogic, mathematics, psychology, safety analysis, computer science, and engineeringâto the problem of debugging. It uses the methods of literary detectives such as Sherlock Holmes, the techniques of mathematical problem solving, the results of research into the cognitive psychology of human error, the root cause analyses of safety experts, the compiler analyses of computer science, and the processes of modern engineering to define a systematic approach to identifying and correcting software errors.","authors":["R.C.
