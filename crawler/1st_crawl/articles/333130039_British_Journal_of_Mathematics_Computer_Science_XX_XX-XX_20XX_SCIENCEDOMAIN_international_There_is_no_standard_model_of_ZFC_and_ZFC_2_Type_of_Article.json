Main results are: (i) Let M ZF C st be a standard model of ZF C, then ¬Con(ZF C + ∃M ZF C st). (ii) Let M ZF C 2 st be a standard model of ZF C2 with Henkin semantics, then ¬Con(ZF C2 + ∃M ZF C 2 st). (iii) Let k be inaccessible cardinal then ¬Con(ZF C + ∃κ). In order to obtain the statements (i) and (ii) examples of the inconsistent countable set in a set theory ZF C + ∃M ZF C st and in a set theory ZF C2 + ∃M ZF C 2 st were derived. It is widely believed that ZF C + ∃M ZF C st and ZF C2 + ∃M ZF C 2 st are inconsistent, i.e. ZF C and ZF C2 have a standard models. Unfortunately this belief is wrong.","authors":["Jaykov Foukzon","Elena R.
