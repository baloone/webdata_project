{"id":"292342553_Robust_dynamic_schedule_coordination_control_in_the_supply_chain","abstract":"Coordination plays crucial role in supply chain management. In this paper, we extend the existing body of literature on supply chain coordination by representing a robust schedule coordination approach. A hybrid discrete/continuous flow shop supply chain with job shop processes at each supplier stage is studied. For this purpose, the developed scheduling model comprises operations control (for customer order fulfillment dynamics), channel control (production machine and transportation dynamics), resource control (material supply dynamics), and flow control (processing and shipment dynamics) with multiple objectives. Based on the scheduling model, we introduce a robust analysis of schedule coordination in the presence of disruptions in capacities and supply. The application of attainable sets opens a possibility to analyse schedule coordination dynamics under disruptions. The results provide insights of how to integrate the coordination issues into schedule robustness analysis. We exemplify the developed approach for the case of two-stage supply chain coordination, and derive managerial insights for both considered scheduling problem and application of dynamic control methods to supply chain coordination in general.","authors":["Dmitry Ivanov","Alexandre Dolgui","Boris vladimirovich Sokolov"],"meta":["January 2016Computers & Industrial Engineering 94","DOI:10.1016/j.cie.2016.01.009","Projects: Dynamic scheduling in Industry 4.0 and digital supply chain systemsSupply chain design resilience assessment with structure dynamics considerations"],"references":["273057487_Modeling_the_dynamics_of_a_multi-product_manufacturing_system_A_real_case_application","272374076_A_decomposition_based_solution_algorithm_for_U-type_assembly_line_balancing_with_interval_data","271933170_Multi-stage_supply_chain_scheduling_with_non-preemptive_continuous_operations_and_execution_control","271101269_A_dynamic_model_and_an_algorithm_for_short-term_supply_chain_scheduling_in_the_smart_factory_industry_40","263371822_Integrated_selection_of_suppliers_and_scheduling_of_customer_orders_in_the_presence_of_supply_chain_disruption_risks","280790238_Min-Max_and_Min-Max_regret_approaches_to_minimum_cost_tools_selection","269877863_On_the_fair_optimization_of_cost_and_customer_service_level_in_a_supply_chain_under_disruption_risks","269280793_Flexible_job_shop_with_continuous_material_flow","263371941_Distributed_feedback_control_algorithm_in_an_auction-based_manufacturing_planning_and_control_system","263371938_Scheduling_and_co-ordination_of_multi-suppliers_single-warehouse-operator_single-manufacturer_supply_chains_with_variable_production_rates_and_storage_costs","258769905_Robust_balancing_of_straight_assembly_lines_with_interval_task_times","257651324_Supply_Chain_Engineering_Useful_Methods_and_Techniques","257552246_On_Applicability_of_Optimal_Control_Theory_to_Adaptive_Supply_Chain_Planning_and_Scheduling","257516201_Balancing_of_simple_assembly_lines_under_variations_of_task_processing_times","259126073_Joint_supplier_selection_and_scheduling_of_customer_orders_under_disruption_risks_Single_vs_dual_sourcing"]}
