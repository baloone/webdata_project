{"id":"316011472_Welding_quality_monitoring_of_high_frequency_straight_seam_pipe_based_on_image_feature","abstract":"Weld surface images were collected using a machine vision technique, and the geometry and texture features of the images were extracted by MATLAB software. Welding quality was determined by a weighted weld strength, elongation, impact energy and bending angle. A relationship between the welding quality and the image features was established. Experimental results indicate that the welding quality can be described quantitatively by such image features as the defect perimeter, invariant moment of IM1, IM7, IM5, IM4 and rectangular degree, and a BP neural network model can be used to monitor the welding quality online.","authors":["Lixin Li","Lin Xiao","Hanqing Liao","Sheng Liu"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Materials Processing Technology 246:285-290","DOI:10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2017.03.031"],"references":["310388764_Automated_detection_of_welding_defects_in_pipelines_from_radiographic_images_DWDI","292916177_New_method_of_on-line_monitoring_tool_wear_states_based_on_fractal_dimension","290752318_Quality_monitoring_of_resistance_spot_welding_based_on_image_processing_of_welding_spot_surface","282407760_Development_of_a_model_for_friction_stir_weld_quality_assessment_using_machine_vision_and_acoustic_emission_techniques","257422353_Automatic_weld_defect_identification_from_radiographic_images","236226690_Characteristics_and_therapeutic_strategies_for_elderly_patients_with_acute_myeloid_leukemia","222736795_Real-time_automatic_detection_of_weld_defects_in_steel_pipe"]}
