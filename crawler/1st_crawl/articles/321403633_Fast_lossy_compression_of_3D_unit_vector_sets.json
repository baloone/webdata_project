{"id":"321403633_Fast_lossy_compression_of_3D_unit_vector_sets","abstract":"We propose a new efficient ray compression method to be used prior to transmission in a distributed Monte Carlo rendering engine. In particular, we introduce a new compression scheme for unorganized unit vector sets (ray directions) which, combined with state-of-the-art positional compression (ray origin), provides a significant gain in precision compared to classical ray quantization techniques. Given a ray set which directions lie in a subset of the Gauss sphere, our key idea consists in mapping it to the surface of the whole unit sphere, for which collaborative compression achieves a high signal-over-noise ratio. As a result, the rendering engine can distribute efficiently massive ray waves over large heterogeneous networks, with potentially low bandwidth. This opens a way toward Monte Carlo rendering in cloud computing, without the need to access specialized hardware such as rendering farms, to harvest the latent horsepower present in public institutions or companies.","authors":["Sylvain Rousseau","Tamy Boubekeur"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3145749.3149436","Conference: SIGGRAPH Asia 2017 Technical Briefs"],"references":["301612007_A_Survey_of_Efficient_Representations_for_Independent_Unit_Vectors","264417607_Fixed-Rate_Compressed_Floating-Point_Arrays","260532247_Distributed_Out-of-Core_Stochastic_Progressive_Photon_Mapping","309521511_The_Path_to_Path-Traced_Movies","283695093_Spherical_Fibonacci_Mapping","261540093_Sorted_Deferred_Shading_for_Production_Path_Tracing","260731648_Ray_tracing_in_the_cloud_using_MapReduce","255960392_Spherical_Fibonacci_Point_Sets_for_Illumination_Integrals","221357189_Kilauea_parallel_global_illumination_renderer","220506046_On_Floating-Point_Normal_Vectors"]}
