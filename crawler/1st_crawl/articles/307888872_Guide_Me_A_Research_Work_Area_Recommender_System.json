{"id":"307888872_Guide_Me_A_Research_Work_Area_Recommender_System","abstract":"With the advent of Industrial Revolution, not\nonly the choices in various fields increased but also the\nera of computer came into existence thereby\nrevolutionizing the global market. People had numerous\nchoices in front of them that often led to the confusion\nabout what product might actually fulfill their\nrequirements. So the need for having a system which\ncould facilitate the selection criteria and eradicate the\ndilemma of masses, was realized and ultimately\nrecommender systems of present day world were\nintroduced. So we can refer recommender systems as\nsoftware tools that narrow down our choices and provide\nus with the most suitable suggestions as per our\nrequirements. In this paper, we propose a novel\nrecommender system i.e. RWARS (Research Work Area\nRecommender System) that will recommend research\nwork area to a user based on his/her characteristics\nsimilar to those of other users. The characteristics\nconsidered here are hobbies, subjects of interests,\nprogramming skills and future objectives. The proposed\nsystem will use Cosine Similarity approach of\nCollaborative Filtering.","authors":["Richa Sharma","Sharu Vinayak","Rahul Kumar Singh"],"meta":["September 2016International Journal of Intelligent Systems Technologies and Applications 8(9):30-37","DOI:10.5815/ijisa.2016.09.04"],"references":["284358538_FR_A_Recommender_for_Finding_Faculty_Based_on_CF_Technique","282556897_MOOC-Rec_A_case_based_recommender_system_for_MOOCs","272371332_Towards_Improving_Recommender_System_A_Social_Trust-Aware_Approach","260014323_A_new_user_similarity_model_to_improve_the_accuracy_of_collaborative_filtering","257719899_LINK_RECOMMENDER_Collaborative-Filtering_for_Recommending_URLs_to_Twitter_Users","257706641_A_Personalized_Collaborative_Recommendation_Approach_Based_on_Clustering_of_Customers","257498496_Hybrid_attribute-based_recommender_system_for_learning_material_using_genetic_algorithm_and_a_multidimensional_information_model","279502252_From_Tapestry_to_SVD_A_Survey_of_the_Algorithms_That_Power_Recommender_Systems","272853207_Building_Ontologies_for_Cross-domain_Recommendation_on_Facial_Skin_Problem_and_Related_Cosmetics","260982136_Personalized_Research_Paper_Recommendation_System_using_Keyword_Extraction_Based_on_UserProfile"]}
