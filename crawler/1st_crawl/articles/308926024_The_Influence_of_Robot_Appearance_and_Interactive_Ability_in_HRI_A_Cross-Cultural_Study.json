{"id":"308926024_The_Influence_of_Robot_Appearance_and_Interactive_Ability_in_HRI_A_Cross-Cultural_Study","abstract":"It has been shown that human perception of robots changes after the first interaction. It is not clear, however, to which extent the robot’s appearance and interactive abilities influences such changes in perception. In this paper, participants’ perception of two robots with different appearance and interactive modalities are compared before and after a short interaction with the robots. Data from Japanese and Australian participants is evaluated and compared. Experimental results show significant differences in perception depending on the robot type and the time of interaction. As a result of cultural background, perception changes were observed only for Japanese participants on isolated key concepts.","authors":["Kerstin Sophie Haring","David Silvera-Tawil","Katsumi Watanabe","Mari Velonaki"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-47437-3_38","Conference: International Conference on Social Robotics"],"references":["308852680_Perception_of_a_humanoid_robot_A_cross-cultural_comparison","269222701_Perception_of_an_Android_Robot_in_Japan_and_Australia_A_Cross-Cultural_Comparison","264394093_Modeling_first_impressions_from_highly_variable_facial_images","262393213_Let_me_tell_you_Investigating_the_effects_of_robot_communication_strategies_in_advice-giving_situations_based_on_robot_appearance_interaction_modality_and_distance","254060168_The_Uncanny_Valley_From_the_Field","232232088_Dissociating_the_Detection_of_Intentionality_from_Animacy_in_the_Right_Posterior_Superior_Temporal_Sulcus","228106045_Mind_Perception_Is_the_Essence_of_Morality","225723833_Measurement_Instruments_for_the_Anthropomorphism_Animacy_Likeability_Perceived_Intelligence_and_Perceived_Safety_of_Robots","220755236_Classifying_human-robot_interaction_An_updated_taxonomy","4122295_Effect_of_a_robot_on_user_perceptions","2923925_Theory_and_Evaluation_of_Human_Robot_Interactions","277559293_Touching_an_Android_Robot_Would_You_Do_It_and_How","262176845_The_effect_of_robot_appearance_types_on_motivating_donation","261091671_The_influence_of_robot_appearance_on_assessment","235361505_A_Cognitive_Model_of_Antecedents_and_Consequences_of_Satisfaction_Decisions","225687685_Can_a_robot_empathize_with_people","223744869_Testing_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_Across_Cultures_A_Three_Country_Study"]}
