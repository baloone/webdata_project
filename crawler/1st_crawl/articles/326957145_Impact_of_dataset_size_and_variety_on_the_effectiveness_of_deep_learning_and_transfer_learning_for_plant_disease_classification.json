{"id":"326957145_Impact_of_dataset_size_and_variety_on_the_effectiveness_of_deep_learning_and_transfer_learning_for_plant_disease_classification","abstract":"The problem of automatic recognition of plant diseases has been historically based on conventional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks and Decision Trees. However, the prevailing approach has shifted to the application of deep learning concepts, with focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In general, this kind of technique requires large datasets containing a wide variety of conditions to work properly. This is an important limitation, given the many challenges involved in the construction of a suitable image database. In this context, this study investigates how the size and variety of the datasets impact the effectiveness of deep learning techniques applied to plant pathology. This investigation was based on an image database containing 12 plant species, each presenting very different characteristics in terms of number of samples, number of diseases and variety of conditions. Experimental results indicate that while the technical constraints linked to automatic plant disease classification have been largely overcome, the use of limited image datasets for training brings many undesirable consequences that still prevent the effective dissemination of this type of technology.","authors":["Jayme Garcia Arnal Barbedo"],"meta":["October 2018Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 153:46-53","DOI:10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.013","Project: Plant Disease Identification Using Digital Images"],"references":["325824675_Factors_influencing_the_use_of_deep_learning_for_plant_disease_recognition","323357827_Deep_Learning_in_Agriculture_A_Survey","322142005_Identification_of_Apple_Leaf_Diseases_Based_on_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","320306326_X-FIDO_An_Effective_Application_for_Detecting_Olive_Quick_Decline_Syndrome_with_Deep_Learning_and_Data_Fusion","319478399_A_Robust_Deep-Learning-Based_Detector_for_Real-Time_Tomato_Plant_Diseases_and_Pests_Recognition","317959991_Automated_Identification_of_Northern_Leaf_Blight-Infected_Maize_Plants_from_Field_Imagery_Using_Deep_Learning","322941653_Deep_learning_models_for_plant_disease_detection_and_diagnosis","319770277_Deep_Learning_of_Representations_for_Unsupervised_and_Transfer_Learning","318082906_Identification_of_Rice_Diseases_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","317287085_Potato_Disease_Classification_Using_Convolution_Neural_Networks","316976487_Deep_Learning_for_Tomato_Diseases_Classification_and_Symptoms_Visualization","301879540_Using_Deep_Learning_for_Image-Based_Plant_Disease_Detection","295542870_A_review_on_the_main_challenges_in_automatic_plant_disease_identification_based_on_visible_range_images","316561053_A_Deep_Learning-based_Approach_for_Banana_Leaf_Diseases_Classification","284787775_An_open_access_repository_of_images_on_plant_health_to_enable_the_development_of_mobile_disease_diagnostics_through_machine_learning_and_crowdsourcing"]}
