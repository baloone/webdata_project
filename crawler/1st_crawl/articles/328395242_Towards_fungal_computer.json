{"id":"328395242_Towards_fungal_computer","abstract":"We propose that fungi Basidiomycetes can be used as computing devices: information is represented by spikes of electrical activity, a computation is implemented in a mycelium network and an interface is realized via fruit bodies. In a series of scoping experiments, we demonstrate that electrical activity recorded on fruits might act as a reliable indicator of the fungi's response to thermal and chemical stimulation. A stimulation of a fruit is reflected in changes of electrical activity of other fruits of a cluster, i.e. there is distant information transfer between fungal fruit bodies. In an automaton model of a fungal computer, we show how to implement computation with fungi and demonstrate that a structure of logical functions computed is determined by mycelium geometry.","authors":["Andrew Adamatzky"],"meta":["December 2018Interface focus: a theme supplement of Journal of the Royal Society interface 8(6):20180029","DOI:10.1098/rsfs.2018.0029"],"references":["325227463_On_spiking_behaviour_of_oyster_fungi_Pleurotus_djamor","320425719_Microbial_indicators_for_soil_quality","346681082_The_Physiology_of_Fungal_Nutrition","344251378_Simple_Collision-Based_Chemical_Logic_Gates_with_Adaptive_Computing","344122710_Physarum_Machines_Computers_from_Slime_Mould","327325477_The_Challenge_of_the_Individualistic_Mycelium","321542774_Advances_in_Physarum_Machines_Sensing_and_Computing_with_Slime_Mould","314531548_Simple_Collision-Based_Chemical_Logic_Gates_with_Adaptive_Computing","305673945_Associative_Memory_in_Reaction-Diffusion_Chemistry","297211987_Reaction-diffusion_chemistry_implementation_of_associative_memory_neural_network"]}
