{"id":"339900749_Ostrowski_type_inequalities_in_the_sense_of_generalized_K-fractional_integral_operator_for_exponentially_convex_functions","abstract":"The investigation of the proposed methods is effective and convenient for solving the integrodifferential and difference equations. In this note, we introduce the generalized K-fractional integral in terms of a new parameter K > 0 for exponentially convex functions. This paper offers some novel inequalities of Ostrowski-type using the generalized K-fractional integral. In the application viewpoint, we proved several corollaries that investigate for proving Hermite-Hadamard inequalities for generalized K-fractional integral operator. Some numerical examples are offered to explain the obtained results. Moreover, some applications of proposed results are presented to the demonstration of the efficiency of the proposed technique. The numerical results show that our approach is superior to some related methodologies.","authors":["Saima Rashid","Muhammad Aslam Noor","Khalida Inayat Noor","Yuming Chu"],"meta":["March 2020AIMS Mathematics 5(3):2629-2645","DOI:10.3934/math.2020171","Project:  Generalized functions and integral inequalities"],"references":["340012266_On_Polya-Szego_and_Cebysev_type_inequalities_via_generalized_k-fractional_integrals","339825307_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_inequality_by_means_of_a_Green_function","339451150_Some_New_Hermite-Hadamard-Type_Inequalities_Associated_with_Conformable_Fractional_Integrals_and_Their_Applications","338462270_Petrovic-Type_Inequalities_for_Harmonic_h_-convex_Functions","338118276_Converses_of_the_Jensen_inequality_derived_from_the_Green_functions_with_applications_in_information_theory","338058457_Hermite-Hadamard_type_inequalities_for_co-ordinated_convex_and_qausi-convex_functions_and_their_applications","339870716_Inequalities_for_generalized_trigonometric_and_hyperbolic_functions_with_one_parameter","339298760_Notes_on_the_complete_elliptic_integral_of_the_first_kind","338495874_Approximation_for_the_complete_elliptic_integral_of_the_first_kind","338001784_Bounding_the_convex_combination_of_arithmetic_and_integral_means_in_terms_of_one-parameter_harmonic_and_geometric_means"]}
