{"id":"318356051_Elite_opposition-flower_pollination_algorithm_for_quadratic_assignment_problem","abstract":"The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization problems with various practical applications. In This paper, we present an Elite Opposition-Flower Pollination Algorithm (EOFPA) for solving Quadratic Assignment Problems. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested against a set of benchmarks of QAP from the public QAPLIB Library. we compare the algorithm against the best proposals from the related literatures and we determine that the proposed algorithm is superior to some other algorithms.","authors":["Mohamed Abdel-Baset","Lila Abdel-Fatah","HaiZhou Wu","Yongquan Zhou"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 33(1):1-11","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-162141","Project: A complex encoding flower pollination algorithm for constrained engineering optimisation problems"],"references":["306194097_An_Improved_Flower_Pollination_Algorithm_for_Ratios_Optimization_Problems","301335680_A_Hybrid_Flower_Pollination_Algorithm_for_Engineering_Optimization_Problems","301318208_Application_of_Flower_Pollination_algorithm_for_optimal_placement_and_sizing_of_Distributed_Generation_in_Distribution_systems","276281855_Implementation_of_a_Discrete_Firefly_Algorithm_for_the_QAP_Problem_within_the_SEAGE_Framework","275716879_A_multi-parent_genetic_algorithm_for_the_quadratic_assignment_problem","267632439_An_Improved_Flower_Pollination_Algorithm_with_Chaos","267632344_A_Novel_Hybrid_Flower_Pollination_Algorithm_with_Chaotic_Harmony_Search_for_Solving_Sudoku_Puzzles","262581468_Flower_pollination_algorithm_A_novel_approach_for_multiobjective_optimization","262488977_A_Genetic_Algorithm_for_solving_Quadratic_Assignment_ProblemQAP","261349991_Solving_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem_with_the_modified_hybrid_PSO_algorithm","259367932_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","242931521_Scheduling_Parallel_Production_Lines_with_Changeover_Costs_Practical_Application_of_a_Quadratic_Assignment_LP_Approach","222675611_A_survey_of_the_quadratic_assignment_problem","222529149_A_Greedy_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","220669322_TS_Applied_to_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","2762357_The_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","308365457_A_hybrid_flower_pollination_algorithm_for_solving_ill-conditioned_set_of_equations","304571602_An_Effective_Hybrid_Flower_Pollination_and_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Constrained_Optimization_Problems","303804221_Discrete_Cat_Swarm_Optimization_for_Solving_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","301475890_Ant_Colony_Optimization_for_Solving_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","288932645_Elite_opposition-based_flower_pollination_algorithm","285088013_Optimization_of_the_typewriter_keyboard_by_simulation","281601184_The_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","274783028_Hybrid_teaching-learning-based_optimization_algorithms_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","270371741_The_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem-Theory_and_Algorithms","246386546_Hospital_Layout_as_a_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","242516013_The_Backboard_Wiring_Problem_A_Placement_Algorithm","239060044_Solving_Quadratic_Assignment_Problems_By_'Simulated_Annealing'","220521229_Using_Quadratic_Assignment_Methods_to_Generate_Initial_Permutations_for_Least-Squares_Unidimensional_Scaling_of_Symmetric_Proximity_Matrices","23793266_On_the_quadratic_assignment_problem","4941433_QAPLIB-A_quadratic_assignment_problem_library","4860054_Assignment_Problems_and_the_Location_of_Economic_Activity","3623274_Particle_swarm_Optimization","2782484_QAPLIB-a_quadratic_assignment_problem_library"]}
