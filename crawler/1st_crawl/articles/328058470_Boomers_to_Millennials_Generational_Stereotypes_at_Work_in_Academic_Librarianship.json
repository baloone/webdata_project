{"id":"328058470_Boomers_to_Millennials_Generational_Stereotypes_at_Work_in_Academic_Librarianship","abstract":"Over the past 30 years, as the American workforce has become more generationally diverse, library administrators and academic librarians alike have focused on navigating dynamics that arise in a multigenerational workplace. Much scholarly research has been conducted on generational differences; however, most of this research assumes that the individuals studied adhere to or believe in generational stereotypes. This exploratory study used a hybrid experience-perception survey to examine the role or influence generational stereotypes have on academic librarians and how those stereotypes influence the academic library workforce. While few specific generational stereotypes were found to be held by participants, perceptions of generational stereotypes still have a significant influence in academic librarians' interactions with their colleagues. This finding means that regardless of their validity, the impact of generational stereotypes cannot be disregarded in academic library workplaces.","authors":["Jessica Hayes","Cecelia Parks","Samantha Mcneilly","Phill Johnson"],"meta":["October 2018The Journal of Academic Librarianship 44(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.acalib.2018.09.011"],"references":["319171209_An_examination_of_generational_stereotypes_as_a_path_towards_reverse_ageism","286253981_Entice_engage_endure_adapting_evidence-based_retention_strategies_to_a_new_generation_of_nurses","282661765_Generational_Differences_in_the_Workplace_There_Is_Complexity_Beyond_the_Stereotypes","282633751_Generationally_Based_Differences_in_the_Workplace_Is_There_a_There_There","280558255_Generational_Differences_Are_Real_and_Useful","279908831_Managing_Our_Future_The_Generation_X_Factor","271288404_Digital_Native_Academic_Librarians_Technology_Skills_and_Their_Relationship_with_Technology","264580977_Generational_differences_in_workplace_behavior","263162885_Bracing_for_the_Millennial_Workforce_Looking_for_Ways_to_Inspire_Generation_Y","262463895_The_Silent_Revolution_in_Europe_Intergenerational_Change_in_Post-Industrial_Societies","260219890_Generation_Gap_Is_There_any_Solid_Solution_From_Human_Relation_Point_of_View","258180040_Rethinking_Generation_Me_A_Study_of_Cohort_Effects_From_1976-2006","254116717_Actual_Versus_Perceived_Generational_Differences_at_Work_An_Empirical_Examination","237535996_Ethnic_and_National_Stereotypes_The_Princeton_Trilogy_Revisited_and_Revised","232584255_Stereotyping_prejudice_and_discrimination","228360704_Generational_Differences_in_Work_Values_Leisure_and_Extrinsic_Values_Increasing_Social_and_Intrinsic_Values_Decreasing","46037140_Stereotype_Embodiment_A_Psychosocial_Approach_to_Aging","45657922_Generational_Change_in_Australian_Librarianship_Viewpoints_from_Generation_X","44630352_Millennials_in_the_Workplace_A_Communication_Perspective_on_Millennials'_Organizational_Relationships_and_Performance","345858138_Research_Methods_for_Political_Science_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Methods","325670955_A_model_of_often_mixed_stereotype_content_Competence_and_warmth_respectively_follow_from_perceived_status_and_competition","324123361_False_Narratives_of_Generational_Difference_in_Academic_Libraries_Toward_an_Intersectional_Approach","317202362_Communicating_With_Employees_Resisting_the_Stereotypes_of_Generational_Cohorts_in_the_Workplace","316540090_The_Silent_Revolution_Changing_Values_and_Political_Styles_Among_Western_Publics","293529319_The_Click_and_Clash_of_Generations","285821664_Stereotypes_and_prejudice_create_workplace_discrimination","284689790_The_generation_gap_More_myth_than_reality","282476541_Multigenerational_perceptions_of_the_academic_work_environment_in_higher_education_in_the_United_States","281264301_Cross-Generational_Valuing_Among_Peer_Academic_Librarians","280743455_Stereotypes_and_Prejudice_Their_Automatic_and_Controlled_Components","277913575_Beyond_the_Generational_Stereotypes_A_Study_of_US_Generation_Y_Employees_in_Context","276086962_Followers_and_Generations_in_the_Workplace","266250772_The_Southeastern_Librarian_I_Have_Shoes_Older_Than_You_Generational_Diversity_In_The_Library","263562927_Organising_Generations_-_What_Can_Sociology_Offer_to_the_Understanding_of_Generations_at_Work","261586494_Generational_and_Regional_Differences_in_Media_Consumption_Patterns_of_Chinese_Generation_X_Consumers","260499700_Generational_differences_in_psychological_traits_and_their_impact_on_the_workplace","259255436_Generations_The_History_of_America's_Future_1584-2069","259120281_Gender_stereotypes_and_workplace_bias","259096356_Millennials_among_the_Professional_Workforce_in_Academic_Libraries_Their_Perspective_on_Leadership","256707916_When_Generations_Collide_Who_They_Are_Why_They_Clash_How_to_Solve_the_Generational_Puzzle_at_Work","256294015_Exploratory_Research_In_The_Social_Sciences","237516407_Academic_Library_Services_for_the_Millennial_Generationm","232527505_Racial_stereotypes_of_one_hundred_college_students","227739592_A_Generational_Approach_to_Understanding_Students","225579689_Millennials_and_the_World_of_Work_An_Economist's_Perspective","51537844_Managing_Multiple_Generations_Scenarios_From_the_Workplace","17817551_On_the_fading_of_social_stereotypes_Studies_in_three_generations_of_college_students","17607172_Social_Gerontology_and_the_Age_Stratification_of_Society","17340434_The_Cohort_as_a_Concept_in_the_Study_of_Social_Change","12146706_Multigeneration_Employees_Strategies_for_Effective_Management","8809328_Stereotype_Persistence_and_Change_Among_College_Students","5675521_An_Empirical_Assessment_of_Generational_Differences_in_Basic_Human_Values"]}
