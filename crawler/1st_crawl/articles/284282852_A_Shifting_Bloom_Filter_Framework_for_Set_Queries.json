{"id":"284282852_A_Shifting_Bloom_Filter_Framework_for_Set_Queries","abstract":"Set queries are fundamental operations in computer systems and applications. This paper addresses the fundamental problem of designing a probabilistic data structure that can quickly process set queries using a small amount of memory. We propose a Shifting Bloom Filter (ShBF) framework for representing and querying sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShBF using three types of popular set queries: membership, association, and multiplicity queries. The key novelty of ShBF is on encoding the auxiliary information of a set element in a location offset. In contrast, prior BF based set data structures allocate additional memory to store auxiliary information. To evaluate ShBF in comparison with prior art, we conducted experiments using real-world network traces. Results show that ShBF significantly advances the state-of-the-art on all three types of set queries.","authors":["Tong Yang","Alex X Liu","Muhammad Shahzad","Yuankun Zhong"],"meta":["September 2016","Conference: To appear in VLDB 2016","Project: Shifting Framework for Set Queries"],"references":["241770181_MAPLE_A_scalable_architecture_for_maintaining_packet_latency_measurements","234832071_Dynamic_count_filters","226884457_Less_Hashing_Same_Performance_Building_a_Better_Bloom_Filter","226837101_Hash-Based_Techniques_for_High-Speed_Packet_Processing","224230450_Theory_and_Practice_of_Bloom_Filters_for_Distributed_Systems","269298352_KBF_A_Bloom_Filter_for_key-value_storage_with_an_application_on_approximate_state_machines","269298259_Bloom_tree_A_search_tree_based_on_Bloom_filters_for_multiple-set_membership_testing","228957149_Bloom_filters_Design_innovations_and_novel_applications","227761150_Less_hashing_same_performance_Building_a_better_Bloom_filter","224500308_Fast_Dynamic_Multiset_Membership_Testing_Using_Combinatorial_Bloom_Filters"]}
