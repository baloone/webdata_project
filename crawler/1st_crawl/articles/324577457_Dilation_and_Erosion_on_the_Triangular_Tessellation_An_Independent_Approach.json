{"id":"324577457_Dilation_and_Erosion_on_the_Triangular_Tessellation_An_Independent_Approach","abstract":"In this paper, a new idea for morphological operations, i.e., dilation and erosion on the regular triangular tessellation is presented. The triangles have two orientations; they are addressed by zero-sum and one-sum triplets and called even and odd pixels, respectively. The triangular grid is not a lattice, that is, there are grid vectors that do not translate the grid to itself. Different sets of vectors translate the even and odd pixels into the grid: for even pixels vectors with sum 0 and 1 can be used, while for odd pixels vectors with sum 0 and –1 are appropriate. Based on this fact, we introduce a technique in which one can work “independently” with the even and the odd pixels in morphological operations. Examples and various properties of the “independent” dilation and erosion are analyzed.","authors":["Mohsen Abdalla","Benedek Nagy"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2827566"],"references":["228715660_Generalised_Triangular_Grids_in_Digital_Geometry","221016852_Thinning_on_Quadratic_Triangular_and_Hexagonal_Cell_Complexes","317234024_On_the_Chamfer_Polygons_on_the_Triangular_Grid","314711889_Unified_Characterization_of_P-Simple_Points_in_Triangular_Square_and_Hexagonal_Grids","314711460_Concepts_of_Binary_Morphological_Operations_Dilation_and_Erosion_on_the_Triangular_Grid","312549223_On_topology_preservation_of_mixed_operators_in_triangular_square_and_hexagonal_grids","301672268_A_linear-time_algorithm_to_compute_the_triangular_hull_of_a_digital_object","300076715_Digital_Disks_by_Weighted_Distances_in_the_Triangular_Grid","297728755_Error_analysis_of_octagonal_distances_defined_by_periodic_neighborhood_sequences_for_approximating_Euclidean_metrics_in_arbitrary_dimension","271828281_Image_Analysis_and_Mathematical_Morphology_Vol_1","271737947_Cellular_topology_and_topological_coordinate_systems_on_the_hexagonal_and_on_the_triangular_grids","271630240_Topology_preservation_on_the_triangular_grid","268161559_Mathematical_Morphology_From_Theory_to_Applications","267664184_Cellular_Topology_on_the_Triangular_Grid","266553350_Mathematics_of_Shape_Description_A_Morphological_Approach_to_Image_Processing_and_Computer_Graphics","266541293_On_Topology_Preservation_for_Triangular_Thinning_Algorithms","264161377_Adaptive_mathematical_morphology_-_A_survey_of_the_field","261458198_On_topology_preservation_in_triangular_square_and_hexagonal_grids","258023634_Image_Processing_and_Mathematical_Morphology_Fundamentals_and_Applications","256182127_Octagonal_distances_for_digital_pictures","248835388_Distance_functions_based_on_neighborhood_sequences","234831630_Thinning_Algorithms_on_Rectangular_Hexagonal_and_Triangular_Arrays","224608019_Isometric_transformations_of_the_dual_of_the_hexagonal_lattice","224114988_Adaptivity_and_group_invariance_in_mathematical_morphology","222446455_Distance_functions_on_digital_pictures","222407660_On_geometric_multigrid_methods_for_triangular_grids_using_three-coarsening_strategy","222342321_Approximating_Euclidean_circles_by_neighbourhood_sequences_in_a_hexagonal_grid","221954020_The_algebraic_basis_of_mathematical_morphology_II_Openings_and_closings","220644613_Characterization_of_digital_circles_in_triangular_grid","220632595_The_algebraic_basis_of_mathematical_morphology_I_Dilations_and_erosions","220601112_Distance_functions_defined_by_variable_neghbor-hood_sequences","220500934_Geometric_transformations_on_the_hexagonal_grid","4291702_Optimal_Neighborhood_Sequences_on_the_Hexagonal_Grid","4073608_A_family_of_triangular_grids_in_digital_geometry","3905744_Shortest_path_in_triangular_grids_with_neighbourhood_sequences","3046631_Distance_on_a_Hexagonal_Grid","3045278_Hexagonal_Parallel_Pattern_Transformations"]}
