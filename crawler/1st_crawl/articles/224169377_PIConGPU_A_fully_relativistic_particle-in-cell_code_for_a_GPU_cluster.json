{"id":"224169377_PIConGPU_A_fully_relativistic_particle-in-cell_code_for_a_GPU_cluster","abstract":"The particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm is one of the most widely used algorithms in computational plasma physics. With the advent of graphical processing units (GPUs), large-scale plasma simulations on inexpensive GPU clusters are in reach. We present an implementation of a fully relativistic plasma PIC algorithm for GPUs based on the NVIDIA CUDA library. It supports a hybrid architecture consisting of single computation nodes interconnected in a standard cluster topology, with each node carrying one or more GPUs. The internode communication is realized using the message-passing interface. The simulation code PIConGPU presented in this paper is, to our knowledge, the first scalable GPU cluster implementation of the PIC algorithm in plasma physics.","authors":["Heiko Burau","Rene Widera","Wolfgang Hoenig","Guido Juckeland"],"meta":["November 2010IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science 38(10):2831 - 2839","DOI:10.1109/TPS.2010.2064310","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["232026630_Three-dimensional_electromagnetic_relativistic_particle-in-cell_code_VLPL_Virtual_Laser_Plasma_Lab","228867773_Three-dimensional_particle-in-cell_simulations_of_laser_wakefield_experiments","253310951_Accelerating_a_Particle-in-Cell_Simulation_Using_a_Hybrid_Counting_Sort","229137535_Exact_charge_conservation_scheme_for_Particle-in-Cell_simulation_with_an_arbitrary_form-factor","225092419_Computer_Simulation_Using_Particles","220781815_0374_Pflops_trillion-particle_kinetic_modeling_of_laser_plasma_interaction_on_Roadrunner","220380419_Fast_parallel_Particle-To-Grid_interpolation_for_plasma_PIC_simulations_on_the_GPU","215490240_Numerical_Solution_of_Initial_Boundary_Value_Problem_Involving_Maxwell's_Equations_in_Isotropic_Media","202924014_Plasma_Physics_Via_Computer_Simulation","27265354_Laser_wake_field_acceleration_The_highly_non-linear_broken-wave_regime"]}
