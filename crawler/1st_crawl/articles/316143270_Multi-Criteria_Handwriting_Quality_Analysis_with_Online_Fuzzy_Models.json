{"id":"316143270_Multi-Criteria_Handwriting_Quality_Analysis_with_Online_Fuzzy_Models","abstract":"IntuiScript is an innovative project aiming at the development of a digital workbook providing feedback during the handwriting learning process for children from three to seven years old. In this context, the paper presents a method to analyse handwriting quality that responds to the expectations of the IntuiScript educational scenario: on-line and real time feedback for children, an automatic detection of children mistakes guiding the pedagogical progression, and a precise analysis of children writing saved to help teacher to understand children writing skills. The presented method introduces a multi-criteria architecture to analyse handwriting quality based on three different aspects: shape, order and direction. The validation of the proposed approach is done on a realistic dataset collected in preschools and primary schools with 952 children. Results show a positive feedback of children and teachers about the use of tactile digital devices, and a significant improvement of the performances of the multi-criteria architecture compared to the previous analyser. The ground truth has been annotated by experts with different levels of confidence. Specific evaluation metrics are introduced to deal with confidence annotations.","authors":["Damien Simonnet","Eric Anquetil","Manuel Bouillon"],"meta":["April 2017Pattern Recognition 69","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2017.04.003"],"references":["321197265_On-Line_Signature_Verification_by_Multi-domain_Classification","264763007_Handwriting_in_early_childhood_education_Current_research_and_future_implications","261316234_Handwritten_Signature_Verification_New_Advancements_and_Open_Issues","259986099_Analysis_of_cursive_letters_syllables_and_words_handwriting_in_a_French_second-grade_child_with_Developmental_Coordination_Disorder_and_comparison_with_typically_developing_children","259273067_Evaluation_of_a_tactile_training_for_handwriting_acquisition_in_French_kindergarten_children_A_pilot_study","244480392_Validation_of_the_Chinese_Handwriting_Analysis_System_CHAS_for_primary_school_students_in_Hong_Kong","323243912_Reprint_of_'Development_maturation_and_learning_influence_on_handwriting_kinematics'","280855908_Children's_stroke_sequence_errors_in_writing_Chinese_characters","261522137_ILClass_Error-Driven_Antecedent_Learning_For_Evolving_Takagi-Sugeno_Classification_Systems","234619259_Much_More_than_the_ABCs_The_Early_Stages_of_Reading_and_Writing"]}
