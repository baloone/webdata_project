{"id":"44834997_Gender_analysis_of_student_enrolment_in_Nigerian_universities","abstract":"Incl. abstract, graphs., tabl., bibl. The paper analysed the trend and pattern of gender enrolment in Nigerian Universities between 1989 and 1997. It critically examined the gender disparity in university enrolment generally, as well as among some selected disciplines and the country's geo-political zones. The analysis revealed that gap existed between female and male in the university enrolment with lower female enrolment in all aspects of the Universities. Specifically there was a wide gap in the sciences and science-based disciplines and also between the Northern and Southern zones with higher female enrolment in the south than the north. The paper made useful suggestions to narrow the gender gap in the university enrolment in the nearest future, which included sustained enlightenment programmes, fine-tuning labour laws and accommodating female under the \"educationally disadvantaged'' admission policy being enjoyed by some citizens of the country.","authors":["Kola Adeyemi","Nelson Ejiro Akpotu"],"meta":["October 2004Higher Education 48(3)","DOI:10.1023/B:HIGH.0000035547.19318.27"],"references":["270329319_The_Sociology_of_Education_A_Systematic_Analysis","226572894_Class_gender_and_societal_inequalities_A_study_of_Nigerian_and_Thai_undergraduate_students","44830070_Equality_of_access_and_catchment_area_factor_in_university_admissions_in_Nigeria","44828652_An_Introduction_to_the_Economics_of_Education","37689695_Educated_In_Romance_Women_Achievement_and_College_Culture","34002821_Educational_and_gender_equality_in_vocational_education_the_case_of_commercial_education_in_Finland"]}
