{"id":"305176551_Some_Properties_of_Antistochastic_Strings","abstract":"Algorithmic statistics is a part of algorithmic information theory (Kolmogorov complexity theory) that studies the following task: given a finite object x (say, a binary string), find an ‘explanation’ for it, i.e., a simple finite set that contains x and where x is a ‘typical element’. Both notions (‘simple’ and ‘typical’) are defined in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. It is known that this cannot be achieved for some objects: there are some “non-stochastic” objects that do not have good explanations. In this paper we study the properties of maximally non-stochastic objects; we call them “antistochastic”. In this paper, we demonstrate that the antistochastic strings have the following property (Theorem 6): if an antistochastic string x has complexity k, then any k bit of information about x are enough to reconstruct x (with logarithmic advice). In particular, if we erase all but k bits of this antistochastic string, the erased bits can be restored from the remaining ones (with logarithmic advice). As a corollary we get the existence of good list-decoding codes with erasures (or other ways of deleting part of the information). Antistochastic strings can also be used as a source of counterexamples in algorithmic information theory. We show that the symmetry of information property fails for total conditional complexity for antistochastic strings.
