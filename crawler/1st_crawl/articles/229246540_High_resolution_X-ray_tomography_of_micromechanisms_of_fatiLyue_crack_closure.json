{"id":"229246540_High_resolution_X-ray_tomography_of_micromechanisms_of_fatiLyue_crack_closure","abstract":"Fatigue crack closure has been studied in an aluminium alloy via microtomography. Gallium wetting has been used to visualise grain structure, along with electron backscattered diffraction assessment of grain orientations and crack trajectories. Through this synthesis of techniques, a detailed direct assessment of microstructure and closure micromechanisms has been achieved.","authors":["K.H.
