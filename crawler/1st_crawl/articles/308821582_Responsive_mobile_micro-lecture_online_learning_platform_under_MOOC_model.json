{"id":"308821582_Responsive_mobile_micro-lecture_online_learning_platform_under_MOOC_model","abstract":"Based on an analysis and study of micro lecture teaching and status of the construction of micro-lecture platform at both home and abroad, a responsive mobile micro-lecture online learning platform is established under the guidance of the Constructivist Learning Theory. The platform is an extended version of the network-based micro-lecture, consistent to the concept of \"Responsive Web Design\", and able to integrate modern educational technology, mobile communication technology, as well as network technology together. It offers the learner a self-help, display, learning, testing, communication, and evaluation learning environment.","authors":["Xuan Chen","Wenbin Wang","Junyan Luo","Zewen Fang"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250400","Conference: 2015 10th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)"],"references":[]}
