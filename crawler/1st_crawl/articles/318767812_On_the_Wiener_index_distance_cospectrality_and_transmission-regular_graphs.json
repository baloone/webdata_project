{"id":"318767812_On_the_Wiener_index_distance_cospectrality_and_transmission-regular_graphs","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate various algebraic and graph theoretic properties of the distance matrix of a graph. Two graphs are D-cospectral if their distance matrices have the same spectrum. We construct infinite pairs of D-cospectral graphs with different diameter and different Wiener index. A graph is k-transmission-regular if its distance matrix has constant row sum equal to k. We establish tight upper and lower bounds for the row sum of a k-transmission-regular graph in terms of the number of vertices of the graph. Finally, we determine the Wiener index and its complexity for linear k-trees, and obtain a closed form for the Wiener index of block-clique graphs in terms of the Laplacian eigenvalues of the graph. The latter leads to a generalization of a result for trees which was proved independently by Mohar and Merris.","authors":["Aida Abiad","Boris Brimkov","Aysel Erey","Lorinda Leshock"],"meta":["July 2017Discrete Applied Mathematics 230(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2017.07.010"],"references":["303143501_Note_on_the_Bounds_on_Wiener_Number_of_a_Graph","290511715_Graphs_with_few_distinct_distance_eigenvalues_irrespective_of_the_diameters","283736670_The_Edge-Wiener_Index_of_Benzenoid_Systems_in_Linear_Time","282639507_Mathematical_aspects_of_Wiener_index","272880172_Cycles_the_Degree_Distance_and_the_Wiener_Index","271855391_Minimizing_Wiener_Index_for_Vertex-Weighted_Trees_with_Given_Weight_and_Degree_Sequences","266518863_Distance_spectrum_of_graph_compositions","264123065_Estimating_the_distance_Estrada_index","263250446_Parameters_Related_to_Tree-Width_Zero_Forcing_and_Maximum_Nullity_of_a_Graph","260676299_On_Wiener_Index_of_Common_Neighborhood_Graphs","233844156_On_the_Wiener_index_and_the_eccentric_distance_sum_of_hypergraphs","233409429_On_Wiener_polarity_index_of_cactus_graphs","223683773_Average_distance_in_weighted_graphs","220569635_A_characterization_of_block_graphs","304267529_A_construction_of_distance_cospectral_graphs","302918108_Orientations_of_graphs_with_maximum_Wiener_index","284080453_Spectral_properties_of_distance_matrix_of_graphs","281307082_On_the_largest_eigenvalue_of_the_distance_matrix_of_a_tree","279602985_Extremal_Wiener_Index_of_Trees_with_Given_Number_of_Vertices_of_Even_Degree","279592568_On_the_Wiener_Index_of_Trees_with_Given_Number_of_Branching_Vertices","279592511_Vertex_Version_of_the_Wiener_Theorem","264596486_On_the_Addressing_Problem_for_Loop_Switching","263545536_Distance_spectra_of_graphs_A_survey","256805294_Forbidden_minors_for_the_class_of_graphs_G_with_xG2xG2","255983817_Contraction_Formulas_For_Kirchhoff_And_Wiener_Indices","247047487_On_the_Spectral_Characterisation_of_Trees","243041315_An_edge_version_of_the_matrix-tree_theorem_and_the_Wiener_Index","242987342_Three-connected_graphs_whose_maximum_nullity_is_at_most_three","233748306_On_the_Wiener_index_and_the_eccentric_distance_sum_of_hypergraphs","229677521_The_distance_spectrum_of_a_tree","229365293_On_the_largest_eigenvalue_of_the_distance_matrix_of_a_connected_graph","228525282_Subclasses_of_k-trees_Characterization_and_recognition","226754198_Eigenvalues_Diameter_and_Mean_Distance_in_Graphs","225192304_Wiener_Index_of_Trees_Theory_and_Applications","223150191_Sharp_bounds_on_the_distance_spectral_radius_and_the_distance_energy_of_graphs","222755102_Minimal_acyclic_forbidden_minors_for_the_family_of_graphs_with_bounded_path-width","222646777_Algorithms_for_graphs_of_bounded_treewidth_via_orthogonal_range_searching","220620552_Bipartitie_Graphs_with_Balanced_a_b-Partitions","220297169_On_distance-balanced_graphs","220296969_Strongly_distance-balanced_graphs_and_graph_products","2134961_The_Graphs_for_which_the_Maximum_Multiplicity_of_an_Eigenvalue_is_Two"]}
