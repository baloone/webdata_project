{"id":"224911969_Contributions_of_cochlea-scaled_entropy_and_consonant-vowel_boundaries_to_prediction_of_speech_intelligibility_in_noise","abstract":"Recent evidence suggests that spectral change, as measured by cochlea-scaled entropy (CSE), predicts speech intelligibility better than the information carried by vowels or consonants in sentences. Motivated by this finding, the present study investigates whether intelligibility indices implemented to include segments marked with significant spectral change better predict speech intelligibility in noise than measures that include all phonetic segments paying no attention to vowels/consonants or spectral change. The prediction of two intelligibility measures [normalized covariance measure (NCM), coherence-based speech intelligibility index (CSII)] is investigated using three sentence-segmentation methods: relative root-mean-square (RMS) levels, CSE, and traditional phonetic segmentation of obstruents and sonorants. While the CSE method makes no distinction between spectral changes occurring within vowels/consonants, the RMS-level segmentation method places more emphasis on the vowel-consonant boundaries wherein the spectral change is often most prominent, and perhaps most robust, in the presence of noise. Higher correlation with intelligibility scores was obtained when including sentence segments containing a large number of consonant-vowel boundaries than when including segments with highest entropy or segments based on obstruent/sonorant classification. These data suggest that in the context of intelligibility measures the type of spectral change captured by the measure is important.","authors":["Fei Chen","Philipos C Loizou"],"meta":["May 2012The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 131(5):4104-13","DOI:10.1121/1.3695401","SourcePubMed","Project: Speech intelligibility evaluation"],"references":["224150272_A_short-time_objective_intelligibility_measure_for_time-frequency_weighted_noisy_speech","297204936_DERIVATION_OF_PRIMARY_PARAMETERS_AND_PROCEDURES_FOR_USE_IN_SPEECH-INTELLIGIBILITY_PREDICTIONS","297120907_Tests_for_comparing_elements_of_a_correlation_matrix","265414192_IEEE_Recommended_Pratice_for_Speech_Quality_Measurements","257142925_Evaluation_of_speech_transmission_channels_by_using_artificial_signals","253911706_Validation_of_the_Articulation_Index","246813981_Methods_for_the_Calculation_and_Use_of_the_Articulation_Index","242012062_Speech_Enhancement_Theory_and_Practice","234426359_Some_applications_of_the_Speech_Transmission_Index_STI_in_auditoria","232488655_Tests_for_Comparing_Elements_of_a_Correlation_Matrix"]}
