In this article, I demonstrate that the same algorithm will allow to find the optimal solutions for the knapsack problem.","authors":["Mohamed Sghiar"],"meta":["September 2016IOSR Journal of Mathematics 12(05):54-57","DOI:10.9790/5728-1205035457"],"references":["304023541_Atomic_algorithm_and_the_servers's_use_to_find_the_Hamiltonian_cycles","306246968_An_electronic_algorithm_to_find_the_optimal_solution_for_the_travelling_salesman_problem","294873879_Algorithmes_quantiques_cycles_hamiltoniens_et_la_k-coloration_des_graphes","273798010_Graph_Theory","228057841_Combinatorial_Problems_Exercises","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","44260596_A_Polynomial_Time_Algorithm_for_Hamilton_Cycle_Path","3083109_Hiding_Information_and_Receipts_in_Trapdoor_Knapsacks"]}
