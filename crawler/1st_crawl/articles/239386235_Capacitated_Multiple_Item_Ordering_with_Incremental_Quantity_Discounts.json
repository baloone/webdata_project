{"id":"239386235_Capacitated_Multiple_Item_Ordering_with_Incremental_Quantity_Discounts","abstract":"This paper presents a heuristic algorithm for determining order quantities for multiple items given incremental quantity discounts and a single resourse constraint. The heuristic is based on Lagrangian relaxation. The performance of the heuristic is compared, for small problems, with a procedure that generates optimal solutions. Results from computational experiments are given that demonstrate the quality and computational efficiency of the heuristic algorithm.","authors":["Faruk Guder","James L. Zydiak","Sohail S.
