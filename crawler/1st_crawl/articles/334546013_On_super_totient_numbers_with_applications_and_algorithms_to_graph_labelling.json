{"id":"334546013_On_super_totient_numbers_with_applications_and_algorithms_to_graph_labelling","abstract":"For any subset S = {0, 1, 2, , n − 1} of integers, the number φ(n) count the members of\nS which are co-prime to n. We attach an additional property to these numbers as: if the\nelements of S which are relatively prime to n can be separated into two disjoint subsets\nof equal sums then n is called a super totient number. Let G = (V, E) be a given graph.\nA monotonically increasing function h on the set of vertices V of G into subset of natural\nnumbers will be called super totient labeling of G, if the function h∗ on the set of edges\nE of G into natural numbers given by h∗(ab) = h(a)h(b) gives a super totient number for\nall edges ab ∈ E, where a, b ∈ V. Graphs admitting such functions will be termed as super\ntotient graphs. A Complete characterization of super totient numbers together with their\napplications and algorithms in graph labeling for some classes of well-known graphs such as lattice graphs, binary tree graphs and k-ary tree graphs is proposed.","authors":["Muhammad Khalid Mahmood","Shahbaz Ali"],"meta":["January 2019Ars Combinatoria -Waterloo then Winnipeg- 143(3):29-38"],"references":[]}
