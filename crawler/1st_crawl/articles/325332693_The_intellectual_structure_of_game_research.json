{"id":"325332693_The_intellectual_structure_of_game_research","abstract":"This article maps out the main areas of game research through an analysis of co-citation and keyword co-occurrence patterns in 24,128 game research documents between 1966 and 2016. The keyword analysis identifies 4 communities: Education/Culture, Technology, Effects and Medical. Co-citation analysis identifies 5 communities: Education, Humanities/Social Science, Computer Science, Communications, and Health. Burst analysis of keywords reveals when key research themes emerged across the period. Key findings are: the main division in game research is between Communications and Health on the one hand and Education, Humanities/Social Science and Computer Science on the other; design is an important bridge between different communities; and there exists a gap in research on the game industry. The research is a broad overview and future research that targets specific communities to tease out more specific patterns is recommended, as is research targeting non-English language sources.","authors":["Paul Martin"],"meta":["May 2018Game Studies 18(1)"],"references":["319349169_Need_for_Perspective_Introducing_the_Special_Issue_Reflecting_and_Evaluating_Game_Studies","281647216_Digital_Games_Research_A_Survey_Study_on_an_Emerging_Field_and_Its_Prevalent_Debates","272174763_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Citation_Networks","255723081_Profiling_40_Years_of_Research_in_Simulation_Gaming","310465758_What_We_Know_About_Games_A_Scientometric_Approach_to_Game_Studies_in_the_2000s","306283452_The_Pyrrhic_Victory_of_Game_StudiesAssessing_the_Past_Present_and_Future_of_Interdisciplinary_Game_Research","304493149_A_co-citation_bibliometric_analysis_of_strategic_management_research","292709102_The_business_and_culture_of_digital_games_Gameworkgameplay","281562509_Games_of_Empire_Global_Capitalism_and_Video_Games","251730641_The_structure_and_evolution_of_business-to-business_marketing_A_citation_and_co-citation_analysis","246531267_The_Introduction_to_the_Human_Sciences","241612850_Twenty-first_century_game_studies_in_the_academy_Libraries_and_an_emerging_discipline","238687478_Making_learning_fun_A_taxonomy_of_intrinsic_motivations_for_learning","238374519_What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy","234828783_Author_Cocitation_Analysis_Quantitative_Methods_for_Mapping_the_Intellectual_Structure_of_an_Academic_Discipline"]}
