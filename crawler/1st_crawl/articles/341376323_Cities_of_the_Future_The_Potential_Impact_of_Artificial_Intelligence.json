{"id":"341376323_Cities_of_the_Future_The_Potential_Impact_of_Artificial_Intelligence","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI), like many revolutionary technologies in human history, will have a profound impact on societies. From this viewpoint, we analyze the combined effects of AI to raise important questions about the future form and function of cities. Combining knowledge from computer science, urban planning, and economics while reflecting on academic and business perspectives, we propose that the future of cities is far from being a determined one and cities may evolve into ghost towns if the deployment of AI is not carefully controlled. This viewpoint presents a fundamentally different argument, because it expresses a real concern over the future of cities in contrast to the many publications who exclusively assume city populations will increase predicated on the neoliberal urban growth paradigm that has for centuries attracted humans to cities in search of work.","authors":["Eva Kassens-Noor","Arend Hintze"],"meta":["May 2020AI 1(2):192-197","DOI:10.3390/ai1020012"],"references":["340065787_Contributions_and_Risks_of_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_in_Building_Smarter_Cities_Insights_from_a_Systematic_Review_of_the_Literature","334607811_In_pursuit_of_being_smart_A_critical_analysis_of_India's_smart_cities_endeavor","334416672_Generating_a_Vision_for_Smart_Sustainable_City_of_the_Future_A_Scholarly_Backcasting_Approach","334075956_How_Smart_Cities_Became_the_Urban_Norm_Power_and_Knowledge_in_New_Songdo_City","331648499_The_Emergence_of_Anti-Privacy_and_Control_at_the_Nexus_between_the_Concepts_of_Safe_City_and_Smart_City","326152330_Can_our_cities_be_planned_Does_the_function_follow_the_form_The_New_York_experience","310666031_The_Ethical_City_A_Rationale_for_an_Urgent_New_Urban_Agenda","346239075_Smart_Technologies_of_the_Smart_City","331097271_Shaping_the_Future_of_the_Fourth_Industrial_Revolution","303553538_Millionaire_Migration_and_Taxation_of_the_Elite_Evidence_from_Administrative_Data"]}
