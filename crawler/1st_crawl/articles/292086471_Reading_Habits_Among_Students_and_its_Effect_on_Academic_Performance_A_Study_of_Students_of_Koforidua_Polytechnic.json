The study was conducted in Koforidua Polytechnic situated in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A questionnaire was used for the data collection. The data collected were analyzed quantitatively with the use of Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Figures and tables were used to present the results of findings. From the total of 1052 copies of questionnaire distributed, 1000 copies, representing 95.0% were filled and returned. The findings showed that majority of the respondents acknowledge the importance of reading, 81.9% of the respondents neither read novel nor fiction within the last two semesters while 62.0% of the respondents only read for the purpose of passing examination. The study confirmed that reading habit has influence on academic performance and there is a relationship between reading habit and academic performance. The study recommended among others that lecturers should be advised to stop providing handouts to students but rather encourage them to use the library for research and also, the current system of assessing students should be given a second thought with respect to the formulae of assessment.","authors":["Micheal Owusu-Acheaw","A.G.
