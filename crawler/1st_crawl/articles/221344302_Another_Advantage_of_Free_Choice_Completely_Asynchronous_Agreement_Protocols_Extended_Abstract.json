{"id":"221344302_Another_Advantage_of_Free_Choice_Completely_Asynchronous_Agreement_Protocols_Extended_Abstract","abstract":"Recently, Fischer, Lynch and Paterson [3] proved that no completely asynchronous consensus protocol can tolerate even a single unannounced process death. We exhibit here a probabilistic solution for this problem, which guarantees that as long as a majority of the processes continues to operate, a decision will be made (Theorem 1). Our solution is completely asynchronous and is rather strong: As in [4], it is guaranteed to work with probability 1 even against an adversary scheduler who knows all about the system.","authors":["Michael Ben-Or"],"meta":["January 1983","DOI:10.1145/800221.806707","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the second annual ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing"],"references":["220997642_On_the_Advantages_of_Free_Choice_A_Symmetric_and_Fully_Distributed_Solution_to_the_Dining_Philosophers_Problem","247204729_Polynomial_Algorithms_for_Byzantine_Agreement","242098745_Impossibility_of_Distributed_Consensus_with_One_Faulty_hocess","220114448_A_Lower_Bound_for_the_Time_to_Assure_Interactive_Consistency"]}
