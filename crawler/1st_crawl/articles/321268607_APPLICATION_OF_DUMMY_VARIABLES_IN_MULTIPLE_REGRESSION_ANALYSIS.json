{"id":"321268607_APPLICATION_OF_DUMMY_VARIABLES_IN_MULTIPLE_REGRESSION_ANALYSIS","abstract":"The target of any graduating student is to get a good and affordable placement after graduating from university. The purpose of this paper is to review the chance of getting successful placement. The paper \ntries to study the effect of three independent variables against a dependent variable i.e. cumulative grade point average (CGPA), types of job and engineering discipline against salary. The types of job under \nstudy are marketing, technical marketing, design and logistics. Electronics and communication, computer science and engineering, mechanical and electrical engineering are engineering discipline \nunder consideration. The concepts of multiple regression analysis using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used for the placementâ€™s review opportunities in relation to salary structure.","authors":["A. U.
