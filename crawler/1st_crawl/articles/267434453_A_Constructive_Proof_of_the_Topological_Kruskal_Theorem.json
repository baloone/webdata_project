{"id":"267434453_A_Constructive_Proof_of_the_Topological_Kruskal_Theorem","abstract":"We give a constructive proof of Kruskal’s Tree Theorem-precisely, of a topological extension of it. The proof is in the style of a constructive proof of Higman’s Lemma due to Murthy and Russell (1990), and illuminates the role of regular expressions there. In the process, we discover an extension of Dershowitz’ recursive path ordering to a form of cyclic terms which we call μ-terms. This all came from recent research on Noetherian spaces, and serves as a teaser for their theory.","authors":["Jean Goubault-Larrecq"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40313-2_3","Conference: International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science"],"references":["230715878_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","227323157_Well-foundedness_of_term_orderings","226769422_On_Boundedness_in_Depth_in_the_p-Calculus","220896850_Noetherian_Spaces_in_Verification","220444377_Nets_with_Tokens_Which_Carry_Data","29682367_A_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Monadic_Querying_of_Indefinite_Data_over_Linearly_Ordered_Domains","23992908_Forward_analysis_for_WSTS_Part_I_Completions","4263869_On_Noetherian_Spaces","2814951_An_intuitionistic_proof_of_Kruskal's_Theorem","2490095_Well-Founded_Recursive_Relations","350671895_Forward_Analysis_for_WSTS_Part_II_Complete_WSTS","274170098_Well-quasi-ordering_the_Tree_Theorem_and_Vazsonyi's_conjecture","268317252_Kruskal's_Tree_Theorem_in_a_Constructive_Theory_of_Inductive_Definitions","267660862_Well_Quasi-Ordered_Sets","267081205_Non-Hausdorff_topology_and_domain_theory_Selected_topics_in_point-set_topology","262255578_Multiset_rewriting_for_the_verification_of_depth-bounded_processes_with_name_binding","257282396_Interactive_theorem_proving_and_program_development_Coq'Art_The_Calculus_of_inductive_constructions","257145100_Jumping_and_escaping_Modular_termination_and_the_abstract_path_ordering","243764858_Finiteness_of_the_odd_perfect_and_primitive_abundant_numbers_with_n_distinct_prime_factors","243075390_Well-Quasi-Ordering_The_Tree_Theorem_and_Vazsonyi's_Conjecture","242381303_Attempts_for_generalizing_the_recursive_path_orderings","238717639_Ordering_by_Divisibility_in_Abstract_Algebras","230596087_On_well-quasi_ordering_infinite_trees","222850848_Parallel_program_schemata","222684215_Algorithmic_Analysis_of_Programs_with_Well_Quasi-ordered_Domains","222537668_Well-structured_transition_systems_everywhere","222504773_Natural_termination","222468095_Termination_of_rewriting","222455633_Orderings_for_term-rewriting_systems","221570345_Forward_Analysis_of_Depth-Bounded_Processes","221558415_A_General_Theorem_on_Termination_of_Rewriting","221186622_A_Constructive_Proof_of_Higman's_Lemma_in_Isabelle","220898058_Deciding_Safety_Properties_in_Infinite-State_Pi-Calculus_via_Behavioural_Types","220673648_Using_Forward_Reachability_Analysis_for_Verification_of_Lossy_Channel_Systems","220537939_An_effective_proof_of_the_well-foundedness_of_the_multiset_path_ordering","220247007_A_Well-Structured_Framework_for_Analysing_Petri_Nets_Extensions","220165656_Some_Properties_of_Decomposition_Ordering_a_Simplification_Ordering_to_Prove_Termination_of_Rewriting_Systems","220113500_A_Note_on_Simplification_Orderings","26645154_Karp-Miller_Trees_for_a_Branching_Extension_of_VASS","4085191_Vertor_Addition_Tree_Automata","3556201_Verifying_programs_with_unreliable_channels","3505250_A_constructive_proof_of_Higman's_lemma","2712723_Rewrite_Systems","2448946_A_proof_of_Higman's_lemma_by_structural_induction","2284968_The_Complexity_of_Querying_Indefinite_Data_about_Linearly_Ordered_Domains"]}
