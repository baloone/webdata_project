The aim of this paper is to study dynamics of relative superior tricorns and multicorns using -iteration schemes. Several examples are presented to explore the geometry of relative superior tricorns and multicorns for antipolynomial of complex polynomial for .\n\n1. Introduction\nIn 1918, French mathematician Julia [1] investigated the iteration process of complex function and attained a Julia set. On the other hand, the object Mandelbrot set was given by Mandelbrot [2]. In 1989, Crowe et al. [3] considered formal analogy with Mandelbrot set and named it “Mandelbrot sets” and showed its feature bifurcations along arcs rather than at points. The word “tricorn” was coined by Milnor for the connectedness locus for antiholomorphic polynomials , which plays an intermediate role between quadratic and cubic polynomials. Tricorn has many similarities with the Mandelbrot set due to a compact subset of .\nMilnor [4] found it in a real slice of the cubic connectedness locus. Winters [5] explained that boundary of the tricorn contains a smooth arc. The symmetries of tricorns and multicorns have been analyzed by Lau and Schleicher [6]. Nakane and Schleicher [7] presented various properties of tricorns and multicorns and quoted that the multicorns are the generalized tricorns or the tricorns of higher order. They also investigate that the Julia set of a polynomial of the form for is either connected or disconnected. The set of parameters such that the Julia set of is connected is called the multicorn. Tricorn prints, such as tricorn mugs and tricorn shirts, are being used for commercial purpose.\nThe dynamics of antiholomorphic complex polynomials for was studied and explored using Mann iteration by Rani [8, 9]. Relative superior tricorns and relative superior multicorns were introduced using Ishikawa iterates by Chauhan et al. [10]. Also, they studied their corresponding relative superior Julia sets.\nIn this paper we introduce and visualize a new class of relative superior tricorns and relative superior multicorns using -iteration scheme.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some basic definitions are presented. Section 3 contains the escape criterion for relative superior tricorns and multicorns. In Section 4, we generate relative superior tricorns and multicorns of -iteration scheme for quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic functions. At last, paper has been concluded in Section 5.\n\n2. Preliminaries\nDefinition 1 (see [11], multicorn). The multicorn for the quadratic function is defined as the collection of all for which the orbit of the point is bounded; that is, where is a complex space and is the th iterate of the function . An equivalent formulation is that the connectedness of loci for higher degree antiholomorphic polynomials is called multicorns.\nNotice that, at , multicorns reduce to tricorn. Moreover, the tricorn naturally lives in the real slice in the two-dimensional parameter space of maps . They have -fold rotational symmetries. Also, by dividing these symmetries, the resulting multicorns are called unicorns [7].\nDefinition 2 (see [12], -iteration scheme for relative superior tricorns and multicorns). Let be a subset of real or complex numbers and . For , one constructs the sequences and in in the following manner: where , , and , both are convergent to nonzero number.\nThe sequences and constructed above are called -iteration scheme sequences of iterations or relative superior sequences of iterates. We denote it by .\nDefinition 3 (Mandelbrot set). The Mandelbrot set consists of all parameters for which the filled Julia set of is connected; that is In fact, contains an enormous amount of information about the structure of Julia sets. The Mandelbrot set for the quadratic is defined as the collection of all for which the orbit of the point is bounded; that is, We choose the initial point , as is the only critical point of [11].\n\n3. Escape Criterion for Relative Superior Tricorns and Multicorns\nThe escape criterion plays an important role in the generation and analysis of relative superior tricorns and multicorns. We now obtain a general escape criterion for polynomials of the form .\nTheorem 4. For general function , , suppose that and , where , , and is a complex number. Define Then as . Thus the general escape criterion is .\nProof. We will use induction. For , we get , so the escape criterion is , which is obvious; that is, . For , we get so the escape criterion is . For , we get so the escape criterion is .\nNow suppose that theorem is true for any . Let and and exist. Then for , consider Also, for we obtain Since and it follows that and . It can be easily seen that which implies that Hence there exists such that . Consequently Hence as . So is the escape criterion. This completes the proof.\nCorollary 5. Suppose that and exist. Then the relative superior orbit of -iteration scheme escapes to infinity.\nCorollary 6. Assume that for some . Then and as .\nThis corollary provides an algorithm for computing the relative superior Mandelbrot sets for the functions of the form and also gives escape criterion to generate relative superior tricorns and multicorns.\n\n4. Generation of Relative Superior Tricorns and Multicorns\nWe generate relative superior tricorns and multicorns of -iteration scheme for quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic functions using software MAPLE.\n\n4.1.
