{"id":"328018530_Effectiveness_of_Fathom_on_Statistical_Reasoning_among_Form_Four_Students","abstract":"In this era, the rapid development of computer science and new technologies of information and communication is high hence there is need to introduce the concept of instructional software for teaching and learning statistical reasoning. This study aims at investigating the effectiveness of Fathom based Instruction in Enhancing Statistical Reasoning of Form Four Students. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent pretest-posttest study was conducted with a total of seventy-two form four students randomly assigned to a control group (n = 38) and an experimental group (n = 34). The experimental group was taught using dynamic software, Fathom; meanwhile the control group was taught without involving Fathom. The findings indicated there is a difference in the mean score of posttest between experimental and control groups. The posttest scores showed that students who learned statistical reasoning using Fathom outperformed those in the control group.","authors":["Nanteni Ganesan","Kwan Eu Leong"],"meta":["October 2018","Projects: Statistical reasoningIntention to Use Educational Technology"],"references":["278848453_Enhancing_Students'_Level_of_Geometric_Thinking_Through_Van_Hiele's_Phase-based_Learning","264869053_Rethinking_education_in_the_age_of_technology_the_digital_revolution_and_the_schools","254335984_Constructivism_as_a_Theoretical_Foundation_for_the_Use_of_Technology_in_Social_Studies","321451417_Statistical_Literacy_Reasoning_and_Learning_A_Commentary","318284052_The_co-emergence_of_aggregate_and_modelling_reasoning","306151908_Experimental_and_quasi-experimental_designs_for_research_on_teaching","291308916_Enhancing_Mathematics_Understanding_through_Visualization_The_Role_of_Dynamical_Software","271605970_Developing_students'_reasoning_about_samples_and_sampling_in_the_context_of_informal_inferences","250940746_The_Royal_Statistical_Society_Centre_For_Statistical_Education","247804736_The_Challenge_of_Developing_Statistical_Reasoning","246172073_Fathom_Dynamic_Data_Software","245508482_Assessment_in_Statistics_Education_Issues_and_Challenges","240801243_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Methods_in_Evaluation_Research","237731911_Inventing_to_Prepare_for_Future_Learning_The_Hidden_Efficiency_of_Encouraging_Original_Student_Production_in_Statistics_Instruction","229764725_Introducing_the_Emerging_Discipline_of_Statistics_Education"]}
