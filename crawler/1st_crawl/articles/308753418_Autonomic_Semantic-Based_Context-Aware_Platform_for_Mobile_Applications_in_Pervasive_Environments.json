{"id":"308753418_Autonomic_Semantic-Based_Context-Aware_Platform_for_Mobile_Applications_in_Pervasive_Environments","abstract":"Currently, the field of smart (home, city, health, tourism, etc.) is naturally heterogeneous and multimedia oriented. In such a domain, there is an increasing usage of heterogeneous mobile devices, as well as captors transmitting data (IoT). They are highly connected and can be used for many different services, such as to monitor, to analyze and to display information to users. In this context, data management and adaptation in real time are becoming a challenging task. More precisely, at one time, it is necessary to handle in a dynamic, intelligent and transparent framework various data provided by multiple devices with several modalities. This paper presents a Kali-Smart platform, which is an autonomic semantic-based context-aware platform. It is based on semantic web technologies and a middleware providing autonomy and reasoning facilities. Moreover, Kali-Smart is generic and, as a consequence, offers to users a flexible infrastructure where they can easily control various interaction modalities of their own situations. An experimental study has been made to evaluate the performance and feasibility of the proposed platform.","authors":["Alti Adel","Abderrahim Lakehal","SÃ©bastien Laborie","Philippe Roose"],"meta":["September 2016Future Internet 8(4):48","DOI:10.3390/fi8040048","Project: A Vehicular Ad hoc Networks(VANET) based cloud"],"references":["308831875_Cloud_semantic-based_dynamic_multimodal_platform_for_building_mhealth_context-aware_services","305525061_Consistent_Unanticipated_Adaptation_for_Context-Dependent_Applications","303911867_WComp_Middleware_for_Ubiquitous_Computing_and_System_Focused_Adaptation","278798198_SMPMA_Semantic_multimodal_Profile_for_Multimedia_documents_adaptation","271891312_On-the-fly_Multimedia_Document_Adaptation_Architecture","265842243_Rafiki_A_Semantic_and_Collaborative_Approach_to_Community_Health-Care_in_Underserved_Areas","265215707_SenSocial_A_Middleware_for_Integrating_Online_Social_Networks_and_Mobile_Sensing_Data_Streams","264611783_Dynamic_semantic-based_adaptation_of_multimedia_documents","259163171_SHERLOCK_Semantic_management_of_Location-Based_Services_in_wireless_environments","286956195_WComp_Middleware_for_Ubiquitous_Computing_and_System_Focused_Adaptation"]}
