In this paper, we investigate the fuzzy generalization of: x→(y→z)≡(x→y)→(x→z) law. More precisely, we will show under which conditions such Boolean-like law holds for the following classes of fuzzy implications: (S,N)-, R-, QL-, D-, (T,N)- and H. To achieve that we introduce a new fuzzy property called Distributivity over De Morgan. Finally, we will show that a fuzzy implication I satisfies such Boolean-like law if, and only if, it is also satisfied by its Φ-conjugate.","authors":["Anderson Cruz","Benjamin Bedregal","Regivan H N Santiago"],"meta":["November 2017International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 93","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2017.11.004"],"references":["273319231_Many-Valued_Logic","263974583_On_the_Boolean-like_Law_Ix_Iy_x_1","228759996_Xor-Implications_and_E-Implications_Classes_of_Fuzzy_Implications_Based_on_Fuzzy_Xor","228454645_Analyzing_the_Relationship_between_Interval-valued_D-Implications_and_Interval-valued_QL-Implications1","221399368_An_Approach_to_Interval-Valued_R-Implications_and_Automorphisms","221399197_On_Iterative_Boolean-Like_Laws_of_Fuzzy_Sets","220245256_A_Characterization_of_Classic-Like_Fuzzy_Semantics","3336561_On_the_Law_of_Importation_in_Fuzzy_Logic","3336204_On_the_Distributivity_of_Implication_Operators_Over_T_and_S_Norms","312445317_QL-operations_and_QL-implication_functions_constructed_from_tuples_OGN_and_the_generation_of_fuzzy_subsethood_and_entropy_measures","300929995_AXIOMATIC_APPROACH_TO_IMPLICATION_FOR_APPROXIMATE_REASONING_WITH_FUZZY_LOGIC","282400794_A_review_of_the_relationships_between_implication_negation_and_aggregation_functions_from_the_point_of_view_of_material_implication","279346380_Fuzzy_Preference_Modelling_and_Multicriteria_Decision_Support","261467687_The_law_x_Iy_X_and_the_three_main_classes_of_fuzzy_implications","256721160_Interval_representations_Lukasiewicz_implicators_and_Smets-Magrez_axioms","243703308_On_some_functionally_expressable_implications_for_fuzzy_set_theory","243688476_Fuzzy_power_sets_and_fuzzy_implication_operators","243628774_Axiomatic_approach_to_implication_for_approximate_reasoning_with_fuzzy_logic","242128206_QL-implications_versus_D-implications","239227658_Sobre_funciones_de_negacion_en_la_teoria_de_conjuntos_difuso","232965089_On_measures_of_fuzziness_and_fuzzy_complements","229880376_On_contra-symmetry_and_MPT_conditionality_in_fuzzy_logic","229344360_Relating_De_Morgan_triples_with_Atanassov's_intuitionistic_De_Morgan_triples_via_automorphisms","229209287_Residual_implications_revisited_Notes_on_the_Smets-Magrez_Theorem","228832245_On_the_Metamathematics_of_Fuzzy_Logic","228831672_Associative_functions_and_statistical_triangle_inequalities","228829902_Statistical_Metrics","226520607_Wahrscheinlichkeitslogik","223584681_A_general_concept_of_fuzzy_connectives_negations_and_implications_based_on_t-norms_and_t-conorms","222473865_A_survey_on_different_triangular_norm-based_fuzzy_logics","222449832_Applicability_of_the_fuzzy_operators_in_the_design_of_fuzzy_logic_controllers","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","222412386_On_interval_fuzzy_negations","222384222_Automorphisms_negations_and_implication_operators","221212014_Solutions_of_Equation_Ixy_IxIxy_for_Implications_Derived_from_Uninorms","220693863_The_fuzzy_systems_handbook_a_practitioner's_guide_to_building_using_and_maintaining_fuzzy_systems","220527979_QL-implications_Some_properties_and_intersections","220406332_A_normal_form_which_preserves_tautologies_and_contradictions_in_a_class_of_fuzzy_logics","220315251_On_Notation_for_Ordinal_Numbers","220314090_On_a_new_class_of_fuzzy_implications_H-Implications_and_generalizations","220310931_On_fuzzy_complements","220310709_On_some_new_classes_of_implication_operators_and_their_role_in_approximate_reasoning","27412832_On_the_characterizations_of_fuzzy_implications_satisfying_Ixy_Ix_Ixy","7190728_Statistical_Metrics","3336024_On_the_law_pqrprVqr_in_fuzzy_logic","3335727_Andrews_JE_Combinatorial_rule_explosion_eliminated_by_a_fuzzy_rule_configuration_IEEE_Trans_Fuzzy_Syst_61_1-11"]}
