{"id":"323501114_How_Data_Will_Transform_Industrial_Processes_Crowdsensing_Crowdsourcing_and_Big_Data_as_Pillars_of_Industry_40","abstract":"We are living in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, namely Industry 4.0. This paper presents themain aspects related to Industry 4.0, the technologies thatwill enable this revolution, and the main application domains thatwill be affected by it. The effects that the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), crowdsensing, crowdsourcing, cloud computing and big data will have on industrial processeswill be discussed. Themain objectiveswill be represented by improvements in: production efficiency, quality and cost-effectiveness; workplace health and safety, as well as quality of working conditions; products' quality and availability, according to mass customisation requirements. The paper will further discuss the common denominator of these enhancements, i.e., data collection and analysis. As data and information will be crucial for Industry 4.0, crowdsensing and crowdsourcing will introduce new advantages and challenges, which will make most of the industrial processes easier with respect to traditional technologies.","authors":["Virginia Pilloni"],"meta":["March 2018Future Internet 10(3):24","DOI:10.3390/fi10030024","Project: Building Energy and Comfort Management Systems"],"references":["320635598_Industrial_Big_Data_in_an_Industry_40_Environment_Challenges_Schemes_and_Applications_for_Predictive_Maintenance","320343294_Industry_40_implications_in_logistics_an_overview","320166902_Editorial_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_I2oT","318293848_IoT-enabled_Smart_Factory_Visibility_and_Traceability_Using_Laser-scanners","318074423_Industrial_Process_Monitoring_in_the_Big_DataIndustry_40_Era_from_Detection_to_Diagnosis_to_Prognosis","323485753_The_future_and_social_impact_of_Big_Data_Analytics_in_Supply_Chain_Management_Results_from_a_Delphi_study","319971538_An_Efficient_Industrial_Big-Data_Engine","319683392_Remote_Control_of_Large_Manufacturing_Plants_Using_Core_Elements_of_Industry_40","319193581_Provably_Secure_Identity-Based_Signcryption_Scheme_for_Crowdsourced_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_Environments","318647301_The_Internet_of_People_IoP_A_new_wave_in_pervasive_mobile_computing"]}
