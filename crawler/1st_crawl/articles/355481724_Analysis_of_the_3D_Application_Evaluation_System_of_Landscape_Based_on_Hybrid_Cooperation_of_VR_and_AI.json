{"id":"355481724_Analysis_of_the_3D_Application_Evaluation_System_of_Landscape_Based_on_Hybrid_Cooperation_of_VR_and_AI","abstract":"The traditional urban landscape planning and design method cannot integrate the design into the whole planning scene and cannot express the planning effect of multiple schemes and large scenes in an efficient, intuitive, and coordinated way. With the development of computer science and technology, virtual reality technology based on AI is playing an important role in many aspects of urban landscape planning and design. In this paper, on the basis of 3D visualization landscape planning and design, 3D visualization urban landscape modeling is carried out using VR combined with the constructed deep neural network (DNN) to establish a 3D database and virtual scene model of the landscape, and 3D representation of the virtual scene landscape is realized. The designed solution allows the user to grab the object and release it into the workspace. If any placement is needed, the user can pick up the layer again and move it to a new location. Finally, the simulation experiment and its result analysis were conducted to effectively analyze the site of the real model and its matching rate, to realize the integration of the 3D image, 3D stereo, and system integration technology, and to finally complete the landscape design task.","authors":["Lina Niu","Feng Han"],"meta":["October 2021Scientific Programming 2021","DOI:10.1155/2021/4595808"],"references":["354079542_Research_on_3D_urban_landscape_design_and_evaluation_based_on_geographic_information_system","351221547_Spotting_Football_Events_Using_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Neural_Network_and_Dilated_Recurrent_Neural_Network","350460744_Identification_of_Intrinsically_Disordered_Protein_Regions_Based_on_Deep_Neural_Network-VGG16","345382619_Research_on_Urban_Land_Price_Assessment_Based_on_Artificial_Neural_Network_Model","341326980_The_Future_of_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_and_Machine_Learning_ML_in_Landscape_Design_A_Case_Study_in_Coastal_Virginia_USA","351970238_Color_Effect_of_Landscape_Architecture_Design_under_Computer_Aided_Collaborative_Design_System","351968659_Color_Effect_of_Low-Cost_Plant_Landscape_Design_Under_Computer-Aided_Collaborative_Design_System","348005746_Differences_in_movement_limitations_in_different_low_back_pain_severity_in_functional_tests_using_an_RGB-D_camera","347897005_Camera-based_Basketball_Scoring_Detection_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network","343309169_AI_Safety_Landscape_From_short-term_specific_system_engineering_to_long-term_artificial_general_intelligence","340961593_Multiple_player_tracking_in_basketball_court_videos","340270376_The_AI_techno-economic_complex_System_Worldwide_landscape_thematic_subdomains_and_technological_collaborations","340065787_Contributions_and_Risks_of_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_in_Building_Smarter_Cities_Insights_from_a_Systematic_Review_of_the_Literature","340245686_Systematizing_heterogeneous_expert_knowledge_scenarios_and_goals_via_a_goal-reasoning_artificial_intelligence_agent_for_democratic_urban_land_use_planning","340235120_Tuning_martensitic_transformations_via_coherent_second_phases_in_nanolaminates_using_free_energy_landscape_engineering"]}
