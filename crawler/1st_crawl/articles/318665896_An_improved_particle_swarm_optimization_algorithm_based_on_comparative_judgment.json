{"id":"318665896_An_improved_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_based_on_comparative_judgment","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is one of the most effective and popular swarm intelligence algorithms. In this paper, based on comparative judgment, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is proposed. Firstly, a new search equation is developed by considering individual experience, social experience and the integration of individual and social experience, which can be used to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. Secondly, in order to avoid falling into a local optima, a location abandoned mechanism is proposed; meanwhile, a new equation to generate a new position for the corresponding particle is proposed. The experimental results show that IPSO algorithm has excellent solution quality and convergence characteristic comparing to basic PSO algorithm and performs better than some state-of-the-art algorithms on almost all tested functions.","authors":["Chun-Feng Wang","Kui Liu"],"meta":["September 2018Natural Computing 17(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11047-017-9630-5"],"references":["291419369_A_Novel_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Global_Optimization","288315252_A_Modified_Immune_Network_Optimization_Algorithm","282954195_Binary_Cuckoo_Search_Algorithm_for_Band_Selection_in_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","305523757_A_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Minimum_Generating_Set_Problem","303635754_A_novel_differential_evolution_algorithm_using_local_abstract_convex_underestimate_strategy_for_global_optimization","290711197_HPSOM_A_hybrid_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_with_genetic_mutation","288258099_Adaptive_mutation_particle_swarm_optimization","283662060_A_novel_stability-based_adaptive_inertia_weight_for_particle_swarm_optimization","270825478_Adaptive_acceleration_coefficients_for_a_new_search_diversification_strategy_in_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithms","263667557_Superior_solution_guided_particle_swarm_optimization_combined_with_local_search_techniques","266597321_Adaptive_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_with_dynamically_changing_inertia_weight","265337909_Search_performance_improvement_of_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_by_second_best_particle_information","264871845_Simulated_Annealing_Driven_Pattern_Search_Algorithms_for_Global_Optimization","264005916_A_novel_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_with_Levy_flight"]}
