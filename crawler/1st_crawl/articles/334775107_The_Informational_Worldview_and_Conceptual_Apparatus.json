{"id":"334775107_The_Informational_Worldview_and_Conceptual_Apparatus","abstract":"The chapter relates to the thought of the Lvov-Warsaw School in a very contemporary way, because it refers to computer science. In section 1, starting from the declarations of selected representatives of the School (including Kazimierz Twardowski and Władysław Tatarkiewicz), we will specify the relation between the worldview and philosophy as a feedback taking place in time. In sections 2 and 3, we will characterize the conceptual apparatus of computer science (it consists of such terms as information, computing, algorithm, computability and uncomputability), and then we will explain some preliminary assumptions of the informational worldview. These are the following assumptions: (i) each being has a certain information content, (ii) a human mind is an information processing system, and (iii) with the development of human civilization, the complexity of problems solved by the mind (through information processing) keeps increasing. In section 4, we will present for discussion the philosophical concept of Marciszewski (one of the contemporary continuators of the School), which refers to the assumption of (iii), and is one of the possible informational worldviews.","authors":["Paweł Stacewicz"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-24486-6_14","In book: Interdisciplinary Investigations into the Lvov-Warsaw School (pp.259-280)"],"references":["332075921_The_progress_of_science_from_a_computational_point_of_view_The_drive_towards_ever_higher_solvability","315437334_Informational_Worldview_Scientific_Foundations_and_Philosophical_Perspectives","276511994_On_Accelerations_in_Science_Driven_by_Daring_Ideas_Good_Messages_from_Fallibilistic_Rationalism","220424434_The_Many_Facets_of_Natural_Computing","324459442_Computer_Science_and_its_Relation_to_Mathematics","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","285117994_Birth_of_Joho_Shakai_and_Johoka_concepts_in_Japan_and_their_diffusion_outside_Japan","279958039_Artificial_Intelligence","246528594_Introduction_to_Neural_Artificial_Systems","243775087_Mathematical_theory_of_the_differential_analyzer","233821506_The_Universal_History_of_Numbers_From_Prehistory_to_the_Invention_of_the_Computer","226460163_Hypercomputation","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","222396916_Real_recursive_functions_and_their_hierarchy","222300005_The_many_forms_of_hypercomputation","220695059_Genetic_AlgorithmData_StructuresEvolution_Programs","220425905_Is_computer_science_science","37028094_Wybrane_pisma_filozoficzne","30870613_Algorithmics_The_Spirit_of_Computing"]}
