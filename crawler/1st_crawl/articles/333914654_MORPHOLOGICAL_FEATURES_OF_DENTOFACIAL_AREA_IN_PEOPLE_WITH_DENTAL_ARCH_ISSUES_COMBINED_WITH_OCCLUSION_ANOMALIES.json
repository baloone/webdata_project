Nowadays, there is an increased interest taken by patients in their own appearance as well as in the structural features of the facial part of their heads. Another issue currently faced by the dentistry is the growing prevalence of dentofacial anomalies and deformities among various population groups. The etiological factors behind anomalies and deformities include dental system congenital and acquired pathologies, and especially dental arch defects . The effect of the dental arches pathology on the craniofacial status has been proven in numerous works written by clinical experts [8, 9]. It has been noted that the timely treatment and preventive measures offered to patients with dental arches defects through different age periods, has a beneficial effect on the growth, development and condition not only of the masticatory system, yet also on the adjacent organs and body systems . Given the above, studying maxillofacial morphology in people with dental arch defects will remain an urgent issue for dentistry","authors":["Sergey Fischev","Marina Puzdyryova","Sergey Dmitrienko","Dmitry Domenyuk"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.35630/2199-885X/2019/9/1/162"],"references":["342116642_MATHEMATIC_SIMULATION_FOR_UPPER_DENTAL_ARCH_IN_PRIMARY_TEETH_OCCLUSION","334855998_DENTOALVEOLAR_SPECIFICS_IN_CHILDREN_WITH_CLEFT_PALATE_DURING_PRIMARY_OCCLUSION_PERIOD","334819276_Major_telerenthengogram_indicators_in_people_with_various_growth_types_offacial_area","334689219_Odontometric_indices_fluctuation_in_people_with_physiological_occlusion","334562324_BIOMETRY_OF_PERMANENT_OCCLUSION_DENTAL_ARCHES_-_COMPARISON_ALGORITHM_FOR_REAL_AND_DESIGN_INDICATORS","334552886_NON-REMOVABLE_ARCH_ORTHODONTIC_APPLIANCES_FOR_TREATING_CHILDREN_WITH_CONGENITAL_MAXILLOFACIAL_PATHOLOGIES_-_EFFICIENCY_EVALUATION","334552713_IMPROVING_ODONTOMETRIC_DIAGNOSTICS_AT_JAW_STONE_MODEL_EXAMINATION","334550031_DIAGNOSTIC_VALUE_OF_CEPHALOMETRIC_PARAMETERS_AT_GRAPHIC_REPRODUCTION_OF_TOOTH_DENTAL_ARCHES_IN_PRIMARY_TEETH_OCCLUSION","330286608_Types_off_acial_heart_depth_in_physiological_occlusion","324672215_Anatomical_features_of_the_interdependence_of_the_basic_parameters_of_the_dental_arches_of_the_upper_and_lower_jaws_of_man"]}
