{"id":"323027396_Rediseno_curricular_de_la_Carrera_de_Ingenieria_Forestal_en_la_Universidad_Estatal_del_Sur_de_Manabi_Ecuador","abstract":"Ecuador is one of the 17 countries in the world with the greatest diversity, covering forests approximately 44.50% of its territory. However, between 1990 and 2015, deforestation reached 2,083,000 ha. In correspondence with this and considering that universities must face the challenge of having curricula adapted to the needs of the environment, this work had the objective of redesigning the curriculum of the Forestry Engineering Career at the Southern State University of Manabí, Ecuador. To fulfill this purpose, a non-experimental design was applied, using the method of analysis and synthesis, through field and documentary research. As a result, the relevance study, the macro-curriculum, the mission and vision of the career were obtained, as well as the meso-curriculum and the micro-curriculum. The redesign complies with the regulations established at the national level, the needs of the context and international standards.","authors":["Msc Otto","Francisco Mero","Msc Mónica","Virginia Tapia"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.6084/m9.figshare.5881285.v1"],"references":["316378334_ARTICULACION_DOCENCIA_INVESTIGACION_Y_VINCULACION_CON_LA_SOCIEDAD_PARA_LA_GESTION_DE_LA_AGROBIODIVERSIDAD","250987888_Teoria_pesquisa_e_pratica_em_Educacao_a_formacao_do_professor-pesquisador","28230817_Competencias_genericas_y_formacion_profesional_un_analisis_desde_la_docencia_universitaria"]}
