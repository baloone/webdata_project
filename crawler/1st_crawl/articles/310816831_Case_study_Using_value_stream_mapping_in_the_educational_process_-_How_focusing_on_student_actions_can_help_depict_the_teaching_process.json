{"id":"310816831_Case_study_Using_value_stream_mapping_in_the_educational_process_-_How_focusing_on_student_actions_can_help_depict_the_teaching_process","abstract":"Although many lean higher education efforts have focussed on administrative/support services and processes, only a few actual applications of lean methods have been meant for teaching, which is the core business of higher education. The absence of experiments and research in these contexts has challenged us to apply lean to our own undergraduate course. We have paid special attention in this experiment to the use of Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to depict teaching process, the shortcomings of VSM and the use of service blueprinting.","authors":["Lejla Brouwer Hadzialic","Vincent Wiegel"],"meta":["January 2016International Journal of Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage 10(1):50","DOI:10.1504/IJSSCA.2016.080451"],"references":[]}
