{"id":"329544316_Introductory_Programming_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"As computing becomes a mainstream discipline embedded in the school curriculum and acts as an enabler for an increasing range of academic disciplines in higher education, the literature on introductory programming is growing. Although there have been several reviews that focus on specific aspects of introductory programming,there has been no broad overview of the literature exploring recent trends across the breadth of introductory programming.\nThis paper is the report of an ITiCSE working group that conducted a systematic review in order to gain an overview of the introductory programming literature. Partitioning the literature into papers addressing the student, teaching, the curriculum, and assessment, we explore trends, highlight advances in knowledge over the past 15 years, and indicate possible directions for future research.","authors":["Andrew Luxton-Reilly","Ibrahim Albluwi","Brett A Becker","Michail Giannakos"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1145/3293881.3295779"],"references":["325077237_The_Hidden_Person_within_the_Frustrated_Student_An_Interpretative_Phenomenological_Analysis_of_a_Student's_Experience_in_a_Programming_Course","345925483_Cementing_Abstraction_With_A_Concrete_Application_A_Focused_Use_Of_Robotics_In_Cs1","345151000_Comprehending_Studies_on_Program_Comprehension","344839675_Real-time_Monitoring_of_Student_Procrastination_in_a_PSI_First-year_Programming_Course","344540120_JavaGrinder_A_Web-Based_Platform_for_Teaching_Early_Computing_Skills","339856562_The_Multiplayer_Classroom_Designing_Coursework_as_a_Game","328368829_Validity_in_educational_psychological_assessment","327268676_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_on_Teaching_and_Learning_Introductory_Programming_in_Higher_Education","325080907_An_Analysis_of_Incorporating_Small_Coding_Exercises_as_Homework_in_Introductory_Programming_Courses","325072994_Student_Perceptions_of_Their_Abilities_and_Learning_Environment_in_Large_Introductory_Computer_Programming_Courses"]}
