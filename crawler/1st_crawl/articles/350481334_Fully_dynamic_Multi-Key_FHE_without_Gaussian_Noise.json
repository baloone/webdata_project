{"id":"350481334_Fully_dynamic_Multi-Key_FHE_without_Gaussian_Noise","abstract":"Fully dynamic multi-key fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) that allows an unlimited number of homomorphic operations for unconstrained parties. That is to say, it supports performing as many computational procedures on inputs (which are encrypted by an unrestricted number of parties) as needed. The existed fully dynamic multi-key FHE scheme is based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem. However, the LWE problem suffers from the intricate and laborious Gaussian sampling which extremely weakens the schemes’ efficiencies. What’s more, it has been lately revealed that Gaussian sampling creates lots of possible side-channel vulnerabilities that result in the disclosure of secret keys. The paper proposed a fully dynamic multi-key FHE that based on the learning with rounding (LWR) problem which leaves out the time-consuming Gaussian sampling required in the LWE problem while sustaining almost the same security level.","authors":["Yu Huang","Kaigui Wu","Ming Chen"],"meta":["March 2021IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069214"],"references":["335542873_Achieving_One-Round_Password-based_Authenticated_Key_Exchange_over_Lattices","324725496_LWR-Based_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Revisited","274654361_Post-Quantum_Key_Exchange_for_the_TLS_Protocol_from_the_Ring_Learning_with_Errors_Problem","309302653_Multi-key_FHE_from_LWE_Revisited","305810992_Flush_Gauss_and_Reload_-_A_Cache_Attack_on_the_BLISS_Lattice-Based_Signature_Scheme","305782105_On_the_Hardness_of_Learning_with_Rounding_over_Small_Modulus","305472408_Lattice-Based_Fully_Dynamic_Multi-key_FHE_with_Short_Ciphertexts","301670743_Two_Round_Multiparty_Computation_via_Multi-key_FHE","290883644_Multi-identity_and_Multi-key_Leveled_FHE_from_Learning_with_Errors","267441252_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Learning_with_Errors_Conceptually-Simpler_Asymptotically-Faster_Attribute-Based"]}
