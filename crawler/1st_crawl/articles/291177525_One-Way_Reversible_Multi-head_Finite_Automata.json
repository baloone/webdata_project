{"id":"291177525_One-Way_Reversible_Multi-head_Finite_Automata","abstract":"One-way multi-head finite automata are considered towards their ability to perform reversible computations. It is shown that, for every number k â‰¥ 1 of heads, there are problems which can be solved by one-way k-head finite automata, but not by any one-way reversible k-head finite automaton. Additionally, a proper head hierarchy is obtained for one-way reversible multi-head finite automata. Finally, decidability problems are considered. It turns out that one-way reversible finite automata with two heads are still a powerful model, since almost all commonly studied problems are not even semidecidable.","authors":["Martin Kutrib","Andreas Malcher"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-36315-3_2","Conference: International Workshop on Reversible Computation"],"references":["222555759_Reversible_Computation_and_Reversible_Programming_Languages","262400213_Reversible_Multi-head_Finite_Automata_Characterize_Reversible_Logarithmic_Space","262328345_States_and_Heads_Do_Count_for_Unary_Multi-head_Finite_Automata","234829070_On_Multi-head_Finite_Automata","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","224105116_Irreversibility_and_Heat_Generation_in_the_Computing_Process","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","222783480_Reversing_Algebraic_Process_Calculi","222126229_Fast_reversible_language_recognition_using_cellular_automata","221467314_Descriptional_Complexity_of_Cellular_Automata_and_Decidability_Questions","220980146_On_Reversible_Automata","220897886_Reversible_Flowchart_Languages_and_the_Structured_Reversible_Program_Theorem","220520642_Descriptional_Complexity_of_Cellular_Automata_and_Decidability_Questions","220443533_Two-Way_Reversible_Multi-Head_Finite_Automata","220432484_Inference_of_Reversible_Languages","220431014_k_1_Heads_Are_Better_than_k","220197312_On_Non-Determinancy_in_Simple_Computing_Devices","220155351_Reversible_computing_and_cellular_automata_-_A_survey","220148403_Real-time_reversible_iterative_arrays"]}
