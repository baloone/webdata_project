{"id":"323520911_Knowledge_Generation_for_Regional_Competitive_Advantage","abstract":"Management of intangible assets to generate new synergies emerge as an important factor for knowledge activities (Connell and Voola, 2007; Heavin and Adam, 2012). Corporate social responsibility activities (CSR) are accepted as a way of managing intangible assets and aligning organizational values to knowledge management (Pandey and Dutta, 2013). CSR can involve bringing together social responsibility projects and innovation and using social engagement as a strategic instrument for knowledge generation (Maxfield, 2008). In this paper, the authors argue that investing in a regional strategic CSR project and combining it with innovative elements may enable new interactions across sectors for the generation of new knowledge. A case study is conducted focusing on the software giant SAP and a model is proposed to analyze SAP's corporate culture, its emergence and its effect on the type of CSR activities for knowledge generation and the formation of human capital with an emphasis to the future.","authors":["Burak Erkut","Tugberk Kaya"],"meta":["September 2017","Conference: 18th European Conference on Knowledge Management (ECKM 2017)At: Barcelona, Spain","Project: Product Innovation and Market Shaping from the Perspective of Evolutionary Economics"],"references":["262873618_Role_of_knowledge_infrastructure_capabilities_in_knowledge_management","260557312_Measuring_Corporate_Social_Responsibility_for_Competitive_Success_at_a_regional_level","220363133_Strategic_alliances_and_knowledge_sharing_Synergies_or_silos","303287214_Perceiving_Innovation_Who_'Makes'_SAP_Labs_India_and_How","227391671_Contingency_and_Causality_in_Economic_Processes_-_Conceptualizations_Formalizations_and_Applications_in_Counterfactual_Analysis","45140035_How_Corporate_Cultures_Coevolve_with_the_Business_Environment_The_Case_of_Firm_Growth_Crises_and_Industry_Evolution","5149238_Reconciling_Corporate_Citizenship_and_Competitive_Strategy_Insights_from_Economic_Theory"]}
