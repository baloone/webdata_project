{"id":"288060069_Optimal_Sample_Complexity_for_Blind_Gain_and_Phase_Calibration","abstract":"Blind gain and phase calibration (BGPC) is a structured bilinear inverse\nproblem, which arises in many applications, including inverse rendering in\ncomputational relighting (albedo estimation with unknown lighting), blind phase\nand gain calibration in sensor array processing, and multichannel blind\ndeconvolution. The fundamental question of the uniqueness of the solutions to\nsuch problems has been addressed only recently. In a previous paper, we\nproposed studying the identifiability in bilinear inverse problems up to\ntransformation groups. In particular, we studied several special cases of blind\ngain and phase calibration, including the cases of subspace and joint sparsity\nmodels on the signals, and gave sufficient and necessary conditions for\nidentifiability up to certain transformation groups. However, there were gaps\nbetween the sample complexities in the sufficient conditions and the necessary\nconditions. In this paper, under a mild assumption that the signals and models\nare generic, we bridge the gaps by deriving tight sufficient conditions with\noptimal sample complexities.","authors":["Yanjun Li","Kiryung Lee","Yoram Bresler"],"meta":["December 2015IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 64(21)","DOI:10.1109/TSP.2016.2598311","SourcearXiv"],"references":["282758078_Calibrating_Nested_Sensor_Arrays_With_Model_Errors","276296204_Identifiability_in_Blind_Deconvolution_with_Subspace_or_Sparsity_Constraints","271448325_A_Unified_Framework_for_Identifiability_Analysis_in_Bilinear_Inverse_Problems_with_Applications_to_Subspace_and_Sparsity_Models","283675767_Uniqueness_in_bilinear_inverse_problems_with_applications_to_subspace_and_joint_sparsity_models","258813869_Subspace_Methods_for_Computational_Relighting","258792206_A_Hadamard_Product_Based_Method_for_DOA_Estimation_and_Gain-Phase_Error_Calibration","225023454_Contrast-Based_Phase_Calibration_for_Remote_Sensing_Systems_With_Digital_Beamforming_Antennas","224737162_Direction_of_arrival_estimation_by_eigenstructure_methods_with_unknown_sensor_gain_and_phase","224657447_Eigenstructure_methods_for_direction_finding_with_sensor_gain_and_phase_uncertainties","224209716_Blind_Calibration_for_a_Linear_Array_With_Gain_and_Phase_Error_Using_Independent_Component_Analysis"]}
