{"id":"318285225_A_Survey_of_Algorithms_for_Calculating_Power_Indices_of_Weighted_Majority_Games","abstract":"This paper deals with the weighted majority game, which is a familiar example of voting systems. In 1960s, U.S. Supreme Court handed down a series of \"one person one vote\" decisions. After that, calculations of power indices using real data were carried out and presented as evidence in the courtroom. For example, the courts in New York State have accepted the Banzhaf index (also called the Coleman value or Chow parameters) as an appropriate measure for weighted voting systems. The calculation normally requires the aid of a computer and so many counties in U.S. hire specialized consultants, mathematicians or computer scientists (see [13]). 1 In this paper, we discuss some algorithms for calculating power indices. In Section 2, we define weighted majority games and related concepts. Section 3 defines three power indices, the Shapley-Shubik power index, the Banzhaf index and the Deegan-Packel index. Section 4 shows complexity classes of the problems for calculating power indices","authors":["Tomomi Matsui","Yasuko Matsui"],"meta":["November 2000Journal of the Operations Research Society of Japan 43(1):71-86","DOI:10.15807/jorsj.43.71"],"references":["321564268_Political_and_Related_Models","313672585_Multilinear_extensions_of_games","313645872_An_efficient_algorithm_for_determining_the_convex_hull_of_a_finite_planar_set","313124372_A_method_for_evaluating_the_distribution_of_power_in_a_committee_system","284289939_A_Value_for_n-Person_Games","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","265441677_Nucleoluses_of_Compound_Simple_Games","256181708_Graham_RL_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Determining_the_Convex_Hull_of_a_Finite_Planar_Set_Information_Processing_Letters_1_132-133","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","243575519_Values_of_large_games"]}
