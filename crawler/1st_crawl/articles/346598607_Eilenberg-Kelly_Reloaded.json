{"id":"346598607_Eilenberg-Kelly_Reloaded","abstract":"The Eilenberg-Kelly theorem states that a category C with an object I and two functors ⊗:C×C→C and ⊸:Cop×C→C related by an adjunction −⊗B⊣B⊸− natural in B is monoidal iff it is closed and moreover the adjunction holds internally. We dissect the proof of this theorem and observe that the necessity for a side condition on closedness arises because the standard definition of closed category is left-skew in regards to associativity. We analyze Street's observation that left-skew monoidality is equivalent to left-skew closedness and establish that monoidality is equivalent to closedness unconditionally under an adjusted definition of closedness that requires normal associativity. We also work out a definition of right-skew closedness equivalent to right-skew monoidality. We give examples of each type of structure; in particular, we look at the Kleisli category of a left-strong monad on a left-skew closed category and the Kleisli category of a lax closed monad on a right-skew closed category. We also view skew and normal monoidal and closed categories as special cases of skew and normal promonoidal categories and take a brief look at left-skew prounital-closed categories.","authors":["Tarmo Uustalu","Niccolò Veltri","Noam Zeilberger"],"meta":["October 2020Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 352(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2020.09.012"],"references":["329575156_The_Sequent_Calculus_of_Skew_Monoidal_Categories","324055429_A_sequent_calculus_for_a_semi-associative_law","351279941_Natural_Associativity_and_Commutativity","348631722_Proof_Theory_of_Partially_Normal_Skew_Monoidal_Categories","326028524_A_theory_of_linear_typings_as_flows_on_3-valent_graphs","323707969_The_Mathematics_of_Sentence_Structure","322048992_Braided_skew_monoidal_categories","321967087_Free_skew_monoidal_categories","319210122_Skew_monoidal_categories_and_skew_multicategories","316801430_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics"]}
