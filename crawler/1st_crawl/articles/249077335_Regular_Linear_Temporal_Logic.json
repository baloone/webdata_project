{"id":"249077335_Regular_Linear_Temporal_Logic","abstract":"We present regular linear temporal logic (RLTL), a logic that generalizes linear temporal logic with the ability to use regular expressions arbitrarily as sub-expressions. Every LTL operator can be defined as a context in regular linear temporal logic. This implies that there is a (linear) translation from LTL to RLTL.\nUnlike LTL, regular linear temporal logic can define all ω-regular languages, while still keeping the satisfiability problem in PSPACE. Unlike the extended temporal logics \\(\\text{ETL}_*\\), RLTL is defined with an algebraic signature. In contrast to the linear time μ-calculus, RLTL does not depend on fix-points in its syntax.","authors":["Martin Leucker","Cesar Sanchez"],"meta":["September 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-75292-9_20","Conference: Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Theoretical aspects of computing"],"references":["234785237_The_complexity_of_propositional_linear_temporal_logics_Journal_of_the_ACM_JACM_323_733-749","307962645_Representation_of_Events_in_Nerve_Nets_and_Finite_Automata","284100771_Symposium_on_Decision_Problems_On_a_Decision_Method_in_Restricted_Second_Order_Arithmetic","247813821_THE_COMPLEXITY_OF_PROPOSITIONAL_LINEAR_TIME_LOGIC","239607818_Characterizing_properties_of_parallel_programs_as_fixpoints","229124270_Representation_of_Events_in_Nerve_Nets_and_Finite_Automata","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","226340286_Applications_of_temporal_logic_to_the_specification_and_verification_of_reactive_systems_A_survey_of_current_trends","222717812_Temporal_logic_can_be_more_expressive","222504369_Dynamic_Linear_Time_Temporal_Logic"]}
