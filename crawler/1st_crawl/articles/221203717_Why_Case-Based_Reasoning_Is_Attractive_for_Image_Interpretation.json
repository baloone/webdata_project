{"id":"221203717_Why_Case-Based_Reasoning_Is_Attractive_for_Image_Interpretation","abstract":"The development of image interpretation systems is concerned with tricky problems such as a limited number of observations, environmental influence, and noise. Recent systems lack robustness, accuracy, and flexibility. The introduction of case-based reasoning (CBR) strategies can help to overcome these drawbacks. The special type of information (i.e., images) and the problems mentioned above provide special requirements for CBR strategies. In this paper we review what has been achieved so far and research topics concerned with case-based image interpretation. We introduce a new approach for an image interpretation system and review its components.","authors":["Petra Perner"],"meta":["July 2001Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/3-540-44593-5_3","SourceDBLP","Conference: Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, 4th International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning, ICCBR 2001, Vancouver, BC, Canada, July 30 - August 2, 2001, Proceedings"],"references":["250171630_Optical_character_recognition_an_illustrated_guide_to_the_frontier","249736455_A_Comparative_Study_of_String_Dissimilarity_Measures_in_Structural_Clustering","321596599_Performance_Characterization_in_Computer_Vision","312977263_IEEE_Transactions_on_Pattern_Analysis_and_Machine_Intelligence","263155818_A_New_Metric_for_Grey-Scale_Image_Comparison","251782162_Image_analysis_and_classification_of_HEp2_cells_in_fluorescent_images","244186114_Using_CBR_Learning_for_the_Low-Level_and_High-Level_Unit_of_a_Image_Interpretation_System","239667269_A_rule-rule-case_based_system_for_image_analysis","236626861_Quadratic_Convergence_in_a_Primal-Dual_Method","226877478_CBR_for_the_Reuse_of_Image_Processing_Knowledge_a_Recursive_RetrievalAdaptation_Strategy"]}
