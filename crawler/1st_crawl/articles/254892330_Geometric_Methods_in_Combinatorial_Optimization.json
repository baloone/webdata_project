{"id":"254892330_Geometric_Methods_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","abstract":"This paper is a somewhat polished-up form of the lecture notes for the instructional series of talks given by L. Lovasz. This series was based on a forthcoming book by the three authors, which discusses combinatorial applications of the ellipsoid method and other algorithms, most of which have a geometric flavor.\n\nIn this paper we take the opportunity to illuminate some of the problems one encounters when trying to develop and apply geometric algorithms, and to show some of the results which are easiest to state, without going into too many technical details. Some of these details can be found in the papers [GLS 1981 a], [GLS 1981 b], others will be elaborated in the book. In particular, we do not go into the description of the Ellipsoid Method (Shor 1970, Yudin - Nemirowskii 1976, Khachiyan 1979), since this is by now quite well known.","authors":["Martin Grötschel","Lovász László","A.
