{"id":"226688856_A_superhigh_diamond_in_the_ce_tt-degrees","abstract":"The notion of superhigh computably enumerable (c.e.) degrees was first introduced by (Mohrherr in Z Math Logik Grundlag Math\n32: 5–12, 1986) where she proved the existence of incomplete superhigh c.e. degrees, and high, but not superhigh, c.e. degrees.\nRecent research shows that the notion of superhighness is closely related to algorithmic randomness and effective measure\ntheory. Jockusch and Mohrherr proved in (Proc Amer Math Soc 94:123–128, 1985) that the diamond lattice can be embedded into\nthe c.e. tt-degrees preserving 0 and 1 and that the two atoms can be low. In this paper, we prove that the two atoms in such embeddings\ncan also be superhigh.\n\nKeywordsComputably enumerable sets–Truth-table degrees–Superhighness–Lattice embeddings","authors":["Douglas Cenzer","Johanna N.
