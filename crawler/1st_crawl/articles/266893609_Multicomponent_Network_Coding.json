{"id":"266893609_Multicomponent_Network_Coding","abstract":"In this paper, we propose so-called multicomponent codes with the prescribed subspace metric distance. This class is a generaliza-tion of the Silva-KÃ¶tter-Kschischang construction (SKK codes). Compo-nent constructions are chosen in such a manner that subspace distance between components would be not less than subspace distance of each component. Iterative decoding algorithm is proposed. A few examples are given.","authors":["Ernst Gabidulin","Nina I Pilipchuk"],"meta":["April 2011"],"references":["224578732_Construction_and_Covering_Properties_of_Constant-Dimension_Codes","1744497_Error-Correcting_Codes_in_Projective_Spaces_Via_Rank-Metric_Codes_and_Ferrers_Diagrams","1738069_Recursive_Code_Construction_for_Random_Networks","226827086_Linear_Authentication_Codes_Bounds_and_Constructions","225727377_Algebraic_codes_for_network_coding","224578269_One_family_of_algebraic_codes_for_network_coding","224324771_Codes_for_Network_Coding","3087016_A_Rank-Metric_Approach_to_Error_Control_in_Random_Network_Coding","3084691_Linear_authentication_codes_Bounds_and_constructions"]}
