{"id":"327055656_Discussing_climate_change_online_Topics_and_perceptions_in_online_climate_change_communication_in_different_online_public_arenas","abstract":"How users discuss climate change online is one of the crucial questions (science) communication scholars address nowadays. This study contributes by approaching the issue through the theoretical concept of online public arenas. The diversity of topics and perceptions in the climate change discourse is explored by comparing different arenas. German journalistic articles and their reader comments as well as scientific expert blogs are analyzed by quantitative manual and automated content analysis (n=5,301). Findings demonstrate a larger diversity of topics and interpretations in arenas with low barriers to communication. Overall, climate change skepticism is rare, but mostly present in lay publics.","authors":["Ines LÃ¶rcher","Monika Taddicken"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Science Communication 16(02)","DOI:10.22323/2.16020203"],"references":["293860773_Tracking_the_release_of_IPCC_AR5_on_Twitter_Users_comments_and_sources_following_the_release_of_the_Working_Group_I_Summary_for_Policymakers","284348981_Wie_Journalisten_mit_Ungewissheit_umgehen_Eine_Untersuchung_am_Beispiel_der_Berichterstattung_uber_die_Folgen_des_Klimawandels","283551286_RTextTools_A_Supervised_Learning_Package_for_Text_Classification","282610817_Climate_change_on_Twitter_Content_media_ecology_and_information_sharing_behaviour","276421914_Examining_User_Comments_for_Deliberative_Democracy_A_Corpus-driven_Analysis_of_the_Climate_Change_Debate_Online","285887660_The_climate_sceptics","285081555_The_role_of_new_media_in_engaging_the_public_with_climate_change","283992721_The_virtual_sphere_20_The_internet_the_public_sphere_and_beyond","279187547_Designing_qualitative_research","276421613_Climate_Change_Communication_and_the_Internet_Challenges_and_Opportunities_for_Research"]}
