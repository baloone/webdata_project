{"id":"257743661_Verifying_regional_climate_model_results_with_web-based_expert-system","abstract":"The verification system aims at monitoring the forecast quality over time. Verification helps improving the forecast quality by knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the existing forecasting system and by comparing the quality of different forecasting methodologies. Thus, the web-based verification system has been developed for verification of forecast results that is produced by International Center for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model v4 for our country. The forecasters and analysts can analyze the data in real-time with this web-based system. In this study, model values obtained from the system provided by ULAKBIM High Performance and Grid Computing Center. Model and station values were compared with each other for verification of model results with observation values. Therefore model grid values are transferred to station by using bi-linear and nearest neighbor (k-NN) (proximal) interpolation methods. This process in meteorological literature is called grid to point technique. Verification methods for forecasts of continuous variables are used to verify forecast values with observation values. Some verification methods; Mean Error, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error, are calculated for validation. Verification results are shown as table and graphics on web-based system which is developed by the power of PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor).","authors":["Emrullah Sonuç","Baha Sen","Burak Şen"],"meta":["December 2012Procedia Technology 1:24–30","DOI:10.1016/j.protcy.2012.02.007"],"references":["284148794_E-confidence_or_incompetence_Are_teachers_ready_to_teach_in_the_21st_century","253946198_The_Developmental_Testbed_Center_Verification_System"]}
