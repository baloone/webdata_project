{"id":"268646279_On_the_Logic_of_Hypothesis_Generation","abstract":"It has been argued in the introductory chapter to this volume that, when dealing with non-deductive reasoning forms like abduction and induction, a distinction between hypothesis generation and hypothesis evaluation arises. Hypothesis generation is concerned with hypotheses that are not yet ruled out by the data, and is as such a purely logical process. Hypothesis evaluation then proceeds with further investigating the possible hypotheses in order to select one of which the predictions agree sufficiently with reality. This distinction has been inspired by Peirceâ€™s later, inferential theory of abduction, deduction and induction as the three stages of scientific inquiry.","authors":["Peter A.
