{"id":"279870373_Evolutionary_Computation_and_Genetic_Programming","abstract":"This chapter focuses on evolutionary computation, in particular genetic programming, as examples of drawing inspiration from biological systems. We set the choice of evolution as a source for inspiration in context and discuss the history of evolutionary computation and its variants before looking more closely at genetic programming. After a discussion of methods and the state of the art, we review application areas of genetic programming and its strength in providing human-competitive solutions.","authors":["Wolfgang Banzhaf"],"meta":["June 2013","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-415995-2.00017-9","In book: Engineered Biomimicry (pp.429-447)"],"references":["262400261_Evolutionary-computer-assisted_design_of_image_operators_that_detect_interest_points_using_genetic_programming","258478724_Application_of_Genetic_Programming_for_Estimation_of_Soil_Compaction_Parameters","249562088_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Visual_Art_and_Music","238195783_BEAGLE_A_Darwinian_approach_to_pattern_recognition","234827613_High_performance_genetic_programming_on_GPU","234493407_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics","228352437_Genetic_programming_on_GPUs_for_image_processing","226464365_Accelerating_Genetic_Programming_through_Graphics_Processing_Units","226096470_An_Evolved_Antenna_for_Deployment_on_Nasa's_Space_Technology_5_Mission","225612742_Open_issues_in_Genetic_Programming","225575501_GP_on_SPMD_parallel_graphics_hardware_for_mega_Bioinformatics_data_mining","225169493_Using_enhanced_genetic_programming_techniques_for_evolving_classifiers_in_the_context_of_medical_diagnosis","224084255_A_Survey_on_the_Application_of_Genetic_Programming_to_Classification","221009241_Boolean_Functions_Fitness_Spaces","221009225_Robustness_Evolvability_and_Accessibility_in_Linear_Genetic_Programming","220955102_State-of-the-Art_Genetic_Programming_for_Predicting_Human_Oral_Bioavailability_of_Drugs","220741095_Evolution_development_and_learning_using_self-modifying_cartesian_genetic_programming","220739878_Genetic_programming_for_finite_algebras","220702202_An_Evolutionary_Approach_to_Modeling_Radial_Brightness_Distributions_in_Elliptical_Galaxies","220286141_Evolution_of_human-competitive_lossless_compression_algorithms_with_GP-zip2","220285903_Theoretical_results_in_genetic_programming_The_next_ten_years","284862639_Cognitive_systems_based_in_adaptive_algorithms_In_Waterman_DA_Hayes-Roth_F_eds_Pattern-directed_inference_systems_Academic_Press","263526097_A_Bibliography_of_Genetic_Algorithm_Business_Application_Research_1988-June_1996","257564573_Evolutionary_dynamics_on_multiple_scales_A_quantitative_analysis_of_the_interplay_between_genotype_phenotype_and_fitness_in_linear_genetic_programming","257001666_Application_of_genetic_programming_to_the_calibration_of_industrial_robots","243763994_A_learning_machine_Part_I","235709846_Human-competitive_results_produced_by_genetic_programming","229559747_A_Bibliography_of_Genetic_Algorithm_Business_Application_Research_1988-June_1996","229548921_Trading_and_hedging_in_SP_500_spot_and_futures_markets_using_genetic_programming","227139333_Repeated_patterns_in_genetic_programming","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","223945878_Applications_of_Genetic_Programming_in_Cancer_Research","222707422_The_quality_of_institutions_A_genetic_programming_approach","222672390_Genetic_Programming_and_Rough_Sets_A_Hybrid_Approach_to_Bankruptcy_Classification","222573787_Object_detection_in_multi-modal_images_using_genetic_programming","222186674_Sea_water_level_forecasting_using_genetic_programming_and_comparing_the_performance_with_Artificial_Neural_Networks","221009260_Grammatical_Evolution_Evolving_Programs_for_an_Arbitrary_Language","221009118_A_Many_Threaded_CUDA_Interpreter_for_Genetic_Programming","221007622_Genetic_programming_for_edge_detection_A_global_approach","220885624_Using_the_Genetic_Algorithm_to_Generate_LISP_Source_Code_to_Solve_the_Prisoner's_Dilemma","220815053_Hierarchical_Genetic_Algorithms_Operating_on_Populations_of_Computer_Programs","220741903_A_genetic_programming_approach_to_automated_software_repair","220431151_Outline_for_a_Logical_Theory_of_Adaptive_Systems","220375002_A_ComDarison_of_Selection_Schemes_Used_in_Evolutionary_Algorithms","220306804_Evolving_blackbox_quantum_algorithms_using_genetic_programming","220286071_GP-Gammon_Genetically_Programming_Backgammon_Players","220285890_Introduction_to_Special_Section_on_Evolutionary_Computation_in_Games","220219396_Application_of_genetic_programming_for_modelling_of_material_characteristics","220216416_An_application_of_the_genetic_programming_technique_to_strategy_development","220199449_Genetic_programming_for_QSAR_investigation_of_docking_energy","220070992_Search_Based_Software_Engineering_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue_of_the_IEEE_Transactions_on_Software_Engineering","22518867_Interaction_of_critical_periods_in_the_kitten_visual_cortex","220151001_Ant_colony_optimization_theory_A_survey","26459208_Forecasting_tourist_arrivals_to_Balearic_Islands_using_genetic_programming","23568439_Texture_Segmentation_by_Genetic_Programming"]}
