{"id":"314259623_Computation_of_some_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","abstract":"Chemical graph theory is a branch of graph theory whose focus of interest is to finding topological indices of chemical graphs which correlate well with chemical properties of the chemical molecules. In this paper, we compute the modified first and second Zagreb indices, harmonic index and augmented Zagreb index for certain networks like silicate networks and honeycomb networks.","authors":["V.
