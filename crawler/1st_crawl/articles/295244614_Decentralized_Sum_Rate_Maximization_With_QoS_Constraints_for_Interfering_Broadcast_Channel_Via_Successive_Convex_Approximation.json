{"id":"295244614_Decentralized_Sum_Rate_Maximization_With_QoS_Constraints_for_Interfering_Broadcast_Channel_Via_Successive_Convex_Approximation","abstract":"Weighted sum rate maximization (WSRMax) with\nuser specific quality-of-service (QoS) constraints and general\nconvex transmit power constraints is considered in multi-cell\nmulti-user multiple-input multiple-output system. The particular\nfocus in the proposed joint transmitter-receiver design is on\ntractability in terms of implementation and moderately fast\nchanging/time correlated channel conditions. The non-convex\ntransmit precoder design problem is formulated as a difference of\nconvex functions program, for which a locally optimal solution is\nachieved by successive convex approximation (SCA). To achieve\npractically realizable designs, two decentralized approaches with\nlow signaling overhead are proposed. Primal decomposition\nbased solution provides better compliance of the provided QoS\nconstraints in slowly fading channel conditions. On the other\nhand, solution based on Lagrangian relaxation of the coupling\nrate constraints is proposed for relaxed feasibility conditions and\nimproved convergence properties. As a special case, an iterative\nsolution via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the precoder\ndesign problem with per base station transmit power constraints\nis also proposed. Finally, we propose a heuristic extension of the\nSCA method, which is shown to significantly improve the rate of\nconvergence while achieving comparable sum rate with recently\npublished methods.","authors":["Jarkko Kaleva","Antti TÃ¶lli","Markku J.
