{"id":"336529963_Requirements_and_Limitations_of_Thermal_Drones_for_Effective_Search_and_Rescue_in_Marine_and_Coastal_Areas","abstract":"Search and rescue (SAR) is a vital line of defense against unnecessary loss of life. However, in a potentially hazardous environment, it is important to balance the risks associated with SAR action. Drones have the potential to help with the efficiency, success rate and safety of SAR operations as they can cover large or hard to access areas quickly. The addition of thermal cameras to the drones provides the potential for automated and reliable detection of people in need of rescue. We performed a pilot study with a thermal-equipped drone for SAR applications in Morecambe Bay. In a variety of realistic SAR scenarios, we found that we could detect humans who would be in need of rescue, both by the naked eye and by a simple automated method. We explore the current advantages and limitations of thermal drone systems, and outline the future path to a useful system for deployment in real-life SAR.","authors":["Claire Burke","Paul Ross Mcwhirter","Josh Veitch-Michaelis","Owen McAree"],"meta":["October 2019Drones 3(4)","DOI:10.3390/drones3040078","Project: Astro-ecology"],"references":["331374779_Thermal-Drones_as_a_Safe_and_Reliable_Method_for_Detecting_Subterranean_Peat_Fires","330347081_Accurate_fast_data_efficient_and_interpretable_glaucoma_diagnosis_with_automated_spatial_analysis_of_the_whole_cup_to_disc_profile","329390751_Optimising_observing_strategies_for_monitoring_animals_using_drone-mounted_thermal_infrared_cameras","326957145_Impact_of_dataset_size_and_variety_on_the_effectiveness_of_deep_learning_and_transfer_learning_for_plant_disease_classification","326356352_Using_Deep_Learning_and_Low-Cost_RGB_and_Thermal_Cameras_to_Detect_Pedestrians_in_Aerial_Images_Captured_by_Multirotor_UAV","326226078_Addressing_environmental_and_atmospheric_challenges_for_capturing_high-precision_thermal_infrared_data_in_the_field_of_astro-ecology","324422904_Unmanned_aerial_vehicles_drones_to_prevent_drowning","323673171_Drones_for_Provision_of_Flotation_Support_in_Simulated_Drowning","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","315349423_First_Report_of_Using_Portable_Unmanned_Aircraft_Systems_Drones_for_Search_and_Rescue"]}
