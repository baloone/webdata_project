{"id":"280104695_Millimeter-wave_Gbps_Broadband_Evolution_towards_5G_Fixed_Access_and_Backhaul","abstract":"As wireless communication evolves towards 5G, both fixed broadband and mobile\nbroadband will play a crucial part in providing the Gbps infrastructure for a\nconnected society. This paper proposes a Millimeter-wave Gbps Broadband (MGB)\nsystem as the solution to two critical problems in this evolution: last-mile\naccess for fixed broadband and small cell backhaul for mobile broadband. The\nkey idea is to use spectrum that is already available in the millimeter wave\nbands for fixed wireless access with optimized dynamic beamforming and massive\nMIMO infrastructure to achieve high capacity with wide area coverage. This\npaper explains the MGB concept and describes potential array architectures for\nrealizing the system. Simulations demonstrate that with 500 MHz of bandwidth\n(at 39 GHz band) and 28 dBm transmission power (55 dBm EIRP), it is possible to\nprovide more than 11 Gbps backhaul capacity for 96 small cells within 1-km\nradius.","authors":["Zhouyue Pi","Junil Choi","Robert W.
