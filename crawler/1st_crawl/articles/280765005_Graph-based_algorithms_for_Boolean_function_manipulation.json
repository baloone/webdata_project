{"id":"280765005_Graph-based_algorithms_for_Boolean_function_manipulation","abstract":"A data structure is presented for representing Boolean functions and an associated set of manipulation algorithms. Functions are represented by directed, acyclic graphs in a manner similar to the representations introduced by C. Y. Lee (1959) and S. B. Akers (1978), but with further restrictions on the ordering of decision variables in the graph. Although, in the worst case, a function requires a graph where the number of vertices grows exponentially with the number of arguments, many of the functions encountered in typical applications have a more reasonable representation. The algorithms have time complexity proportional to the sizes of the graphs being operated on, and hence are quite efficient as long as the graphs do not grow too large. Experimental results are presented from applying these algorithms to problems in logic design verification that demonstrate the practicality of the approach.","authors":["Randal E.
