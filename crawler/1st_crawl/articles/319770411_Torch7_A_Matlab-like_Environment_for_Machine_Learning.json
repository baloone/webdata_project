{"id":"319770411_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning","abstract":"Torch7 is a versatile numeric computing framework and machine learning library that extends Lua. Its goal is to provide a flexible environment to design and train learning machines. Flexibility is obtained via Lua, an extremely lightweight scripting language. High performance is obtained via efficient OpenMP/SSE and CUDA implementations of low-level numeric routines. Torch7 can easily be in- terfaced to third-party software thanks to Lua's light interface.","authors":["Ronan Collobert","Koray Kavukcuoglu","Clement Farabet"],"meta":["January 2011","Conference: BigLearn NIPS Workshop"],"references":[]}
