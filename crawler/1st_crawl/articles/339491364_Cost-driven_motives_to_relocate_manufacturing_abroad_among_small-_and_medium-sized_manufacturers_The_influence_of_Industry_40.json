{"id":"339491364_Cost-driven_motives_to_relocate_manufacturing_abroad_among_small-_and_medium-sized_manufacturers_The_influence_of_Industry_40","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of how Industry 4.0 related technologies affect the relocation of manufacturing abroad by small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper contains an empirical analysis of how Industry 4.0 related technologies affect the cost-driven relocation of manufacturing abroad based on 191 comprehensive and full responses to a questionnaire survey distributed in 2018 among small- and medium-sized Danish manufacturers.\n\nFindings\nThis paper builds upon data, which reveals that companies' pursuit of cost-focused competitive strategies is positively correlated with relocating manufacturing abroad. However, the data also shows that the more Industry 4.0-ready decision-makers are, the less cost-focused strategy drives manufacturing abroad. Furthermore, perceived barriers to Industry 4.0 related technologies promote the cost-driven relocation of manufacturing abroad whereas perceived drivers decrease this phenomenon.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis paper is based on the answers given by a single respondent from each company and only on Danish respondents.\n\nPractical implications\nThe results indicate a need to invest resources to obtain a better knowledge of Industry 4.0 related technologies when used in processes involved in decisions about where to locate manufacturing.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper contains new, empirically founded information about how Industry 4.0 related technologies affect the cost-driven relocation of manufacturing abroad from the perspective of small- and medium-sized manufacturers.","authors":["Jan Stentoft","Kent Adsbøll Wickstrøm","Anders Haug","Kristian Philipsen"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management
