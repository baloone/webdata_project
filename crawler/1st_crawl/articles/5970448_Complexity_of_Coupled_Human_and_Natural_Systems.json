{"id":"5970448_Complexity_of_Coupled_Human_and_Natural_Systems","abstract":"Integrated studies of coupled human and natural systems reveal new and complex patterns and processes not evident when studied\nby social or natural scientists separately. Synthesis of six case studies from around the world shows that couplings between\nhuman and natural systems vary across space, time, and organizational units. They also exhibit nonlinear dynamics with thresholds,\nreciprocal feedback loops, time lags, resilience, heterogeneity, and surprises. Furthermore, past couplings have legacy effects\non present conditions and future possibilities.","authors":["Jianguo Liu","Thomas Dietz","Stephen R.
