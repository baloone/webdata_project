{"id":"341788606_Comparisons_of_Blockchain_based_Consensus_Algorithms_for_Security_Aspects","abstract":"The blockchain is a relatively new technology in the field of computer science. It has received enhanced interests in recent years for Research and Scientific Industry. As its first implementation attention is crypto-currency. Blockchain provides as an immutable distributed ledger which performs transactions with untrusted participants in a decentralized network. It forms a new distributed architectures, which has no central authority and has smart contracts to shared states and perform transactions. Blockchain applications are crypto-currency based online wallets, Internet of Things, springing up, financial services, risk management, reputation system, etc. This paper aims to share knowledge on the growing importance of blockchain technology in real-world applications. This paper also focused on Blockchain core components and technologies to lay out the comparisons of typical Consensus Algorithm for security aspects. This comparison and blockchain applications concludes that alternative Merkel tree based blockchains are available in the market for faster and secure transactions.","authors":["Mansi Bosamia","Patel"],"meta":["June 2020","Project: Blockchain"],"references":["328338366_Blockchain_challenges_and_opportunities_A_survey","327601654_Current_Trends_and_Future_Implementation_Possibilities_of_the_Merkel_Tree","318131748_An_Overview_of_Blockchain_Technology_Architecture_Consensus_and_Future_Trends","327074319_IoT_Architectures_based_on_Blockchain_Technologies","321727643_The_security_and_financial_implications_of_blockchain_technologies_Regulating_emerging_technologies_in_Canada","228640975_Bitcoin_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System"]}
