{"id":"263208455_A_Nationwide_Survey_of_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment_and_Dementia_Including_Very_Mild_Dementia_in_Taiwan","abstract":"An increasing population of dementia patients produces substantial societal impacts. We assessed the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and all-cause dementia, including very mild dementia (VMD), in Taiwan. In a nationwide population-based cross-sectional survey, participants were selected by computerized random sampling from all 19 Taiwan counties and were enrolled between December 2011 and March 2013. Cases were identified through in-person interviews based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association clinical criteria. Demographic data and histories involving mental status and function in daily living were collected. The principal objective assessments were the Taiwanese Mental Status Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating. In all, 10,432 people aged 65 years or older (mean age 76.2Â±6.7, 52.3% women) were interviewed. The age-adjusted prevalence of all-cause dementia was 8.04% (95% CI 7.47-8.61), including a 3.25% (95% CI 2.89-3.61) prevalence of VMD; that of MCI was 18.76% (95% CI 17.91-19.61). Women had a higher prevalence than men of both all-cause dementia (9.71% vs. 6.36%) and MCI (21.63% vs. 15.57%). MCI affects a considerable portion of the population aged 65 and above in Taiwan. The inclusion of VMD yields dementia prevalence rates higher than those previously reported from Taiwan. Old age, female gender, and a low educational level are significant associated factors.","authors":["Yu Sun","Huey-Jane Lee","Shu-Chien Yang","Ta-Fu Chen"],"meta":["June 2014PLoS ONE 9(6):e100303","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0100303","SourcePubMed"],"references":["265214403_Psychiatric_Symptoms_in_Individuals_Reverting_to_Normal_Cognition_from_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment","239942420_Prevalence_Studies_of_Dementia_in_Mainland_China_Hong_Kong_and_Taiwan_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","234100254_Trends_in_Alzheimer's_Disease_and_Dementia_in_the_Asian-Pacific_Region","232612215_Trends_in_the_Prevalence_of_Dementia_in_Japan","295699791_Prevalence_of_Cognitive_Impairment_Without_Dementia_vol_148_pg_427_2008","288262176_The_diagnosis_of_dementia_due_to_Alzheimer's_disease_Recommendations_from_the_National_Institute_on_Aging_and_the_Alzheimer's_Association_workgroup","286751767_Epidemiology_of_dementia_in_Taiwan","285153282_The_diagnosis_of_mild_cognitive_impairment_due_to_Alzheimer's_disease_Recommendations_from_the_National_Institute_on_Aging_and_Alzheimer's_Association_workgroup","252931896_Epidemiology_of_Alzheimer's_disease_and_other_forms_of_dementia_in_China_1990-2010_A_systematic_review_and_analysis","235416576_Alzheimer_disease_in_the_United_States_2010-2050_estimated_using_the_2010_Census"]}
