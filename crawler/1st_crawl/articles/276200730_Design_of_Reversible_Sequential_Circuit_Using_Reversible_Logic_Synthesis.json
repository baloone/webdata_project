{"id":"276200730_Design_of_Reversible_Sequential_Circuit_Using_Reversible_Logic_Synthesis","abstract":"Reversible logic is one of the most vital issue at present time and it has different areas for its application,those are low power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotechnology, cryptography, optical computing, DNA computing, digital signal processing (DSP), quantum dot cellular auto meta, communication, computer\ngraphics. It is not possible to realize quantum computing without implementation of reversible logic. The main purposes of designing reversible logic are to decrease quantum cost, depth of the circuits and the number of garbage outputs. In this paper, we have proposed a new reversible gate. And we have designed\nRS flip flop and D flip flop by using our proposed gate and Peres gate. The proposed designs are better than the existing proposed ones in terms of number of reversible gates and garbage outputs. So, this realization is more efficient and less costly than other realizations.","authors":["Ali Md Belayet"],"meta":["December 2011International Journal of VLSI Design and Communication Systems 2(4):37-45","DOI:10.5121/vlsic.2011.2404"],"references":["267383153_Optimized_Reversible_carry_select_BCD_adders_using_Reversible_logic_gates","228357393_A_beginning_in_the_reversible_logic_synthesis_of_sequential_circuits","312628416_Logical_reversibility_of_computation","287135226_Irreversibility_and_heat_generation_in_the_computing_process","255754617_Design_of_a_Reversible_Parallel_Loading_Shift_Register","226483600_Quantum_Mechanical_Computers","226418586_Conservative_Logic","225508024_Reversible_computing","224699712_Fault-Tolerant_Reversible_Circuits","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation"]}
