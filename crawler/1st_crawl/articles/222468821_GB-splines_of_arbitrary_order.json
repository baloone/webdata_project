{"id":"222468821_GB-splines_of_arbitrary_order","abstract":"Explicit formulae and recurrence relations for the calculation of generalized B-splines (GB-splines) of arbitrary order are given. We derive main properties of GB-splines and their series, i.e. partition of unity, shape-preserving properties, invariance with respect to affine transformations, etc. It is shown that such splines have the variation diminishing property and are Chebyshevian splines.","authors":["Boris I.
