{"id":"308570161_Classification_of_classic_Turkish_music_makams_by_using_deep_belief_networks","abstract":"Automatic classification of makams from sound data is a challenging yet rarely studied topic. In this work, it is aimed to develop an MIR system which determines a song's makam. To overcome this problem, mel frequency cepstral coefficients were utilized as features. Five classifiers were considered. The best result was obtained by deep belief network as 93.10 which is comparable to the recent works.","authors":["Merve Ayyuce Kizrak","BÃ¼lent Bolat"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1109/INISTA.2016.7571850","Conference: IEEE 2016 International Symposium on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)At: Romania","Project: music retrevial"],"references":["303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","275037555_Destek_Vektor_Makineleri_Ile_Uydu_Goruntulerinin_Siniflandirilmasinda_Kernel_Fonksiyonlarinin_Etkilerinin_Incelenmesi","267295661_INCORPORATING_FEATURES_OF_DISTRIBUTION_AND_PROGRESSION_FOR_AUTOMATIC_MAKAM_CLASSIFICATION","266153735_Klasik_Turk_Muzigi_Makamlarinin_Taninmasi","266144631_Classification_of_Classic_Turkish_Music_Makams","277294722_A_Neural_Network_Approach_for_Predicting_Network_Resource_Requirement_in_Video_Transmission_Systems","267984810_Moving_beyond_feature_design_Deep_architectures_and_automatic_feature_learning_in_music_informatics","267229654_FEATURES_FOR_ANALYSIS_OF_MAKAM_MUSIC","263725306_Computational_Analysis_of_Turkish_Makam_Music_Review_of_State-of-the-Art_and_Challenges","263725188_A_Hierarchical_Approach_to_Makam_Classification_of_Turkish_Makam_Music_Using_Symbolic_Data"]}
