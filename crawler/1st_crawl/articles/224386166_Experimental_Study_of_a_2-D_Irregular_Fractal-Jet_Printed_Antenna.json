{"id":"224386166_Experimental_Study_of_a_2-D_Irregular_Fractal-Jet_Printed_Antenna","abstract":"In this letter, a two-dimensional (2-D) irregular fractal-jet printed antenna is designed and characterized. The measured return loss over the range 1-30 GHz shows multiband behavior with various impedance widths and matching. The radiation patterns and the gain were measured at some resonating frequencies. The antenna radiation is influenced by the high irregularity of the patch boundary.","authors":["Hatem Rmili","Jean Marie Floch","Habib Zangar"],"meta":["February 2009IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters 8:328 - 331","DOI:10.1109/LAWP.2009.2015223","SourceIEEE Xplore","Project: fractal antenna"],"references":["253400123_Structure_and_dynamics_of_round_turbulent_jets","241349093_Study_of_an_Electrochemically-Deposited_3D-Fractal_Tree_Monopole_Antenna","236123894_Study_of_an_electrochemically-deposited_3D-fractal_tree_dipole_antenna","284438553_The_Fractal_Geometry_of_Nature_Benoit_B_Mandelbrot","231859109_On_the_geometry_of_homogeneous_turbulence_with_stress_on_the_fractal_dimension_of_the_iso-surfaces_of_scalars","229472885_Multiband_characteristics_of_two_fractal_antennas","226876098_Experimental_analysis_of_liquid-gas_interface_at_low_Weber_number_Interface_length_and_fractal_dimension","224761494_The_Irregular-Shaped_Fractal_Antennas_for_Ultra_Wideband_Radio_Systems","223130325_The_Fractal_Geometry_of_Nature","220241656_BroadbandMultiband_Printed_Antennas"]}
