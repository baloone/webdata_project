{"id":"332794276_The_Relationship_between_the_Emotional_Intelligence_of_Iranian_EFL_Learners_and_Their_Performance_on_the_Listening_Section_of_IELTS","abstract":"This study was an attempt to explore the role of emotional intelligence on the whole and its components particularly problem solving in EFL learnersâ€™ listening comprehension performance in the IELTS tests. For this purpose, a total of 39 advanced learners homogenized according to Oxford Placement Test took part in this study. Participants completed the IELTS listening tests and were asked to fill out the Bar-On emotional intelligence questionnaire. The obtained quantitative data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Results indicated a non-significant correlation between the whole EI scores and listening performance of learners. There were, however, a significant relationship between problem solving and EI. The social responsibility component of EI was also found to have a significant relationship with listening. The findings are discussed with regard to the role of the IELTS test as a standardized test and the high level of learners. Implications and suggestions for further research are presented.","authors":["Ali Akbar Khomeijani Farahani","Hassti Gholam-Shahbazi"],"meta":["May 2019Journal of Language Teaching and Research 10(3):469","DOI:10.17507/jltr.1003.09"],"references":["278696458_Second_Language_Learning_and_Teaching","275541922_Study_of_Emotional_Intelligence_and_Learning_Strategies","271336538_Listening_Comprehension_Performance_Viewed_in_the_Light_of_Emotional_Intelligence_and_Foreign_Language_Listening_Anxiety","269808674_The_Relationship_between_Emotional_Intelligence_and_Language_Learning_Strategy_Use","266886202_Field-DependenceIndependence_Cognitive_Style_and_Performance_on_the_IELTS_Listening_Comprehension","236147822_Exploring_the_relationship_between_metacognitive_awareness_and_listening_performance_with_questionnaire_data","232662669_The_Impact_of_Emotional_Intelligence_on_Iranian_EFL_Learners'_Listening_Proficiency","224953918_A_Gender-based_Approach_to_Pronunciation_Accuracy_of_Advanced","26571143_Emotional_and_Verbal_Intelligences_in_Language_Learning","13460256_Emotional_Intelligence_In_search_of_an_elusive_construct","345651036_Teaching_English_to_Second_Language_Learners_in_Academic_Contexts_Reading_Writing_Listening_and_Speaking","334610598_Listening","325427093_The_effects_of_instructor_language_choice_on_second_language_vocabulary_learning_and_listening_comprehension","323284803_Form-focussed_Instruction_in_CALL_What_Do_Learners_Think","312407249_Effects_of_computer-assisted_glosses_on_EFL_learners'_vocabulary_acquisition_and_reading_comprehension_in_three_learning_conditions","304704180_The_relationship_between_cognitive_and_metacognitive_strategies_age_and_level_of_education","285360956_On_the_Correlation_between_Iranian_EFL_Learners'_Use_of_Metacognitive_Listening_Strategies_and_Their_Emotional_Intelligence","274513337_Techniques_and_Principles_in_Language_Teaching","267777237_Models_of_Emotional_Intelligence","240696003_What_Works_in_School-Based_Social_and_Emotional_Learning_Programs_for_Positive_Youth_Development","49302951_The_Psychology_of_Meaningful_Verbal_Learning","18722021_The_'McMaster_Philosophy'_An_Approach_to_Medical_Education","2641822_Problem_Based_Learning_An_instructional_model_and_its_constructivist_framework"]}
