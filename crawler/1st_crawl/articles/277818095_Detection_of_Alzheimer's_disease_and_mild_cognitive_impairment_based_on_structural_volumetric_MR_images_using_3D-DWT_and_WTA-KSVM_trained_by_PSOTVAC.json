Methods: The method employed 3D data of 178 subjects consisting of 97 NCs, 57 MCIs, and 24 ADs. First, all these 3D MR images were preprocessed with atlas-registered normalization to form an averaged volumetric image. Then, 3D discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) was used to extract wavelet coefficients the volumetric image. The triplets (energy, variance, and Shannon entropy) of all subbands coefficients of 3D-DWT were obtained as feature vector. Afterwards, principle component analysis (PCA) was applied for feature reduction. On the basic of the reduced features, we proposed nine classification methods: three individual classifiers as linear SVM, kernel SVM, and kernel SVM trained by PSO with time-varying acceleration-coefficient (PSOTVAC), with three multiclass methods as Winner-Takes-All (WTA), Max-Wins-Voting, and Directed Acyclic Graph. Results: The 5-fold cross validation results showed that the \"WTA-KSVM + PSOTVAC\" performed best over the OASIS benchmark dataset, with overall accuracy of 81.5% among all proposed nine classifiers. Moreover, the method \"WTA-KSVM + PSOTVAC\" exceeded significantly existing state-of-the-art methods (accuracies of which were less than or equal to 74.0%). Conclusion: We validate the effectiveness of 3D-DWT. The proposed approach has the potential to assist in early diagnosis of ADs and MCIs.","authors":["Yu-Dong Zhang","Shuihua Wang","Preetha Phillips","Zhengchao Dong"],"meta":["August 2015Biomedical Signal Processing and Control 21","DOI:10.1016/j.bspc.2015.05.014"],"references":["284016797_Segmentation_of_MR_Brain_Images_for_Tumor_Extraction_Using_Fuzzy","281582709_Detection_of_Pathological_Brain_in_MRI_Scanning_Based_on_Wavelet-Entropy_and_Naive_Bayes_Classifier","277655584_Preclinical_Diagnosis_of_Magnetic_Resonance_MR_Brain_Images_via_Discrete_Wavelet_Packet_Transform_with_Tsallis_Entropy_and_Generalized_Eigenvalue_Proximal_Support_Vector_Machine_GEPSVM","277132984_Automated_Classification_of_Brain_Images_Using_Wavelet-Energy_and_Biogeography-based_Optimization","276833383_A_Novel_Demodulation_System_Based_on_Continuous_Wavelet_Transform","276075289_Effect_of_Spider_web_plot_in_MR_brain_image_classification","319263181_Forecasting_the_Global_Burden_of_Alzheimer's_Disease","286913759_Cultural_algorithms_Emerging_social_structures_for_the_solution_of_complex_optimization_problems","274088218_Ultrasound-guided_Versus_Fluoroscopy-controlled_Lumbar_Transforaminal_Epidural_Injections_A_Prospective_Randomized_Clinical_Trial","272273809_Computer-Aided_Knee_Osteoarthritis_Classification_System_Using_Artificial_Neural_Netwrok_ANN"]}
