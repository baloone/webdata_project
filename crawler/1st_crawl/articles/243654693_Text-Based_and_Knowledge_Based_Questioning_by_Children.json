{"id":"243654693_Text-Based_and_Knowledge_Based_Questioning_by_Children","abstract":"Three studies investigated the ability of elementary school children to ask and recognize educationally productive questions. Knowledge-based questions formulated in advance of instruction were found to be of a higher order than text-based questions produced after exposure to text materials. Depending on familiarity of the topic, knowledge-based questions varied between basic questions asking for information needed for orientation to a topic and \"wonderment\" questions often aimed at explanation or at resolving discrepancies in knowledge. Children's questions are seen as a potentially valuable resource in education but one that requires a different kind of classroom community from the several kinds commonly found. The potential of a computer-based medium, computer-supported intentional learning environments, for supporting a knowledge-building community is briefly considered.","authors":["Marlene Scardamalia","Carl Bereiter"],"meta":["September 1992Cognition and Instruction 9(3):177-199","DOI:10.1207/s1532690xci0903_1"],"references":["238688360_Computer-supported_intentional_learning_environment","319393833_Strategies_of_Discourse_Comprehension","304346216_The_role_of_question-asking_in_the_elementary_school_classroom","303721551_Communities_of_learning_and_thinking_or_A_context_by_any_other_name","303270804_Cognitive_apprenticeship_Teaching_the_crafts_of_reading_writing_mathematics","284654411_Intentional_learning_as_a_goal_of_instruction_Knowing_learning_and_instruction_Essays_in_honour_of_Robert_Glaser","280984959_Self-questioning_instructional_research_A_review","278976656_Curriculum_materials_teacher_talk_and_student_learning_Case_studies_in_fifth_grade_science_teaching","270413358_Computer-Supported_Intentional_Learning_Environments","247641948_Background_and_Instructional_Effects_on_Achievement_in_Eighth-Grade_English_and_Social_Studies","247323187_Questioning_in_Classrooms_A_Sociolinguistic_Perspective","243766723_The_use_of_knowledge_in_discourse_processing_A_construction-integration_model","242531179_The_role_of_knowledge_in_discourse_comprehension_A_constructionntegration_model","241646708_Opportunities_for_Research_on_the_Organizational_Impact_of_School_Computers","240801669_The_English_Infant_School_and_Informal_Education","240512920_Electronic_Interactions_How_Students_and_Teachers_Organize_Schooling_Over_the_Wires","238626734_Teaching_Students_to_Generate_Questions_A_Review_of_the_Intervention_Studies","234587422_The_Elementary_School_Training_Program_in_Scientific_Inquiry_Urbana","223025495_To_ask_a_question_one_must_know_what_is_not_known","222452521_Constructive_Interaction_and_the_Iterative_Process_of_Understanding_in_Japanese","220547061_Interestingness_Controlling_Inferences","49551181_Strategies_of_discourse_comprehension","44552297_Concepts_Kinds_and_Cognitive_Development"]}
