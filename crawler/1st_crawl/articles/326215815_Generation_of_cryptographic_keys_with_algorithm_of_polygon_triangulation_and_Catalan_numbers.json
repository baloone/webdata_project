{"id":"326215815_Generation_of_cryptographic_keys_with_algorithm_of_polygon_triangulation_and_Catalan_numbers","abstract":"In this paper, a procedure for the application of one computational geometry algorithm in the process of generating hidden cryptographic keys from one segment of a 3D image is presented. The presented procedure consists of three phases. In the first phase, the separation of one segment from the 3D image and determination of the triangulation of the separated polygon are done. In the second phase, a conversion from the obtained triangulation of the polygon in the record that represents the Catalan key is done. In the third phase, the Catalan-key is applied in the encryption of the text based on the balanced parentheses combinatorial problem.","authors":["Muzafer H.
