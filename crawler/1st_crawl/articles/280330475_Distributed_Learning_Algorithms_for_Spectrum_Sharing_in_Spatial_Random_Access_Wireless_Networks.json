{"id":"280330475_Distributed_Learning_Algorithms_for_Spectrum_Sharing_in_Spatial_Random_Access_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"We consider distributed optimization over orthogonal collision channels in\nspatial random access networks. Users are spatially distributed and each user\nis in the interference range of a few other users. Each user is allowed to\ntransmit over a subset of the shared channels with a certain attempt\nprobability. We study both the non-cooperative and cooperative settings. In the\nformer, the goal of each user is to maximize its own rate irrespective of the\nutilities of other users. In the latter, the goal is to achieve proportionally\nfair rates among users. Simple distributed learning algorithms are developed to\nsolve these problems. The efficiencies of the proposed algorithms are\ndemonstrated via both theoretical analysis and simulation results.","authors":["Kobi Cohen","Angelia Nedic","R.
