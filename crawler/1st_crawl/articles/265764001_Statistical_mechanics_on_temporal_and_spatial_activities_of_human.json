{"id":"265764001_Statistical_mechanics_on_temporal_and_spatial_activities_of_human","abstract":"Quantitative analysis on human behavior, especially mining and modeling temporal and spatial regularities, is a common focus of statistical physics and complexity sciences. The in-depth understanding of human behavior helps in explaining many complex socio-economic phenomena, and in finding applications in public opinion monitoring, disease control, transportation system design, calling center services, information recommendation, and so on. This review article summarizes the state-of-the-art progresses of human dynamics, including the empirical analysis and modeling on human temporal activities, the empirical analysis and modeling on human mobility patterns, and the applications of human dynamics. Furthermore, this article reviews the advanced and insufficient points of related works, and points out some unsolved challenges in both theoretical and practical aspects.","authors":["Tao Zhou","Xiao-Pu Han","Xiao-Yong Yan","Zimo Yang"],"meta":["July 2013Dianzi Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China 4(4)","DOI:10.3969/j.issn.1001-0548-2013.04.001"],"references":["324932789_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_its_Applications","321708653_MAXIMUM_LIKELIHOOD_ESTIMATION_OF_THE_PARAMETERS_OF_THE_GAMMA_DISTRIBUTION_AND_THEIR_BIAS","313203504_Reality_mining_Sensing_complex_social_systems","289662371_Empirical_statistics_on_individual_human_travel_behavior","289231462_A_model_of_human_behavior_dynamics_and_exact_results","288446802_Human_dynamics_analysis_in_online_collaborative_writing","287731424_Exploring_the_mobility_patterns_of_public_transport_passengers","286270780_Judgment_Under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biases","285679877_Precision_of_geocoded_locations_and_network_distance_estimates","284672227_Analysis_of_human_behavior_scaling_law_based_on_library_loans"]}
