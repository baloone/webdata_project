{"id":"346111004_Effective_measures_to_foster_girls'_interest_in_secondary_computer_science_education","abstract":"The interest of girls in computing drops early during primary and secondary education, with minimal recovery in later education stages. In combination with the growing shortage of qualified computer science personnel, this is becoming a major issue, and also a target of numerous studies that examine measures, interventions, and strategies to boost girlsâ€™ commitment to computing. Yet, the results of existing studies are difficult to navigate, and hence are being very rarely employed in classrooms. In this paper, we summarize the existing body of knowledge on the effective interventions to recruit and retain girls in computer science education, intending to equip educators with a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate map of interventions recommended in the existing literature. To this end, we perform an aggregated umbrella literature review of 11 existing reviews on the topic, together accumulating joined knowledge from over 800 publications, and formulate the findings in a map of 22 concrete interventions structured in six groups according to their phase and purpose.","authors":["Lucia Happe","Barbora Buhnova","Anne Koziolek","Ingo Wagner"],"meta":["May 2021Education and Information Technologies 26(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-020-10379-x"],"references":["344273671_Girl-Friendly_Computer_Science_Classroom_Czechitas_Experience_Report","335690290_Going_beyond_digital_literacy_to_develop_computational_thinking_in_K-12_education","335649968_Assisting_women_in_career_change_towards_software_engineering_experience_from_Czechitas_NGO","335493633_Women_Want_to_Learn_Tech_Lessons_from_the_Czechitas_Education_Project","327703221_Directions_for_research_on_gender_imbalance_in_the_IT_profession","325180751_How_Do_We_Encourage_Gifted_Girls_to_Pursue_and_Succeed_in_Science_and_Engineering","340719485_Going_beyond_digital_literacy_to_develop_computational_thinking_in_K-12_education","335698968_Examining_Unequal_Gender_Distribution_in_Software_Engineering","334901160_I_just_do_what_the_boys_tell_me_Exploring_small_group_student_interactions_in_an_integrated_STEM_unit","326848775_The_Gender_Question_in_Education_Theory_Pedagogy_and_Politics"]}
