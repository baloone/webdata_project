{"id":"229118092_Measuring_complexity_in_three-trophic_level_systems","abstract":"This essay is a trial on measuring complexity in a three-trophic level system by using a convex function of the informational entropy. The complexity measure defined here is compatible with the fact that real complexity lies between ordered and disordered states. Applying this measure to the data collected for two three-trophic level systems some hints about their organization are obtained.","authors":["J.R.C.
