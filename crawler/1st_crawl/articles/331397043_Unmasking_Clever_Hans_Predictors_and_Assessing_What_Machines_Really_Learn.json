{"id":"331397043_Unmasking_Clever_Hans_Predictors_and_Assessing_What_Machines_Really_Learn","abstract":"Current learning machines have successfully solved hard application problems, reaching high accuracy and displaying seemingly \"intelligent\" behavior. Here we apply recent techniques for explaining decisions of state-of-the-art learning machines and analyze various tasks from computer vision and arcade games. This showcases a spectrum of problem-solving behaviors ranging from naive and short-sighted, to well-informed and strategic. We observe that standard performance evaluation metrics can be oblivious to distinguishing these diverse problem solving behaviors. Furthermore, we propose our semi-automated Spectral Relevance Analysis that provides a practically effective way of characterizing and validating the behavior of nonlinear learning machines. This helps to assess whether a learned model indeed delivers reliably for the problem that it was conceived for. Furthermore, our work intends to add a voice of caution to the ongoing excitement about machine intelligence and pledges to evaluate and judge some of these recent successes in a more nuanced manner.","authors":["Sebastian Lapuschkin","Stephan Wäldchen","Alexander Binder","Grégoire Montavon"],"meta":["March 2019Nature Communications 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-019-08987-4"],"references":["331235492_Explaining_the_unique_nature_of_individual_gait_patterns_with_deep_learning","326381669_Large-Scale_High-Resolution_Comparison_of_the_Core_Visual_Object_Recognition_Behavior_of_Humans_Monkeys_and_State-of-the-Art_Deep_Artificial_Neural_Networks","323410549_Towards_Exact_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations_with_Machine-Learned_Force_Fields","335707959_Understanding_Patch-Based_Learning_of_Video_Data_by_Explaining_Predictions","329473176_A_general_reinforcement_learning_algorithm_that_masters_chess_shogi_and_Go_through_self-play","327186241_Fair_play_The_ethics_of_sport_fourth_edition","326643426_Explaining_Therapy_Predictions_with_Layer-Wise_Relevance_Propagation_in_Neural_Networks","322057595_Interpretable_Explanations_of_Black_Boxes_by_Meaningful_Perturbation","321819012_Socially_aware_motion_planning_with_deep_reinforcement_learning","321666784_Human_learning_in_Atari","321325049_AI_Safety_Gridworlds","320473480_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_without_human_knowledge","320867322_Accountability_of_AI_Under_the_Law_The_Role_of_Explanation","320796867_Visualizing_and_Understanding_Atari_Agents","319770411_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning"]}
