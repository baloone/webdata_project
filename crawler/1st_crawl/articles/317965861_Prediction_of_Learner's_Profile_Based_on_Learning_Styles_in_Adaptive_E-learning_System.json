{"id":"317965861_Prediction_of_Learner's_Profile_Based_on_Learning_Styles_in_Adaptive_E-learning_System","abstract":"The major requirement of present e-learning system is to provide a personalized interface with adaptiveness. This is possible to provide by analyzing the learning behaviors of the learners in the e-learning portal through Web Usage Mining (WUM). In this paper, a method is proposed where the learning behavior of the learner is captured using web logs and the learning styles are categorized according to Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM). Each category of FSLSM learner is provided with the respective content and interface that is required for the learner to learn. Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm is used to cluster the captured data into FSLSM categories. Gravitational Search based Back Propagation Neural Network (GSBPNN) algorithm is used to predict the learning styles of the new learner. This algorithm is a modification of basic Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithm that calculates the weights using Gravitation Search Algorithm (GSA). The algorithm is validated on the captured data and compared using various metrics with the basic BPNN algorithm. The result shows that the performance of GSBPNN algorithm is better than BPNN. Based on the identified learning style, the adaptive contents and interface can be provided to the learner.","authors":["Sucheta Kolekar","Radhika M Pai","Manohara Pai M M"],"meta":["June 2017International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 12(06):31","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v12i06.6579","Project: Adaptive E-learning System: Identification of Learning Styles based on Web Log Data to provide Adaptive User Interface in Adaptive E-learning"],"references":["329162405_Fuzzy_C-Means_Clustering_Model_for_Identification_of_Students'_Learning_Preferences_in_Online_Environment","321183997_Learning_Style_Classification_Based_on_Student's_Behavior_in_Moodle_Learning_Management_System","302306622_Analysis_of_Learning_Styles_for_Adaptive_E-Learning","286004063_A_review_of_gravitational_search_algorithm","282613601_The_Impact_of_Learning_Styles_on_Learner's_Performance_in_E-Learning_Environment","274175079_State_of_The_Art_of_Learning_Styles-Based_Adaptive_Educational_Hypermedia_Systems_Ls-Baehss","272040719_Automatic_detection_of_learning_styles_state_of_the_art","202144697_Intelligent_Techniques_in_Personalization_of_Learning_in_e-Learning_Systems","300790129_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks_to_Identify_Learning_Styles","294688404_Approximating_number_of_hidden_layer_neurons_in_multiple_hidden_layer_BPNN_architecture","278653881_A_Hybrid_Gravitational_Search_Algorithm_and_Back-Propagation_for_Training_Feedforward_Neural_Networks","276859713_Fuzzy-logic_based_learning_style_prediction_in_e-learning_using_web_interface_information","273040837_Integrating_learning_styles_and_adaptive_e-learning_system_Current_developments_problems_and_opportunities","271573204_An_Improved_Gravitational_Search_Algorithm_for_Dynamic_Neural_Network_Identification","262309893_Profiling_Student_Learning_Styles_with_Multilayer_Perceptron_Neural_Networks","261447969_Effect_of_mining_educational_data_to_improve_adaptation_of_learning_in_e-learning_system","223191504_Automatic_detection_of_learning_styles_for_an_e-learning_system","222670626_A_learning_style_classification_mechanism_for_e-learning","221217660_Using_Clustering_Technique_for_Students'_Grouping_in_Intelligent_E-Learning_Systems","45904886_Evaluation_of_E-Learners_Behaviour_using_Different_Fuzzy_Clustering_Models_A_Comparative_Study"]}
