{"id":"289960319_Design_of_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Set-based_Fuzzy_Neural_Networks_and_Its_Optimization_Using_Generation-based_Evolution","abstract":"This paper concerns the design methodology of interval type-2 fuzzy set-based fuzzy neural networks (IT2FSFNN). IT2FSFNN is the network of combination between the fuzzy neural network (FNN) and interval type-2 fuzzy set with uncertainty. The premise part of the network is composed of the fuzzy division of respective input space and the consequence part of the network is represented by polynomial functions with interval set. To determine the structure and estimate the values of the parameters of IT2FSFNN we consider the successive tuning method with generation-based evolution by means of genetic algorithms. The proposed network is evaluated with the use of numerical experimentations.","authors":["K.-J. Park","S.-K. Oh","Y.-K.
