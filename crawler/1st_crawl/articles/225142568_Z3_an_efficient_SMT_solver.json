{"id":"225142568_Z3_an_efficient_SMT_solver","abstract":"Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem is a decision problem for logical first order formulas with respect to combinations of background theories such as: arithmetic, bit-vectors, arrays,\nand uninterpreted functions. Z3 is a new and efficient SMT Solver freely available from Microsoft Research. It is used in\nvarious software verification and analysis applications.","authors":["Leonardo de Moura","Nikolaj Bj√∏rner"],"meta":["April 2008Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4963:337-340","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24","SourceDBLP","Conference: International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems"],"references":["222302488_Model-based_Theory_Combination","221560149_SYNERGY_a_new_algorithm_for_property_checking","220997415_Back_to_the_future_Revisiting_precise_program_verification_using_SMT_solvers","248594981_Efficient_Incremental_E_-_matching_for_SMT_Solvers","244419981_BoogiePL_A_typed_procedural_language_for_checking_object-oriented_programs","242787230_The_SLAM_project_Debugging_system_software_via_static_analysis","238626536_SMT-LIB_The_Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories_Library","228585074_Relevancy_propagation","221402940_A_fast_linear-arithmetic_solver_for_DPLL_T","220997861_The_SLAM_project_Debugging_system_software_via_static_analysis"]}
