{"id":"267425681_Face_Analysis_Using_Local_Binary_Patterns","abstract":"Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture opera-tor which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel with the value of the center pixel and considers the result as a binary number. Due to its discriminative power and computational simplicity, LBP texture operator has become a popular approach in var-ious applications. This chapter presents the LBP methodology and its application to face image analysis problems, demonstrating that LBP features are also efficient in nontraditional texture analysis tasks. We explain how to easily derive efficient LBP based face descriptions which combine into a single feature vector the global shape, the texture and eventually the dynamics of facial features. The obtained representations are then applied to face and eye detection, face recognition and facial expression analysis problems, yielding in excellent performance.","authors":["A Hadid","Guoying Zhao","T Ahonen","Matti Pietikainen"],"meta":["October 2008","DOI:10.1142/9781848161160_0012"],"references":["251202290_Texture_analysis_with_local_binary_patterns","245642564_Chapter_11_Facial_Expression_Analysis","225940935_Facial_Expression_Analysis","221506782_Learning_to_Fuse_3D2D_Based_Face_Recognition_at_Both_Feature_and_Decision_Levels","221304831_Face_Recognition_with_Local_Binary_Patterns","221260064_Conditional_Mutual_Infomation_Based_Boosting_for_Facial_Expression_Recognition","220931536_Ensemble_of_Piecewise_FDA_Based_on_Spatial_Histograms_of_Local_Gabor_Binary_Patterns_for_Face_Recognition","220930698_Robust_head_pose_estimation_using_LGBP","220869337_Gender_Classification_Based_on_Boosting_Local_Binary_Pattern","220566092_Face_Recognition_A_Literature_Survey","220182105_Face_recognition_by_elastic_bunch_graph_matching","41386874_Robust-to-Illumination_Face_Localisation_using_Active_Shape_Models_and_Local_Binary_Patterns","37433523_Face_Authentication_Using_Adapted_Local_Binary_Pattern_Histograms","6506620_Illumination_Invariant_Face_Recognition_Using_Near-Infrared_Images","4374541_Real_Time_Face_Detection_and_Facial_Expression_Recognition_Development_and_Applications_to_Human_Computer_Interaction","4232845_Local_Binary_Patterns_as_an_Image_Preprocessing_for_Face_Authentication","4193905_Local_Gabor_Binary_Pattern_Histogram_Sequence_LGBPHS_A_novel_non-statistical_model_for_face_representation_and_recognition","4186342_Robust_facial_expression_recognition_using_local_binary_patterns","4156441_Jensen-Shannon_Boosting_learning_for_object_recognition","4119592_Dynamics_of_Facial_Expression_Extracted_Automatically_from_Video","4090165_S_On_performance_evaluation_of_face_detection_and_localization_algorithms","4082331_From_facial_expression_to_level_of_interest_a_spatio-temporal_approach","3940582_Rapid_Object_Detection_using_a_Boosted_Cascade_of_Simple_Features","3455236_Automatic_Facial_Expression_Recognition_Using_Facial_Animation_Parameters_and_Multistream_HMMs","3308307_Color_and_Texture_Descriptors","3193769_Floatboost_learning_and_statistical_face_detection_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell","3193162_The_FERET_Evaluation_Methodology_for_Face-Recognition_Algorithms","320112472_Face_recognition_by_Elastic_Bunch_Graph_Matching","313608078_Face_recognition_by_elastic_bunch_graph_matching","288913418_Floatboost_learning_and_statistical_face_detection","256075302_Eigenfaces_for_Recognition","248593001_Color_and_Texture_Descriptors_Circuits_and_Systems_for_Video_Technology","240224936_Rapid_object_detection_using_a_boosted_cascade_of_simple_features","239546749_Statistical_Learning_Theory","228337242_Facial_expression_recognition_with_local_binary_patterns_and_linear_programming","224621331_Learning_Local_Descriptors_for_Face_Detection","222738212_A_Comparative_Study_of_Texture_Measures_with_Classification_Based_on_Feature_Distributions","221383647_Graph_Matching_Iris_Image_Blocks_with_Local_Binary_Pattern","221364416_A_Discriminative_Feature_Space_for_Detecting_and_Recognizing_Faces","220849851_Boosting_Local_Binary_Pattern_LBP-Based_Face_Recognition","22620191_Emotion_recognition_The_role_of_facial_movement_and_the_relative_importance_of_upper_and_lower_areas_of_the_face","6690158_Face_Description_with_Local_Binary_Patterns_Application_to_Face_Recognition","6397809_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Local_Binary_Patterns_with_an_Application_to_Facial_Expressions","4133758_Face_detection_using_improved_LBP_under_Bayesian_framework","4133710_Shape_localization_based_on_statistical_method_using_extended_local_binary_pattern","4119583_Evaluation_of_Face_Resolution_for_Expression_Analysis","4090595_Face_recognition_based_on_the_appearance_of_local_regions","3703219_The_FERET_Evaluation_Methodology_for_Face_Recognition_Algorithm","3659896_A_Bayesian_similarity_measure_for_direct_image_matching","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns","2605734_Comprehensive_Database_for_Facial_Expression_Analysis","2941192_The_CMU_motion_of_body_MoBo_database","2458317_Face_Detection_in_Still_Gray_Images","2415690_Texture_Classification_Are_Filter_Banks_Necessary"]}
