{"id":"322168736_Improving_Performance_and_Progression_of_Novice_Programmers_Factors_Considerations","abstract":"Abstractâ€”Teaching computer programming is recognized to\nbe difficult and a real challenge. The biggest problem faced by\nnovice programmers is their lack of understanding of basic\nprogramming concepts. A visualized learning tool was\ndeveloped and used by volunteered first-year students for two\nsemesters. The purposes of this paper are: Firstly, to emphasize\nfactors which directly affect the performance of our students\nnegatively. Secondly, to examine whether the proposed tool\nwould improve their performance and learning progression or\nnot. This tool provides many features and enhancement which\nwere presented to students as pre-lecture material. The results\nof adopting this tool were conducted using a pre-survey and\npost-survey questionnaire. As a result, students who used the\nlearning tool showed better performance in their programming","authors":["Hala Shaari","Nuredin Ahmed"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Information and Education Technology 8(1):7-10","DOI:10.18178/ijiet.2018.8.1.1003","Project: Research interest"],"references":["268523565_Predictors_of_Novice's_Programmers_Performance","234796737_Learning_to_Program_Learning_to_Construct_Mechanisms_and_Explanations","227203430_Issues_and_Difficulties_in_Teaching_Novice_Computer_Programming","252662721_An_Empirical_Investigation_of_the_Relationship_Between_Success_in_Mathematics_and_Visual_Programming_Courses","250145036_A_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Investigation_of_Using_Alice_Programming_to_Improve_Confidence_Enjoyment_and_Achievement_Among_Non-Majors","238248856_Interest_in_CS_as_a_major_drops_among_incoming_freshmen","234762863_The_challenges_of_teaching_computer_programming","233315542_Investigating_and_improving_the_models_of_programming_concepts_held_by_novice_programmers","232961599_My_program_is_ok_-_am_I_Computing_freshmen's_experiences_of_doing_programming_assignments","228556254_Using_Alice_in_a_computer_science_survey_course"]}
