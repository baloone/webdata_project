{"id":"338500838_Virtual_Desktop_Infrastructures_in_a_Graduate_Computer_Science_Curriculum","abstract":"This paper presents the use of and experience with virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) in the Masters in Computer Science program at Rivier University. In addition to reducing hardware costs and system administration loads, VDIs also provide convenient means for both students and faculty to access software tools and applications from both home and the university. The combination of VDIs and open source software gives us a good way to provide the students with the necessary tools, both in and out of class, and to perform the work that instructors expect. VDIs provide a convenient way to create the specialized Computer Science desktops (CSDs) only for the computer science students.","authors":["David Pitts","Vladimir Riabov"],"meta":["December 2019","Project: Educational Research"],"references":["262319088_Why_virtual_desktop_at_CCRI_finding_sustainability_for_desktop_support"]}
