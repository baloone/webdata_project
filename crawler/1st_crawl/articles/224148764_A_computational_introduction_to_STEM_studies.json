{"id":"224148764_A_computational_introduction_to_STEM_studies","abstract":"We report on the content and early evaluation of a new introductory programming course “Media Propelled Computational Thinking,” (abbreviated MPCT and pronounced iMPaCT). MPCT is integrated into a freshman-level program designed for under-prepared students with interests in a STEM discipline. It is intended to reduce attrition rates by fostering student intuition in, appreciation of, and confidence about basic pre-calculus concepts. The MPCT curriculum is problem-driven, with analytical challenge exercises that are intended to motivate inquiry and to illustrate the reasoning used in the STEM professions Preliminary evaluation results are encouraging - students from a wide range of academic majors found MPCT engaging, and report that the course conveyed insight, and decreased anxiety about foundational mathematical concepts.","authors":["Eric Andrew Freudenthal","Alexandria N.
