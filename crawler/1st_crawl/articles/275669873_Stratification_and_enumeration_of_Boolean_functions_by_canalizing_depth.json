{"id":"275669873_Stratification_and_enumeration_of_Boolean_functions_by_canalizing_depth","abstract":"Boolean network models have gained popularity in computational systems\nbiology over the last dozen years. Many of these networks use canalizing\nBoolean functions, which has led to increased interest in the study of these\nfunctions. The canalizing depth of a function describes how many canalizing\nvariables can be recursively picked off, until a non-canalizing function\nremains. In this paper, we show how every Boolean function has a unique\nalgebraic form involving extended monomial layers and a well-defined core\npolynomial. This generalizes recent work on the algebraic structure of nested\ncanalizing functions, and it yields a stratification of all Boolean functions\nby their canalizing depth. As a result, we obtain closed formulas for the\nnumber of n-variable Boolean functions with depth k, which simultaneously\ngeneralizes enumeration formulas for canalizing, and nested canalizing\nfunctions.","authors":["Qijun He","Matthew Macauley"],"meta":["April 2015Physica D Nonlinear Phenomena 314(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.physd.2015.09.016","SourcearXiv"],"references":["284024691_Europhys_Lett","262225595_On_Analysis_and_Generation_of_some_Biologically_Important_Boolean_Functions","220329956_Asymptotic_Aproximations_for_the_Number_of_Fanout-Free_Functions","47843440_Inferring_Biologically_Relevant_Models_Nested_Canalyzing_Functions","45930229_The_phase_diagram_of_random_Boolean_networks_with_nested_canalizing_functions","8975318_Random_Boolean_Network_Models_and_the_Yeast_Transcriptional_Network","8662490_The_Yeast_Cell-Cycle_Network_Is_Robustly_Designed","8387911_Activities_and_Sensitivities_in_Boolean_Network_Models","8156020_Genetic_Networks_with_Canalyzing_Boolean_Rules_are_Always_Stable","3046997_Asymptotic_Approximations_for_the_Number_of_Fanout-Free_Functions","297994376_Mathematical_Concepts_and_Methods_in_Modern_Biology","268452061_Nested_Canalizing_Functions_and_Their_Networks","268067954_Mathematical_concepts_and_methods_in_modern_biology_Using_modern_discrete_models","263053671_On_Analysis_and_Generation_of_some_Biologically_Important_Boolean_Functions","257866934_Phase_transition_of_Boolean_networks_with_partially_nested_canalizing_functions","250793786_Order_or_chaos_in_Boolean_gene_networks_depends_on_the_mean_fraction_of_canalizing_functions","248603444_Metabolic_stability_and_epigenesis_in_randomly_constructed_genetic_J","234012931_Canalizing_Boolean_Functions_Maximize_Mutual_Information","230912027_Random_Networks_of_Automata_A_Simple_Annealed_Approximation","230570467_Canalizing_Boolean_Functions_Maximize_the_Mutual_Information","227587321_Evolution_of_Canalizing_Boolean_Networks","224825333_Boolean_nested_canalizing_functions_A_comprehensive_analysis","222674179_The_number_and_probability_of_canalizing_functions","221644792_Discrete_Models_of_Biochemical_Networks_The_Toric_Variety_of_Nested_Canalyzing_Functions","51932014_The_Number_of_Multistate_Nested_Canalyzing_Functions","51851898_Nested_Canalyzing_Depth_and_Network_Stability","18569963_The_Large_Scale_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Gene_Control_Circuits_An_Ensemble_Approach","17383444_Metabolic_Stability_and_Epigenisis_in_Randomly_Connected_Genetic_Nets","10729727_The_topology_of_the_regulatory_interactions_predics_the_expression_pattern_of_the_segment_polarity_genes_in_Drosophila_melanogaster","8462044_A_Computational_Algebra_Approach_to_the_Reverse_Engineering_of_Gene_Regulatory_Networks","7670709_Canalizing_Kauffman_Networks_Nonergodicity_and_Its_Effect_on_Their_Critical_Behavior","5416147_Nested_Canalyzing_Unate_Cascade_and_Polynomial_Functions","3047226_On_the_Number_of_Fanout-Free_Functions_and_Unate_Cascade_Functions","2524223_The_topology_and_signature_of_the_regulatory_interactions_predict_the_expression_pattern_of_the_segment_polarity_genes_in_Drosophila_rnelanogaster"]}
