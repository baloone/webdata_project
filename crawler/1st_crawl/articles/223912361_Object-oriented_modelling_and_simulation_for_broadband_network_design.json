{"id":"223912361_Object-oriented_modelling_and_simulation_for_broadband_network_design","abstract":"Various broadband networks have been planned and installed in recent years due to the increasing demand for new media applications and services. Since a nation-wide broadband network or national backbone as information superhighway requires an astronomical amount of investment, optimum design of the broadband network is very important. The design of the broadband network is very complicated and one has to consider network topology, resource capacities, routing schemes, and call admission control schemes as well as various traffic types.In this paper, an object-oriented (OO) approach is proposed for modelling and simulation of broadband networks for the purpose of analysis and design. An OO model which represents object and behaviour is presented with the broadband bursty traffics being modeled at the burst and call levels. The proposed OO modelling approach is applied to a backbone network design problem in Korea for demonstrating its validity and usefulness.","authors":["Youngok Rhee","Sung Joo Park"],"meta":["July 1997Simulation Practice and Theory 5(5):405-424","DOI:10.1016/S0928-4869(96)00022-5","SourceDBLP"],"references":["3235408_A_Markov_Modulated_Characterization_of_Packetized_Voice_and_Data_Traffic_and_Related_Statistical_Multiplexer_Performance","3232792_Virtual_Path_and_Link_Capacity_Design_for_ATM_Networks","3195256_Modeling_for_telecommunications_networks","318258402_A_Block-Oriented_Network_Simulator_BONeS","261283204_Block-oriented_network_simulator_BONeS","224732506_Protocol_Representation_with_Finite-State_Models","223749203_Performance_comparison_of_media_access_protocols_for_Gbits_networks_in_the_local_area","220070763_Process-Translatable_Petri_Nets_for_the_Rapid_Prototyping_of_Process_Control_Systems","3772524_The_Research_Queueing_Package_Modeling_Environment_resqme","3523202_A_call_admission_control_for_ATM_networks_based_on_individual_multiplexed_traffic_characteristics","3235062_Queueing_Network_Simulations_of_Computer_Communication","3232958_Equivalent_Capacity_and_Its_Application_to_Bandwidth_Allocation_in_High-Speed_Networks","3232896_Simulative_Analysis_of_Optimal_Resource_Allocation_and_Routing_in_Ibcn'S","3232842_TOPNET_A_Tool_for_the_Visual_Simulation_of_Communication_Networks","3232638_Topology_design_and_band_with_allocation_in_ATM_nets","3232519_Resource_allocation_for_broadband_networks","2954235_Modeling_and_Distributed_Simulation_of_a_Broadband-ISDN_Network","2656615_Simulation_Comparison_of_Broadband_Networking_Technologies"]}
