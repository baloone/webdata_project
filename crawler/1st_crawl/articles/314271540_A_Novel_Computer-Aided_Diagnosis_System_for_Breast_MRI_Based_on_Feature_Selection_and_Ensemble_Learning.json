{"id":"314271540_A_Novel_Computer-Aided_Diagnosis_System_for_Breast_MRI_Based_on_Feature_Selection_and_Ensemble_Learning","abstract":"Breast cancer is a common cancer among women. With the development of modern medical science and information technology, medical imaging techniques have an increasingly important role in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. In this paper, we propose an automated computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) framework for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The scheme consists of an ensemble of several machine learning-based techniques, including ensemble under-sampling (EUS) for imbalanced data processing, the Relief algorithm for feature selection, the subspace method for providing data diversity, and Adaboost for improving the performance of base classifiers. We extracted morphological, various texture, and Gabor features. To clarify the feature subsets' physical meaning, subspaces are built by combining morphological features with each kind of texture or Gabor feature. We tested our proposal using a manually segmented Region of Interest (ROI) data set, which contains 438 images of malignant tumors and 1898 images of normal tissues or benign tumors. Our proposal achieves an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.9617, which outperforms most other state-of-the-art breast MRI CADx systems. Compared with other methods, our proposal significantly reduces the false-positive classification rate.","authors":["Wei Lu","Roger Zhe Li","Jinghui Chu"],"meta":["March 2017Computers in Biology and Medicine 83","DOI:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.03.002"],"references":["302341151_Textural_Features_for_Image_Classification","284043217_ROC_Graphs_Notes_and_Practical_Considerations_for_Researchers","272377201_Computer-aided_detection_CAD_system_for_breast_MRI_in_assessment_of_local_tumor_extent_nodal_status_and_multifocality_of_invasive_breast_cancers_Preliminary_study","225540813_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","224608502_RUSBoost_A_Hybrid_Approach_to_Alleviating_Class_Imbalance","223713209_Wrappers_for_Feature_Subset_Selection","221900796_A_Review_on_Ensembles_for_the_Class_Imbalance_Problem_Bagging-_Boosting-_and_Hybrid-Based_Approaches","220499843_Neural_Networks_and_the_BiasVariance_Dilemma","29467751_Top_10_algorithms_in_data_mining","23955426_Anniversary_Paper_History_and_status_of_CAD_and_quantitative_image_analysis_The_role_of_Medical_Physics_and_AAPM","23950667_Computer-Aided_Detection_and_Diagnosis_of_Breast_Cancer_With_Mammography_Recent_Advances","14004319_Morphological_Feature_Extraction_for_the_Classification_of_Digital_Images_of_Cancerous_Tissues","8428333_Efficacy_of_MRI_and_Mammography_for_Breast-Cancer_Screening_in_Women_with_a_Familial_or_Genetic_Predisposition","7995893_Global_trends_in_breast_cancer_incidence_and_mortality_1973-1997","3140150_Mammogram_Segmentation_by_Contour_Searching_and_Mass_Lesions_Classification_With_Neural_Network","3115759_Haralick_RM_Shanmuga_K_Dinstein_ITextural_features_for_image_classification_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_3_610-621","299955306_Spatiotemporal_evolution_of_a_single-electrode_nanosecond_pulsed_microplasma_jet_over_water","287799844_Computer-Aided_Diagnosis_Scheme_for_Distinguishing_Between_Benign_and_Malignant_Masses_in_Breast_DCE-MRI","284309479_Gray_level-gradient_co-occurrence_matrix_texture_analysis_method","282205074_Image_features_extraction_for_masses_classification_in_mammograms","280559352_Analysis_of_tissue_abnormality_and_breast_density_in_mammographic_images_using_a_uniform_local_directional_pattern","279223459_A_novel_computer_aided_breast_mass_detection_scheme_based_on_morphological_enhancement_and_SLIC_superpixel_segmentation","264984061_Mass_Classification_in_Mammograms_Using_Selected_Geometry_and_Texture_Features_and_a_New_SVM-Based_Feature_Selection_Method","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","224541268_Learning_from_Imbalanced_Data","224377519_A_Theoretical_Comparison_of_Texture_Algorithms","221996712_Introduction_of_decision_trees","221749384_Detection_and_classification_of_contrast-enhancing_masses_by_a_fully_automatic_computer-assisted_diagnosis_system_for_breast_MRI","49757986_Role_of_MRI_magnetic_resonance_imaging_versus_conventional_imaging_for_breast_cancer_presurgical_staging_in_young_women_or_with_dense_breast","44585063_Neoadjuvant_chemotherapy_for_breast_cancer_Correlation_between_the_baseline_MR_imaging_findings_and_responses_to_therapy","23465371_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Lesion_Morphology_and_Texture_Features_for_Diagnostic_Prediction_in_Breast_MRI","3221146_Gradient_and_texture_analysis_for_the_classification_of_mammographic_masses"]}
