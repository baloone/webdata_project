{"id":"289656324_Ontology-based_collaborative_recommendation","abstract":"Recommender systems have emerged as critical tools that help alleviate the burden of information overload for users. Since these systems have to deal with a variety of modes of user interactions, collaborative recommendation must be sensitive to a user's specific context and changing interests over time. Our approach to building context-sensitive collaborative recommendation is a hybrid one that incorporates semantic knowledge in the form of a domain ontology. User profiles are defined rel- Ative to the ontology, giving rise to an ontological user profile. In this pa- per, we describe how ontological user profiles are learned, incrementally updated, and used for collaborative recommendation. We empirically show that the ontological approach significantly improves the accuracy and coverage of recommendations.","authors":["Ahu Sieg","Bamshad Mobasher","Robin Burke"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["313738343_Capturing_interest_through_inference_and_visualization_Ontological_user_profiling_in_recommender_systems","220243209_Improving_Accuracy_of_Recommender_System_by_Item_Clustering"]}
