They also reported under-assessed CT practices like debugging, iterating, and collaborating. Students of experienced e-textile teachers performed substantially better than those with novice e-textile teachers.\nImplications: Portfolios provide a viable addition to traditional performance or survey assessments and meet a need to promote communication skills.","authors":["Deborah A.
