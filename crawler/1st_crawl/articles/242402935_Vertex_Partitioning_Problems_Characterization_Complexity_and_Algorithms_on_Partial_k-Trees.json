{"id":"242402935_Vertex_Partitioning_Problems_Characterization_Complexity_and_Algorithms_on_Partial_k-Trees","abstract":"This thesis investigates the computational complexity of algorithmic problems defined on graphs. At the abstract level of the complexity spectrum we discriminate polynomial-time solvable problems from N P-complete problems, while at the concrete level we improve on polynomial-time algorithms for generally hard problems restricted to tree-decomposable graphs. One contribution of this thesis is a precise characterization of vertex partitioning problems which include variants of domination, coloring and packing. An elaboration of this characterization is given for problems defined over vertex subsets and over maximal/minimal vertex subsets. We introduce several new graph parameters as vertex partition generalizations of classical parameters. The given characterizations provide a basis for a taxonomy of vertex partitioning problems, facilitating their common algorithmic treatment and allowing for their uniform complexity classification. We explore the computational complexity of two important types of problems","authors":["Jan Arne Telle"],"meta":["July 2008"],"references":["268839824_Recent_results_and_open_problems_in_domination_theory","265626045_On_n-irredundance_and_n-domination","256543191_Perfect_k-domination_in_graphs","238656828_On_the_complexity_and_combinatorics_of_covering_finite_complexes","228580178_Beyond_NP-completeness_for_problems_of_bounded_width_Hardness_for_the_W_hierarchy","225921088_Algorithmic_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","341385205_Linear_time_algorithms_for_NP-hard_problems_restricted_to_partial_k-trees","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","268840059_Computing_the_maximum_order_of_an_open_irredundant_set_in_a_tree","268609467_On_n-domination_n-dependence_and_forbidden_subgraphs","268497582_A_Linear_algorithm_for_the_Grundy_coloring_number_of_a_tree","266256764_Perfect_domination_in_graphs","266211372_Efficient_dominating_sets_in_graphs","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","264932618_Perfect_domination","262771386_On_the_Landscape_of_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems","256416957_Efficient_sets_in_graphs","256158063_Bibliography_on_Domination_in_Graphs_and_Some_Basic_Definitions_of_Domination_Parameters","248131117_Towards_a_theory_of_domination_in_graphs","245922366_Die_Theorie_der_Regulren_Graphen","242530161_Linear_time_algorithms_for_np-hard_problems_on_graphs_embedded_in_k-trees","239666729_Hallett_Beyond_NP-completeness_for_problems_of_bounded_width_Hardness_for_the_W-hierarchy","238681204_Linear_algorithms_on_k-terminal_graphs","230596096_The_Theory_of_Graphs","230595897_A_Dynamic_Programming_Approach_to_the_Dominating_Set_Problem_on_k_-Trees","230595838_Characterization_and_Recognition_of_Partial_3-Trees","230595835_Complexity_of_Finding_Embeddings_in_a_k-Tree","230595831_Every_planar_map_is_4-colorable","226592400_Uber_Graphen_und_ihre_Anwendung_auf_Determinantentheorie_und_Mengenlehre","223691012_Planar_3DM_is_NP-complete","223690917_Finite_common_coverings_of_pairs_of_regular_graphs","223120000_Induced_Matchings","222863316_Linear-Time_Computation_of_Optimal_Subgraphs_of_Decomposable_Graphs","222489989_Algorithms_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Graphs","222460352_Easy_Problems_for_Tree-Decomposable_Graphs","222447584_The_monadic_second-order_logic_of_graphs_I_Recognizable_sets_of_finite_graphs","222115289_Seymour_PD_Graph_minors_II_Algorithmic_aspects_of_tree-width_J_Algorithms_73_309-322","221932947_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","221590390_Local_and_Global_Properties_in_Networks_of_Processors_Extended_Abstract","221569508_Finite_automata_bounded_treewidth_and_well-quasiordering","221220100_Practical_Algorithms_on_Partial_k-Trees_with_an_Application_to_Domination-like_Problems","220673151_Complexity_of_Domination-Type_Problems_in_Graphs","220673117_Generalized_Domination_in_Chordal_Graphs","220617300_The_NP-Completeness_of_Edge-Coloring","220569764_Efficient_Sets_in_Partial","220568294_A_Recurrence_Template_for_Several_Parameters_in_Series-parallel_Graphs","220533652_On_Linear_Recognition_of_Tree-Width_at_Most_Four","220431996_Linear-Time_Computability_of_Combinatorial_Problems_on_Series-Parallel_Graphs","220224009_Automatic_Generation_of_Linear-Time_Algorithms_from_Predicate_Calculus_Descriptions_of_Problems_on_Recursively_Constructed_Graph_Families","220152840_Monadic_Second-Order_Evaluations_on_Tree-Decomposable_Graphs","220074910_Finite_common_coverings_of_graphs","2529628_Graph_Algorithms"]}
