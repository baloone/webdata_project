{"id":"338635259_CreativeBioMan_A_Brain-_and_Body-Wearable_Computing-Based_Creative_Gaming_System","abstract":"Current artificial intelligence (AI) technology is used mainly in rational work, i.e., computational and logical analysis. How to best make the machine as aesthetic and creative as humans has gradually gained attention. This article presents a unique, creative game system called CreativeBioMan. This system combines brain wave and multimodal emotion data and uses an AI algorithm for intelligent decision fusion, which can then be used in artistic creation with the goal being to separate the artist from repeated labor creation.","authors":["Min Chen","Yingying Jiang","Yong Cao","Albert Zomaya"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Magazine 6(1):14-22","DOI:10.1109/MSMC.2019.2929312"],"references":["312521072_Bringing_Impressionism_to_Life_with_Neural_Style_Transfer_in_Come_Swim","301841057_Semantic_Style_Transfer_and_Turning_Two-Bit_Doodles_into_Fine_Artworks","281312423_A_Neural_Algorithm_of_Artistic_Style","336814170_A_Creative_Game_Design_and_Programming_App","328508925_Wearable_Affective_Robot","322059822_Be_Your_Own_Prada_Fashion_Synthesis_with_Structural_Coherence","318830523_Fashion_Style_Generator","318716087_Bringing_impressionism_to_life_with_neural_style_transfer_in_Come_Swim","308371872_Automatic_Methods_for_the_Detection_of_Accelerative_Cardiac_Defense_Response","308129451_Multi-Sensor_Fusion_in_Body_Sensor_Networks_State-of-the-art_and_research_challenges","286551751_Real-time_automatic_detection_of_accelerative_cardiac_defense_response","261373973_A_Framework_for_Collaborative_Computing_and_Multi-Sensor_Data_Fusion_in_Body_Sensor_Networks","260623816_Enabling_Effective_Programming_and_Flexible_Management_of_Efficient_Body_Sensor_Network_Applications","46094268_A_Review_of_EEG_ERP_and_Neuroimaging_Studies_of_Creativity_and_Insight","24184880_Brain_correlates_underlying_creative_thinking_EEG_alpha_activity_in_professional_vs_novice_dancers","2853739_Learning_Style_Translation_for_the_Lines_of_a_Drawing"]}
