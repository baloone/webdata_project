{"id":"267099470_Vertex_functions_of_Coulomb_gauge_Yang--Mills_theory","abstract":"The canonical recursive Dyson--Schwinger equations for the three-gluon and\nghost-gluon vertices are solved numerically. The employed truncation includes\nseveral previously neglected diagrams and includes back-coupling effects. We\nfind an infrared finite ghost-gluon vertex and an infrared diverging\nthree-gluon vertex. We also compare our results with those obtained in previous\ncalculations, where bare vertices were used in the loop diagrams.","authors":["Markus Q. Huber","Davide R.
