{"id":"341908505_A_Microservice-Based_Big_Data_Analysis_Platform_for_Online_Educational_Applications","abstract":"The booming development of data science and big data technology stacks has inspired continuous iterative updates of data science research or working methods. At present, the granularity of the labor division between data science and big data is more refined. Traditional work methods, from work infrastructure environment construction to data modelling and analysis of working methods, will greatly delay work and research efficiency. In this paper, we focus on the purpose of the current friendly collaboration of the data science team to build data science and big data analysis application platform based on microservices architecture for education or nonprofessional research field. In the environment based on microservices that facilitates updating the components of each component, the platform has a personal code experiment environment that integrates JupyterHub based on Spark and HDFS for multiuser use and a visualized modelling tools which follow the modular design of data science engineering based on Greenplum in-database analysis. The entire web service system is developed based on spring boot.","authors":["Kehua Miao","Jie Li","Wenxing Hong","Mingtao Chen"],"meta":["June 2020Scientific Programming 2020(239):1-13","DOI:10.1155/2020/6929750"],"references":["332261450_Location-Aware_Web_Service_Composition_Based_on_the_Mixture_Rank_of_Web_Services_and_Web_Service_Requests","322075130_Design_and_Development_of_Backend_Application_for_Public_Complaint_Systems_Using_Microservice_Spring_Boot","321727854_Scalable_and_Soundness_Verifiable_Outsourcing_Computation_in_Marine_Mobile_Computing","320628962_UFBoot2_Improving_the_Ultrafast_Bootstrap_Approximation","318385437_Exploiting_Delay-Aware_Load_Balance_for_Scalable_80211_PSM_in_Crowd_Event_Environments","328613542_Why_Jupyter_is_data_scientists'_computational_notebook_of_choice","325421912_Automated_Repair_of_Internationalization_Presentation_Failures_in_Web_Pages_Using_Style_Similarity_Clustering_and_Search-Based_Techniques","322412643_EasyHPC_An_online_programming_platform_for_learning_high_performance_computing","318221695_Interactive_HPC_Gateways_with_Jupyter_and_Jupyterhub","310810078_Building_a_virtual_system_of_systems_using_docker_swarm_in_multiple_clouds"]}
