{"id":"2559967_Hash_Function_Balance_and_Its_Impact_on_Birthday_Attacks","abstract":"Textbooks tell us that a birthday attack on a hash function h with range size r requires r\n1/2 trials (hash computations) to find a collision. But this is quite misleading, being true only if h is regular, meaning all points in the range have the same number of pre-images under h; if h is not regular, fewer trials may be required. But how much fewer? This paper addresses this question by introducing a measure of the “amount of regularity” of a hash function that we call its balance, and then providing estimates of the success-rate of the birthday attack, and the expected number of trials to find a collision, as a function of the balance of the hash function being attacked. In particular, we will see that the number of trials can be significantly less than r\n1/2 for hash functions of low balance. This leads us to examine popular design principles, such as the MD (Merkle-Damgård) transform, from the point of view of balance preservation, and to mount experiments to determine the balance of popular hash functions.","authors":["Mihir Bellare","Tadayoshi Kohno"],"meta":["May 2003Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3027","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-24676-3_24","Conference: 23rd Annual Eurocrypt ConferenceVolume: 3027"],"references":["233181166_How_to_swindle_Rabin","221354712_A_Design_Principle_for_Hash_Functions","221354656_One_Way_Hash_Functions_and_DES","329322984_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","312627292_Collision-resistant_hashing_Towards_making_UOWHFs_practical","243772991_Cryptography_and_Network_Security_Principles_And_Practices","242494127_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","242391317_The_MD5_Message-digest_Algorithm","240026737_Handbook_of_Applied_CryptographyL_Chapter_6","239418485_Applied_Cryptography_John_Wiley","237132787_One_Way_Functions_and_DES","228580501_Cryptographic_Hash-Function_Basics_Definitions_Implications_and_Separations_for_Preimage_Resistance_Second-Preimage_Resistance_and_Collision_Resistance","222080693_The_Security_of_the_Cipher_Block_Chaining_Message_Authentication_Code","221354641_full_version_Collision-Resistant_Hashing_Towards_Making_UOWHFs_Practical","220689294_Cryptography_Theory_and_Practice","220688034_Introduction_to_Cryptography","220687920_Introduction_to_Cryptography_Principles_and_Applications","220479089_Parallel_Collision_Search_with_Cryptanalytic_Applications","2829058_RIPEMD-160_A_strengthened_version_of_RIPEMD","2596616_Random_Oracles_are_Practical_A_Paradigm_for_Designing_Efficient_Protocols"]}
