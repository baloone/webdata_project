{"id":"229341673_Integrating_public_transportation_in_personalised_electronic_tourist_guides","abstract":"Personalised electronic tourist guides (PETs) are mobile hand-held devices able to create tourist routes matching tourists' preferences. Transportation information has been identified as one of the most appreciated functionalities of a PET. We model the tourist planning problem, integrating public transportation, as the time-dependent team orienteering problem with time windows (TD-TOPTW) in order to allow PETs to create personalised tourist routes in real-time. We develop and compare two different approaches to solve the TD-TOPTW. Experimental results for the city of San Sebastian show that both approaches are able to obtain routes in real-time.","authors":["Ander Garcia","Pieter Vansteenwegen","Olatz Arbelaitz","Wouter Souffriau"],"meta":["March 2013Computers & Operations Research 40(3):-","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2011.03.020"],"references":["246714493_Location-based_Mobile_Tourist_Services_-_First_User_Experiences","230856233_Heuristic_Methods_Applied_to_Orienteering","226088125_Metaheuristics_for_Tourist_Trip_Planning","222385476_Optimal_Strategies_A_New_Assignment_Model_for_Transit_Networks","221357464_CAIPS_A_Context-Aware_Information_Push_Service_in_Tourism","221357412_Behavioural_Impacts_of_Mobile_Tour_Guides","221357338_Personalized_Mobile_City_Transport_Advisory_System","221103374_Finding_time-dependent_shortest_paths_over_large_graphs","220982928_ROSE_Assisting_pedestrians_to_find_preferred_events_and_comfortable_public_transport_connections","220356252_A_Personalized_Tourist_Trip_Design_Algorithm_For_Mobile_Tourist_Guides","220265975_Tourism_and_Mobile_Technology","47842360_Efficient_models_for_timetable_information_in_public_transportation_systems","292060648_Transit_assignment_to_minimal_routes_An_efficient_new_algorithm","285023287_Ant_colony_system_for_team_orienteering_problems_with_time_windows","284145870_Handbook_of_Metaheuristics","269206150_Mobile_tourist_guides","252038738_An_Enhanced_Ant_Colony_System_for_the_Team_Orienteering_Problem_with_Time_Windows","237962624_Experimental_Study_on_SpeedUp_Techniques_for_Timetable_Information_Systems","225814258_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Time-Dependent_Orienteering","223675320_Heuristics_for_the_multi-period_orienteering_problem_with_multiple_time_windows","223226623_Iterated_local_search_for_the_team_orienteering_problem_with_time_windows","223181596_Approximation_algorithms_for_time-dependent_orienteering","222292831_Decremental_state_space_relaxation_strategies_and_initialization_heuristics_for_solving_the_Orienteering_Problem_with_Time_Windows_with_dynamic_programming","221704676_Local_search_in_routing_problems_with_time_windows","221444060_Engineering_Route_Planning_Algorithms","221357251_Intelligent_Routing_System_for_a_Personalised_Electronic_Tourist_Guide","221192646_A_Personal_Tourism_Navigation_System_to_Support_Traveling_Multiple_Destinations_with_Time_Restrictions","221184156_A_Multi-Modal_Agent_Based_Mobile_Route_Advisory_System_for_Public_Transport_Network","220289770_The_orienteering_problem_A_survey","220216378_The_City_Trip_Planner_An_expert_system_for_tourists","28360536_Planning_in_tourism_and_public_transportation_Attraction_selection_by_means_of_a_personalised_electronic_tourist_guide_and_train_transfer_scheduling","3428078_Algorithms_for_Itinerary_Planning_in_Multimodal_Transportation_Networks","2948137_A_Personal_Tourism_Navigation_System_to_Support_Traveling_Multiple","2098230_Iterated_Local_Search"]}
