{"id":"337784291_Ground-to-satellite_quantum_teleportation","abstract":"An arbitrary unknown quantum state cannot be precisely measured or perfectly replicated1. However, quantum teleportation allows faithful transfer of unknown quantum states from one object to another over long distance2, without physical travelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation has been recognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum networks3,4 and distributed quantum computation5,6. However, the previous teleportation experiments between distant locations7-12 were limited to a distance on the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres or terrestrial free-space channels. An outstanding open challenge for a global-scale “quantum internet”13 is to significantly extend the range for teleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satellite platform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote points on the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons’ propagation path is in empty space. Here, we report the first quantum teleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to a low Earth orbit satellite—through an up-link channel—with a distance up to 1400 km. To optimize the link efficiency and overcome the atmospheric turbulence in the up-link, a series of techniques are developed, including a compact ultra-bright source of multi-photon entanglement, narrow beam divergence, high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing, and tracking (APT).","authors":["Jianyu Wang","Ping Xu","Hai-Lin Yong","Liang Zhang"],"meta":["February 2017Nature 549(7670)","DOI:10.1038/nature23675","Project: Quantum Science Satellite"],"references":["312263905_Observation_of_ten-photon_entanglement_using_thin_BiB_3O_6_crystals","309118762_Quantum_teleportation_with_independent_sources_and_prior_entanglement_distribution_over_a_network","306358304_Fundamental_Limit_for_Universal_Entanglement_Detection","304244952_An_efficient_quantum_light-matter_interface_with_sub-second_lifetime","303681421_Quantum_teleportation_across_a_metropolitan_fibre_network","275239910_Optical_Turbulence_Characterization_by_WRF_model_above_Ali_Tibet","261437125_Stochastic_Simulation_of_Quantum_Systems_and_critical_dynamic","259915164_Quantum_teleportation_from_a_telecom-wavelength_photon_to_a_solid-state_quantum_memory","258718290_Site_characterization_studies_in_high_plateau_of_Tibet","232790709_Quantum_teleportation_between_light_and_matter","230804528_Quantum_teleportation_over_143_kilometres_using_active_feed-forward","230638093_Quantum_teleportation_and_entanglement_distribution_over_100-kilometre_free-space_channels","23222626_Experimental_demonstration_of_a_BDCZ_quantum_repeater_node","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","13235592_''Event-ready-detectors''_Bell_experiment_via_entanglement_swapping","13230395_New_High-Intensity_Source_of_Polarization-Entangled_Photon_Pairs","11955500_A_One-Way_Quantum_Computer","2198320_Quantum_teleportation_over_the_Swisscom_telecommunication_network","1924366_Multi-photon_entanglement_and_interferometry","1889586_Memory-built-in_quantum_teleportation_with_photonic_and_atomic_qubits","318123451_Satellite-to-ground_quantum_key_distribution","299428670_Interactive_environment_for_implementation_and_simulation_of_quantum_algorithms","283274861_Loophole-free_Bell_inequality_violation_using_electron_spins_separated_by_13_kilometres","281457917_Quantum_multidimensional_operators_with_many_controls","281457767_Indexed_cluster_of_controlled_computational_operators","281457744_Algorithm_for_switching_4_-_bit_packages_in_full_quantum_network_with_multiple_network_nodes","281457730_Quantum_computing_models_for_algebraic_applications","281457711_Theoretically_optimal_computing_frontiers_for_rapid_multiplication_through_decomposition","281430000_Bilaterally_Symmetrical_Transformation_between_Independent_Operators_and_Rotations","281264784_Reply_to_Flexible_flow_shop_scheduling_optimum_heuristics_and_artificial_intelligence_solutions","280944013_Encoding_and_decoding_of_additional_logic_in_the_phase_space_of_all_operators","278877624_Controlled_formalized_operators_with_multiple_control_bits","278876689_Indexed_formalized_operators_for_n-bit_chains","278873047_Controlled_formalized_operators","278871287_Connecting_sets_of_formalized_operators","276463138_Unitary_combinations_of_formalized_classes_in_qubit_space","270655535_Optically_addressable_nuclear_spins_in_a_solid_with_a_six-hour_coherence_time","258093563_Experimental_Entanglement_Swapping_Entangling_Photons_That_Never_Interacted","241409049_Electrical_Simulation_of_Quantum_Algorithms","234474544_Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-state_analyzer","233835323_Quantum_Repeaters_The_Role_of_Imperfect_Local_Operations_in_Quantum_Communication","231055737_Stochastic_simulation_of_quantum_computation","230811122_Astronomy_World-class_observatory_rising_on_'roof_of_the_world'","228864832_Multiphoton_entanglement_and_interferometry","228109669_A_Single_Quantum_Cannot_be_Cloned","228109505_Experimental_quantum_teleportation","31956533_Demonstrating_the_viability_of_universal_quantum_computation_using_teleportation_and_single-qubit_operations","13231457_Optimal_Extraction_of_Information_from_Finite_Quantum_Ensembles","5291818_The_Quantum_Internet"]}
