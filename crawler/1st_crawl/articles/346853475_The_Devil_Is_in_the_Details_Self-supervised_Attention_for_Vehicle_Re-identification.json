{"id":"346853475_The_Devil_Is_in_the_Details_Self-supervised_Attention_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","abstract":"In recent years, the research community has approached the problem of vehicle re-identification (re-id) with attention-based models, specifically focusing on regions of a vehicle containing discriminative information. These re-id methods rely on expensive key-point labels, part annotations, and additional attributes including vehicle make, model, and color. Given the large number of vehicle re-id datasets with various levels of annotations, strongly-supervised methods are unable to scale across different domains. In this paper, we present Self-supervised Attention for Vehicle Re-identification (SAVER), a novel approach to effectively learn vehicle-specific discriminative features. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SAVER improves upon the state-of-the-art on challenging VeRi, VehicleID, Vehicle-1M and VERI-Wild datasets.","authors":["Pirazh Khorramshahi","Neehar Peri","Jun-Cheng Chen","Rama Chellappa"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-58568-6_22","Conference: European Conference on Computer Vision"],"references":["346777160_Simulating_Content_Consistent_Vehicle_Datasets_with_Attribute_Descent","344914589_Eliminating_cross-camera_bias_for_vehicle_re-identification","338511791_Part-Regularized_Near-Duplicate_Vehicle_Re-Identification","336906206_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","324528700_Joint_Semi-supervised_Learning_and_Re-ranking_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","322060270_Exploiting_Multi-grain_Ranking_Constraints_for_Precisely_Searching_Visually-similar_Vehicles","319236861_PROVID_Progressive_and_Multimodal_Vehicle_Reidentification_for_Large-Scale_Urban_Surveillance","314182267_BoxCars_Improving_Vehicle_Fine-Grained_Recognition_using_3D_Bounding_Boxes_in_Traffic_Surveillance","313097662_Re-ranking_Person_Re-identification_with_k-reciprocal_Encoding","308872089_A_Large-Scale_Car_Dataset_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization_and_Verification","308278517_A_Deep_Learning-Based_Approach_to_Progressive_Vehicle_Re-identification_for_Urban_Surveillance","303760492_Large-scale_vehicle_re-identification_in_urban_surveillance_videos","283471087_SegNet_A_Deep_Convolutional_Encoder-Decoder_Architecture_for_Image_Segmentation","260106785_3D_Object_Representations_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","346577001_Part-Guided_Attention_Learning_for_Vehicle_Instance_Retrieval","340820810_Stripe-based_and_attribute-aware_network_A_two-branch_deep_model_for_vehicle_re-identification","340552656_Bag_of_Tricks_and_a_Strong_Baseline_for_Deep_Person_Re-Identification","339561965_Vehicle_Re-Identification_With_Viewpoint-Aware_Metric_Learning","339558387_A_Dual-Path_Model_With_Adaptive_Attention_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","339558064_PAMTRI_Pose-Aware_Multi-Task_Learning_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification_Using_Highly_Randomized_Synthetic_Data","339332856_Robust_Extensible_and_Fast_Teamed_Classifiers_for_Vehicle_Tracking_in_Multi-Camera_Networks","338510247_CityFlow_A_City-Scale_Benchmark_for_Multi-Target_Multi-Camera_Vehicle_Tracking_and_Re-Identification","336156088_Vehicle_Re-identification_an_Efficient_Baseline_Using_Triplet_Embedding","333419370_VERI-Wild_A_Large_Dataset_and_a_New_Method_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification_in_the_Wild","332452232_Two-Level_Attention_Network_With_Multi-Grain_Ranking_Loss_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","330189113_SphereReID_Deep_Hypersphere_Manifold_Embedding_for_Person_Re-Identification","329750650_Viewpoint-Aware_Attentive_Multi-view_Inference_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","328245919_RAM_A_Region-Aware_Deep_Model_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","323708115_Vehicle_re-identification_by_fusing_multiple_deep_neural_networks","322650282_Group_Sensitive_Triplet_Embedding_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","322059845_Learning_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Vehicle_Re-ID_with_Visual-spatio-Temporal_Path_Proposals","322058942_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","322058472_Orientation_Invariant_Feature_Embedding_and_Spatial_Temporal_Regularization_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","320971287_Re-ranking_Person_Re-identification_with_k-Reciprocal_Encoding","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319569730_Improving_triplet-wise_training_of_convolutional_neural_network_for_vehicle_re-identification","312511634_Deconvolution_and_Checkerboard_Artifacts","311611186_Deep_Relative_Distance_Learning_Tell_the_Difference_between_Similar_Vehicles","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","285648386_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","259400035_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes"]}
