{"id":"290230097_Transition_of_knowledgeskills_requirement_for_entry-level_is_professionals_An_exploratory_study_based_on_recruiters'_perception","abstract":"It has long been recognized that a college graduate with an IS (Information Systems) degree may not be properly equipped with knowledge/skills required for performing an entry-level professional job successfully. Dramatic changes in the U.S economy and offshore outsourcing trends in the IT (Information Technology) industry have been correlated with the recent IT job scarcity and the changing preference of IS recruiters with regard to IS knowledge/skills that their new hires should possess. Keeping pace with these changes presents a major challenge for IS academicians. There is an urgent need for a study which identifies the current knowledge/skill sets required for a new entry-level IS hire. This study reports the findings from a survey of IS recruiters in the U.S., detailing the critical knowledge/skill sets desirable in entry-level IS professionals.","authors":["X.
