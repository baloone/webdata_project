{"id":"353807307_Machine_Learning_Techniques_for_Brain_Stroke_using_MRI","abstract":"Stroke is a neurological disease that occurs when a brain cells die as a result of oxygen and nutrient deficiency. Stroke detection within the first few hours improves the chances to prevent complications and improve health care and management of patients. In addition, significant effect of medications that were used as treatment for stroke would appear only if they were given within the first three hours since the beginning of stroke. Early and accurate diagnosis of stroke improves the probability of positive outcome. Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and is a field of computer science and engineering that facilitates extraction of data based on pattern recognition.. In this review, we offer an insight into the recent developments and applications of Machine Learning in neuroimaging focusing on brain stroke.","authors":["Mithun Sahani H S","Narella Vamshi","Maya B S"],"meta":["March 2020"],"references":["312067495_Efficient_multi-scale_3D_CNN_with_fully_connected_CRF_for_accurate_brain_lesion_segmentation","270658266_A_unified_machine_learning_method_for_task-related_and_resting_state_fMRI_data_analysis","262940316_Predicting_Epileptic_Seizures_in_Advance","236676962_Prediction_and_Control_of_Stroke_by_Data_Mining","225276441_Using_Multivariate_Machine_Learning_Methods_and_Structural_MRI_to_Classify_Childhood_Onset_Schizophrenia_and_Healthy_Controls","334116334_Brain_tumor_classification_using_deep_CNN_features_via_transfer_learning","309120698_American_Heart_Association_Statistics_Committee_and_Stroke_Statistics_Subcommittee","299375650_Different_Medical_Data_Mining_Approaches_Based_Prediction_of_Ischemic_Stroke","268691822_Machine_learning_fMRI_classifier_delineates_subgroups_of_schizophrenia_patients","45199390_Genetics_and_Genomics_of_Stroke_Novel_Approaches","41890635_Designing_an_Artificial_Neural_Network_Model_for_the_Prediction_of_Thrombo-embolic_Stroke"]}
