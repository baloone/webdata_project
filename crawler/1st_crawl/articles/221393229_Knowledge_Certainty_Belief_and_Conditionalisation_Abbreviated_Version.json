{"id":"221393229_Knowledge_Certainty_Belief_and_Conditionalisation_Abbreviated_Version","abstract":"We offer a system to capture the relationship between knowledge and belief, which also sheds new light on each of them in isolation. In the case of knowledge, we strongly reject the property of negative introspection. In the case of belief, we propose a distinction between belief (whose defeasibility is recognized by the agent) and certainty (whose defeasibility is not). The relationship between the three notions - knowledge, certainty, and belief - goes far beyond mere hierarchy. In particular, knowledge has the flavor of belief that is stable under incorporation of correct facts. We explore these first through a model theory, which is based on the notions of the agent's subconscious biases and its conscious preferences (or plausibility measure). We then provide a sound and complete axiomatic system, and point to some of its illuminating properties. We compare our construction to previous ones in AI and philosophy, and in particular point to connections with recent work in AI based on conditionals. (Proofs of our theorems are omitted from this version of the article, hence the subtitle.)","authors":["Philippe Lamarre","Yav Shoham"],"meta":["December 1994","DOI:10.1016/B978-1-4832-1452-8.50134-2","SourceDBLP"],"references":[]}
