{"id":"285846829_The_collapse_of_the_bounded_width_hierarchy","abstract":"We show that every constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) over a fixed constraint language that has bounded relational width\nhas also relational width (2,3). Together with known results this gives a trichotomy: a CSP has either relational width 1,\nor relational width (2,3) (and no smaller relational width), or does not have bounded relational width.\n\nA consequence of this result is that if Γ Γ is a finite constraint language containing relations of arity at most k k, then the CSP over Γ Γ either cannot be solved by a Datalog program, or can be solved by a Datalog program consisting of rules with at most max { 3 , k } max{3,k} variables and at most 2 variables in the head.","authors":["Libor Barto"],"meta":["November 2014Journal of Logic and Computation 26(3)","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exu070"],"references":["280631158_Mal'tsev_conditions_lack_of_absorption_and_solvability","225798240_Existence_theorems_for_weakly_symmetric_operations","225527402_Bounded_width_problems_and_algebras","221025290_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems_with_Infinite_Templates","220617714_Classifying_the_Complexity_of_Constraints_Using_Finite_Algebras","220617670_The_Computational_Structure_of_Monotone_Monadic_SNP_and_Constraint_Satisfaction_A_Study_Through_Datalog_and_Group_Theory","220169357_Omitting_Types_Bounded_Width_and_the_Ability_to_Count","220138885_Robust_Satisfiability_of_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","51969386_Absorbing_Subalgebras_Cyclic_Terms_and_the_Constraint_SatisfactionProblem","51889234_Arc_Consistency_and_Friends","4263853_Tractability_and_learnability_arising_from_algebras_with_few_subpowers","345739443_Constraint_satisfaction_problem_and_universal_algebra","276129144_Characterizations_of_several_Maltsev_conditions","265246761_A_Subalgebra_Intersection_Property_for_Congruence_Distributive_Varieties","265064914_Bounded_relational_width","262294715_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems_Solvable_by_Local_Consistency_Methods","222991995_The_core_of_a_graph","222671216_There_are_no_pure_relational_width_2_constraint_satisfaction_problems","222582563_Combinatorial_problems_raised_from_2-semilattices","221499302_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems_of_Bounded_Width","221025304_Recent_Results_on_the_Algebraic_Approach_to_the_CSP","221025196_Dualities_for_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems"]}
