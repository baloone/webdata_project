{"id":"314904427_Image_Processing_in_the_Semidiscrete_Group_of_Rototranslations","abstract":"It is well-known, since [12], that cells in the primary visual cortex V1 do much more than merely signaling position in the visual field: most cortical cells signal the local orientation of a contrast edge or bar â€“ they are tuned to a particular local orientation. This orientation tuning has been given a mathematical interpretation in a sub-Riemannian model by Petitot, Citti, and Sarti [6, 14]. According to this model, the primary visual cortex V1 lifts grey-scale images, given as functions \\(f:{\\mathbb R}^2\\rightarrow [0,1]\\), to functions Lf defined on the projectivized tangent bundle of the plane \\(PT\\mathbb R^2 = \\mathbb R^2\\times \\mathbb P^1\\). Recently, in [1], the authors presented a promising semidiscrete variant of this model where the Euclidean group of rototranslations SE(2), which is the double covering of \\(PT\\mathbb R^2\\), is replaced by SE(2, N), the group of translations and discrete rotations. In particular, in [15], an implementation of this model allowed for state-of-the-art image inpaintings.","authors":["Dario Prandi","Ugo Boscain","Gauthier Jean-Paul"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-25040-3_67","Conference: International Conference on Networked Geometric Science of Information"],"references":["272817648_Highly_Corrupted_Image_Inpainting_Through_Hypoelliptic_Diffusion","271964896_Image_Reconstruction_Via_Non-Isotropic_Diffusion_in_DubinsReed-Shepp-_Like_Control_Systems","265894604_Left-invariant_parabolic_evolutions_on_SE2_and_contour_enhancement_via_invertible_orientation_scores_Part_I_Linear_left-invariant_diffusion_equations_on_SE2","236124653_Hypoelliptic_Diffusion_and_Human_Vision_A_Semidiscrete_New_Twist","233076257_Polyspectra_as_measures_of_sound_texture_and_timbre","220808761_A_New_Simulation_of_Spiral_Architecture","316807354_Abstract_Harmonic_Analysis","278619418_Hypoelliptic_diffusion_and_human_vision_a_semi-discrete_new_twist_on_the_Petitot_theory","272844336_Neurogeometrie_de_la_vision_-_Modeles_mathematiques_et_physiques_des_architectures_fonctionnelles","230675350_Receptive_Fields_of_Single_Neurons_in_the_Cat's_Striate_Cortex"]}
