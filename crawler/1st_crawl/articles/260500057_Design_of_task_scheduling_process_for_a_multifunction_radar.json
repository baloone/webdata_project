{"id":"260500057_Design_of_task_scheduling_process_for_a_multifunction_radar","abstract":"During the operation of the multifunction radar system, all the tasks related to the functions of the radar must be launched. The key element of the radar responsible for managing all these tasks is the task scheduler. Many scheduling techniques give good results at the expense of too complex and expensive designs. This study presents the results of a model for a radar task scheduler to achieve both a simple design and a good performance. The scheduling process consists of three stages in which the whole scheduling is divided into: task priorisation, scheduling algorithm and temporal planning. A task priority method is established to be applied to the tasks and the scheduling algorithms that have been tested based on this criterion for the priority task queue building. The authors have developed a software platform for testing all scheduling algorithms. The evaluation of the schedulers was made based on a set of features of the radar to measure the system's performance from the timing and the tasks execution. The authors offer a model to test the global radar system focusing on the task scheduler. This way allows us to analyse different scheduling algorithms and policies, and applying specifically scheduling policies that give priority to the most important and critical tasks.","authors":["M.I.
