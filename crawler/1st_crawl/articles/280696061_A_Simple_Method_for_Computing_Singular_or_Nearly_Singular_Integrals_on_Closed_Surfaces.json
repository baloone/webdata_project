{"id":"280696061_A_Simple_Method_for_Computing_Singular_or_Nearly_Singular_Integrals_on_Closed_Surfaces","abstract":"We present a simple, accurate method for computing singular or nearly\nsingular integrals on a smooth, closed surface, such as layer potentials for\nharmonic functions evaluated at points on or near the surface. The integral is\ncomputed with a regularized kernel and corrections are added for regularization\nand discretization, which are found from analysis near the singular point. The\nsurface integrals are computed from a new quadrature rule using surface points\nwhich project onto grid points in coordinate planes. The method does not\nrequire coordinate charts on the surface or special treatment of the\nsingularity other than the corrections. The accuracy is about $O(h^3)$, where\n$h$ is the spacing in the background grid, uniformly with respect to the point\nof evaluation, on or near the surface. Improved accuracy is obtained for points\non the surface. The treecode of Duan and Krasny for Ewald summation is used to\nperform sums. Numerical examples are presented with a variety of surfaces.","authors":["J. Thomas Beale","Wenjun Ying","Jason R.
