{"id":"338614861_OFDM_VLC_System_Based_on_Virtual_Instrumentation_and_SDR","abstract":"This paper covers our second version of visible light communication system, which was based on orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing. Whole platform is implemented in LabVIEW and is running on National Instruments software defined radios. Its design is thoroughly explained, and a number of measurements is presented. Certain limitations are described, and upgrade paths are mentioned as well.","authors":["Lukas Danys","Radek Martinek","Rene Jaros","Jan Baro≈°"],"meta":["January 2019IFAC-PapersOnLine 52(27):453-458","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.12.705"],"references":["261038794_An_Experimental_Comparison_Between_Different_Technologies_Arising_for_Public_Lighting_LED_Luminaires_Replacing_High_Pressure_Sodium_Lamps","2995690_Wireless_In-House_Data_Communication_via_Diffuse_Infrared_Radiation","315865807_Interference_analysis_of_IEEE_80211_wireless_networks_A_case_study_of_Namibia_University_of_Science_and_Technology","290967311_Microwave_capacity_evolution","3244497_History_Development_and_Applications_of_High-Brightness_Visible_Light-Emitting_Diodes"]}
