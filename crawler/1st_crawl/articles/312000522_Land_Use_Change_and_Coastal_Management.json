{"id":"312000522_Land_Use_Change_and_Coastal_Management","abstract":"Land use change is a process by which human activities transform the natural landscape, referring to how land has been used, usually emphasizing the functional role of land for economic activities. Land use changes are often nonlinear and might trigger feedbacks to the system, stress living conditions, and threaten people with vulnerability . Therefore, not only do land use change trajectories need assessment, but also possible future conditions must be projected for certain assumptions, both basic to ensuring sustainable conditions. The primary aim of this chapter is to provide an analysis of coastal land use changes in Bangladesh by presenting temporal variations of land use changes in the coastal Bangladesh along with contemporary uses of coastal land. The chapter also includes a discussion of drivers of coastal land use changes as well as a discussion of coastal management efforts undertaken in Bangladesh.","authors":["Bimal Kanti Paul","Harun Rashid"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-805276-1.00006-5","In book: Climatic Hazards in Coastal Bangladesh (pp.183-207)"],"references":["227604641_Conservation_and_management_of_the_Bangladesh_coastal_ecosystem_Overview_of_an_integrated_approach"]}
