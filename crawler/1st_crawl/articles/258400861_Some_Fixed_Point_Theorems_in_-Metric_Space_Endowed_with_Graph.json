{"id":"258400861_Some_Fixed_Point_Theorems_in_-Metric_Space_Endowed_with_Graph","abstract":"We define some notions of contraction mappings in -metric space endowed with a graph and subsequently establish some fixed point results for such classes of contractions. According to the applications of our results, we obtain fixed point theorems for cyclic operators and an existence theorem for the solution of an integral equation.","authors":["Maria Samreen","Tayyab Kamran","Naseer Shahzad"],"meta":["January 2013Abstract and Applied Analysis 2013(2)","DOI:10.1155/2013/967132"],"references":["279889462_A_fixed_point_theorem_in_partially_ordered_sets_and_some_application_to_matrix_equations","268663924_Fixed_point_results_for_generalized_a-Contraction_on_a_set_with_two_metrics","267172176_Ulam-Hyers_Stability_for_Operatorial_Equations","267149775_Sequences_of_operators_and_fixed_points_in_quasimetric_spaces","267145115_Generalized_contractions_in_partially_ordered_Metric_spaces","284091802_Some_results_of_fixed_points","268670132_Nonlinear_set-valued_contraction_mappings_in_B-metric_spaces","268607514_Fixed-point_theorems","267173698_A_fixed_point_result_for_ph-contractions_on_b-metric_spaces_without_the_boundedness_assumption","267078308_Some_remarks_concerning_Ciric-Reich-Rus_operators"]}
