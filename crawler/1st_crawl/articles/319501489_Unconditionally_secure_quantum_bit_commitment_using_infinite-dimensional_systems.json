{"id":"319501489_Unconditionally_secure_quantum_bit_commitment_using_infinite-dimensional_systems","abstract":"Unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment (QBC) was considered impossible. But the no-go proofs are based on the Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters (HJW) theorem. Recently it was found that some states in infinite-dimensional systems do not obey the HJW theorem. Based on this finding, here we propose a simple QBC protocol which manages to evade the no-go proofs.","authors":["Guang Ping He"],"meta":["September 2017"],"references":["319151672_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_and_the_Reality_of_the_Quantum_State","311761902_Probabilistic_theories_with_purification_phys","305983582_Spookyfying_Quantum_Information_is_Impossible","2620245_Is_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Really_Possible","2330926_The_Trouble_with_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","2203019_Defeating_classical_bit_commitments_with_a_quantum_computer","2201608_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_is_Impossible","2191295_Remote_preparation_of_arbitrary_ensembles_and_quantum_bit_commitment","2189477_Superselection_Rules_in_Quantum_Cryptography","233836053_An_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Protocol","222457508_A_complete_classification_of_quantum_ensembles_having_a_given_density_matrix","45852978_A_short_impossibility_proof_of_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","45852596_Strong_no-go_theorem_for_Gaussian_quantum_bit_commitment","2202389_Making_An_Empty_Promise_With_A_Quantum_Computer","2201590_Why_quantum_bit_commitment_and_ideal_quantum_coin_tossing_are_impossible","2197567_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_with_Secret_Parameters"]}
