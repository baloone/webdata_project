{"id":"228995742_Noise_estimation_in_remote_sensing_imagery_using_data_masking","abstract":"Estimation of noise contained within a remote sensing image is essen-tial in order to counter the effects of noise contamination. The application of convolution data-masking techniques can effectively portray the influence of noise. In this paper, we describe the performance of a developed noise-estimation tech-nique using data masking in the presence of simulated additive and multiplicative noise. The estimation method employs Laplacian and gradient data masks, and takes advantage of the correlation properties typical of remote sensing imagery. The technique is applied to typical textural images that serve to demonstrate its effectiveness. The algorithm is tested using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-C) imagery. The algorithm compares favourably with existing noise-estimation techniques under low to moderate noise conditions.","authors":["B. R. Corner","Ram M.
