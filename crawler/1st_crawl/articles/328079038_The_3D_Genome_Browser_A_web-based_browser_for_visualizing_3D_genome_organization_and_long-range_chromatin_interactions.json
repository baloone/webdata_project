{"id":"328079038_The_3D_Genome_Browser_A_web-based_browser_for_visualizing_3D_genome_organization_and_long-range_chromatin_interactions","abstract":"Here, we introduce the 3D Genome Browser, http://3dgenome.org, which allows users to conveniently explore both their own and over 300 publicly available chromatin interaction data of different types. We design a new binary data format for Hi-C data that reduces the file size by at least a magnitude and allows users to visualize chromatin interactions over millions of base pairs within seconds. Our browser provides multiple methods linking distal cis-regulatory elements with their potential target genes. Users can seamlessly integrate thousands of other omics data to gain a comprehensive view of both regulatory landscape and 3D genome structure.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13059-018-1519-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","authors":["Yanli Wang","Fan Song","Bo Zhang","Lijun Zhang"],"meta":["October 2018Genome Biology 19(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13059-018-1519-9"],"references":["345744987_The_3D_Genome_Browser_a_web-based_browser_for_visualizing_3D_genome_organization_and_long-range_chromatin_interactions","327216988_HiGlass_Web-based_visual_exploration_and_analysis_of_genome_interaction_maps","324970654_An_Integrative_Framework_For_Detecting_Structural_Variations_In_Cancer_Genomes","321915244_Delta_a_new_Web-based_3D_genome_visualization_and_analysis_platform","320532525_Identification_of_copy_number_variations_and_translocations_in_cancer_cells_from_Hi-C_data","320515830_Multiscale_3D_Genome_Rewiring_during_Mouse_Neural_Development","319115617_Lineage-specific_dynamic_and_pre-established_enhancer-promoter_contacts_cooperate_in_terminal_differentiation","325641487_Higher-Order_Inter-chromosomal_Hubs_Shape_3D_Genome_Organization_in_the_Nucleus","320329123_Cohesin_Loss_Eliminates_All_Loop_Domains","319596164_Static_and_Dynamic_DNA_Loops_form_AP-1-Bound_Activation_Hubs_during_Macrophage_Development","318235017_Cell-cycle_dynamics_of_chromosomal_organization_at_single-cell_resolution","318152939_The_methyltransferase_SETDB1_regulates_a_large_neuron-specific_topological_chromatin_domain","315794510_Linkages_between_changes_in_the_3D_organization_of_the_genome_and_transcription_during_myotube_differentiation_in_vitro","314306556_Complex_multi-enhancer_contacts_captured_by_genome_architecture_mapping","314218983_Nucleome_Analysis_Reveals_Structure-Function_Relationships_for_Colon_Cancer"]}
