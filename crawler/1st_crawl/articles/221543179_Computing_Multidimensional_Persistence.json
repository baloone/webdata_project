{"id":"221543179_Computing_Multidimensional_Persistence","abstract":"The theory of multidimensional persistence captures the topology of a\nmultifiltration -- a multiparameter family of increasing spaces.\nMultifiltrations arise naturally in the topological analysis of scientific\ndata. In this paper, we give a polynomial time algorithm for computing\nmultidimensional persistence. We recast this computation as a problem within\ncomputational algebraic geometry and utilize algorithms from this area to solve\nit. While the resulting problem is Expspace-complete and the standard\nalgorithms take doubly-exponential time, we exploit the structure inherent\nwithing multifiltrations to yield practical algorithms. We implement all\nalgorithms in the paper and provide statistical experiments to demonstrate\ntheir feasibility.","authors":["Gunnar Carlsson","Gurjeet Singh","Afra Zomorodian"],"meta":["December 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-10631-6_74","SourceDBLP","Conference: Algorithms and Computation, 20th International Symposium, ISAAC 2009, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, December 16-18, 2009.
