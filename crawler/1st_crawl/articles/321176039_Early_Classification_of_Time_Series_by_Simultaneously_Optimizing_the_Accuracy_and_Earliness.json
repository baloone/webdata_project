{"id":"321176039_Early_Classification_of_Time_Series_by_Simultaneously_Optimizing_the_Accuracy_and_Earliness","abstract":"The problem of early classification of time series appears naturally in contexts where the data, of temporal nature, are collected over time, and early class predictions are interesting or even required. The objective is to classify the incoming sequence as soon as possible, while maintaining suitable levels of accuracy in the predictions. Thus, we can say that the problem of early classification consists of optimizing two objectives simultaneously: accuracy and earliness. In this context, we present a method for early classification based on combining a set of probabilistic classifiers together with a stopping rule (SR). This SR will act as a trigger and will tell us when to output a prediction or when to wait for more data, and its main novelty lies in the fact that it is built by explicitly optimizing a cost function based on accuracy and earliness. We have selected a large set of benchmark data sets and four other state-of-the-art early classification methods, and we have evaluated and compared our framework obtaining superior results in terms of both earliness and accuracy.","authors":["Usue Mori","Alexander Mendiburu","Sanjoy Dasgupta","Jose Lozano"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems PP(99):1-10","DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2764939"],"references":["301740463_Reliable_early_classification_of_time_series_based_on_discriminating_the_classes_over_time","283548591_Early_Classification_of_Time_Series_as_a_Non_Myopic_Sequential_Decision_Making_Problem","278734004_Multivariate_Time-Series_Classification_Using_the_Hidden-Unit_Logistic_Model","276422351_Using_dynamic_time_warping_distances_as_features_for_improved_time_series_classification","265553007_Classifying_With_Confidence_From_Incomplete_Information","265134274_Automated_detection_of_physiologic_deterioration_in_hospitalized_patients","259312690_Classifiers_With_a_Reject_Option_for_Early_Time-Series_Classification","257428155_GA_A_Package_for_Genetic_Algorithms_in_R","251403730_Early_classification_on_time_series","221252790_Classification_of_Household_Devices_by_Electricity_Usage_Profiles","220907007_Extracting_Interpretable_Features_for_Early_Classification_on_Time_Series","220343837_Classification_of_Multivariate_Time_Series_and_Structured_Data_Using_Constructive_Induction","220283670_Real-time_classification_of_variable_length_multi-attribute_motions","45920261_On_Recursive_Edit_Distance_Kernels_With_Application_to_Time_Series_Classification","5842633_vbmp_Variational_Bayesian_Multinomial_Probit_Regression_for_multi-class_classification_in_R","2594015_Probabilistic_Outputs_for_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Comparisons_to_Regularized_Likelihood_Methods","316800935_Introduction_to_Evolutionary_Algorithms","314870801_Natural_Computing_Series","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","281781221_On_the_stopping_criteria_for_k-Nearest_Neighbor_in_positive_unlabeled_time_series_classification_problems","274622214_Early_classification_on_multivariate_time_series","266660454_Utilizing_temporal_patterns_for_estimating_uncertainty_in_interpretable_early_decision_making","261210220_Early_classification_of_multivariate_time_series_using_a_hybrid_HMMSVM_model","235710084_Evolutionary_Computation_2---Advanced_Algorithms_and_Operators","221654342_Semi-supervised_time_series_classification","221275044_Early_Fault_Classification_in_Dynamic_Systems_Using_Case-Based_Reasoning","220520085_A_Brief_Survey_on_Sequence_Classification","220451838_Time_Series_Shapelets_A_Novel_Technique_that_Allows_Accurate_Interpretable_and_Fast_Classification"]}
