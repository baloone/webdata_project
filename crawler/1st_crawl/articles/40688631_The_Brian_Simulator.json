{"id":"40688631_The_Brian_Simulator","abstract":"\"Brian\" is a simulator for spiking neural networks (http://www.briansimulator.org). The focus is on making the writing of simulation code as quick and easy as possible for the user, and on flexibility: new and non-standard models are no more difficult to define than standard ones. This allows scientists to spend more time on the details of their models, and less on their implementation. Neuron models are defined by writing differential equations in standard mathematical notation, facilitating scientific communication. Brian is written in the Python programming language, and uses vector-based computation to allow for efficient simulations. It is particularly useful for neuroscientific modelling at the systems level, and for teaching computational neuroscience.","authors":["Dan F M Goodman","Romain Brette"],"meta":["September 2009Frontiers in Neuroscience 3(2):192-7","DOI:10.3389/neuro.01.026.2009","SourcePubMed"],"references":["319253881_The_Book_of_GENESIS","23986168_PyNEST_a_convenient_interface_to_the_NEST_simulator","23986162_Neuron_and_Python","23980966_PyNN_A_Common_Interface_for_Neuronal_Network_Simulators","23712221_Brian_A_Simulator_for_Spiking_Neural_Networks_in_Python","281203447_Simulation_of_networks_of_spiking_neurons_A_review_of_tools_and_strategies","262293516_GPGPU_General_purpose_computation_on_graphics_hardware","225644006_Condor-G_A_Computation_Management_Agent_for_Multi-Institutional_Grids","220579958_NEST_neural_simulation_tool","23368557_A_Place_Theory_Of_Sound_Localization"]}
