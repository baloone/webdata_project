{"id":"332342806_Bisplit_graphs_satisfy_the_Chen-Chvatal_conjecture","abstract":"In this paper, we give a lengthy proof of a small result! A graph is bisplit if its vertex set can be partitioned into three stable sets with two of them inducing a complete bipartite graph. We prove that these graphs satisfy the Chen-Chv√°tal conjecture: their metric space (in the usual sense) has a universal line (in an unusual sense) or at least as many lines as the number of vertices.","authors":["Laurent Beaudou","Giacomo Kahn","Matthieu Rosenfeld"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":["270222425_Lines_Betweenness_and_Metric_Spaces","221660734_A_De_Bruijn-Erdos_Theorem_for_Chordal_Graphs","304163821_A_New_Class_of_Graphs_That_Satisfies_the_Chen-Chvatal_Conjecture","257144032_Personal_reminiscences_and_remarks_on_the_mathematical_work_of_Tibor_Gallai","220570058_Problems_related_to_a_de_Bruijn-Erdos_theorem","2131671_Problems_related_to_a_de_Bruijn_-_ErdHos_theorem"]}
