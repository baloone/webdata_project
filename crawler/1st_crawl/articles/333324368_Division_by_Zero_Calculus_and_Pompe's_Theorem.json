{"id":"333324368_Division_by_Zero_Calculus_and_Pompe's_Theorem","abstract":"In this paper, we will introduce the application of the division by zero calculus to geometry and it will show the power of the new calculus. Keywords. Division by zero calculus, 0/0 = 1/0 = z/0 = 0, Laurent expansion, Pompe's example.","authors":["Tsutomu Matsuura","Hiroshi Okumura","S.
