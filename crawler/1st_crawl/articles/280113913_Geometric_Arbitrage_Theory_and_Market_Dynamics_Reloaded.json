{"id":"280113913_Geometric_Arbitrage_Theory_and_Market_Dynamics_Reloaded","abstract":"This paper is essentially a new version of the published article, where some flaws have been amended. We have embedded the classical theory of stochastic finance into a differential geometric framework called Geometric Arbitrage Theory and show that it is possible to:\n\n• Write arbitrage as curvature of a principal fibre bundle.\n• Parameterize arbitrage strategies by its holonomy.\n• Give the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing a differential homotopic characterization.\n• Characterize Geometric Arbitrage Theory by five principles and show they they are\nconsistent with the classical theory of stochastic finance.\n• Derive for a closed market the equilibrium solution for market portfolio and dynamics in\nthe cases where:\n– Arbitrage is allowed but minimized.\n– Arbitrage is not allowed.\n• Prove that the no-free-lunch-with-vanishing-risk condition implies the zero curvature condition. \n• If the Novikov condition for the SDE describing the asset dynamics is satisfied, so is the no-free-lunch-with-vanishing-risk condition.","authors":["Simone Farinelli"],"meta":["July 2021The Journal of Geometric Mechanics Vol. 7(No. 4)","DOI:10.3934/jgm.2015.7.431","Project: Geometric Arbitrage Theory"],"references":["304557144_Gauge_invariance_geometry_and_arbitrage","339380215_Arbitrage_Theory_in_Continuous_Time","321876999_The_Mathematics_of_Arbitrage","316268137_Stochastische_Analysis","316239175_Universitext","299659729_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","292191458_Optimal_investment_in_incomplete_markets_when_wealth_may_become_negative","268247800_An_introduction_to_the_analysis_of_paths_on_a_Riemannian_manifold","268065732_The_mechanics_and_thermodynamics_of_continuous_media","265562369_Stochastic_calculus_in_manifolds_With_an_appendix_by_PA_Meyer"]}
