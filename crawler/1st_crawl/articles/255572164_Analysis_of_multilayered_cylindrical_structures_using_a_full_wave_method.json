{"id":"255572164_Analysis_of_multilayered_cylindrical_structures_using_a_full_wave_method","abstract":"Abstractâ€”In this paper, Wave Concept Iterative Procedure (WCIP) is used to investigate scattering by multilayered cylindrical structures in free space and to calculate the diffracted far field by adopting a cylindrical coordinate formulation. The WCIP principle consists of alternating waves between the modal and space domains. Its iterative resolution process is always convergent in lossless media case. The proposed technique used for determining the electric far field diffracted by a multilayered cylindrical structure is validated and confronted to literature results.","authors":["Noemen Ammar","Taoufik Aguili","Henri Baudrand"],"meta":["January 2008Progress In Electromagnetics Research 85:425-438","DOI:10.2528/PIER08091803"],"references":["290670760_Investigation_of_electromagnetic_scattering_by_arbitrarily_shaped_structures_using_the_wave_concept_iterative_process","255603001_Ultra_wide_band_RCS_optimization_of_multilayered_cylindrical_structures_for_arbitrarily_polarized_incident_plane_waves","255601438_Error_estimation_of_the_Method_of_Auxiliary_Sources_MAS_for_scattering_from_an_impedance_circular_cylinder","245439880_Scattering_From_Multiple_Bianisotropic_Cylinders_and_Their_Modeling_of_Cylindrical_Objects_of_Arbitrary_Cross-Section_-_Abstract","245380433_Arbitrary_Currents_on_Circular_Cylinder_with_Inhomogeneous_Cladding_and_RCS_Optimization","255595294_A_new_single_surface_integral_equation_for_light_scattering_by_circular_dielectric_cylinders","254234774_Scattering_Analysis_of_Dielectric_Coated_Cones","246041485_Electromagnetic_Scattering_by_a_Conducting_Cylinder_Coated_with_Metamaterials","245380387_Image_Reconstruction_of_Arbitrary_Cross_Section_Conducting_Cylinder_Using_UWB_Pulse","245380241_Hollow_Cylinder_Microwave_Model_for_Stems"]}
