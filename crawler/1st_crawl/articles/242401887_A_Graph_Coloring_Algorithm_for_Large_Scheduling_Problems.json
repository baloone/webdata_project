{"id":"242401887_A_Graph_Coloring_Algorithm_for_Large_Scheduling_Problems","abstract":"A new graph coloring algorithm is presented and compared to a wide variety of known algorithms. The algorithm is shown to exhibit O(n**2) time behavior for most sparse graphs and is found to be particularly well suited for use with large-scale scheduling problems. In addition, a procedure for generating large random test graphs with known chromatic number is presented and is used to evaluate heuristically the capabilities of the algorithms discussed.","authors":["Frank Thomson Leighton"],"meta":["November 1979Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards (United States) 84(6)","DOI:10.6028/jres.084.024"],"references":["275983343_The_Four_Color_Problem","265367157_Graph_theory_An_algorithmic_approach","262493823_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","256743561_An_Inequality_for_the_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Graph","238654445_Graph_Colouring_Algorithms_In_Graph_Theory_and_Computing","235439188_A_system_for_computing_university_examination_timetables","234792391_The_Complexity_of_Near-Optimal_Graph_Coloring","229964546_Bounded_color_functions_on_graphs","228057776_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Problems","220427088_Scheduling_university_course_examinations_by_computer","220425284_Algorithm_286_Examination_scheduling","220420395_Final_examination_scheduling","31422325_A_technique_for_coloring_a_graph_applicable_to_large_scale_time-tabling_problems","30955665_An_upper_Bound_to_the_chromatic_number_of_a_graph_and_its_application_to_timetabling_problems"]}
