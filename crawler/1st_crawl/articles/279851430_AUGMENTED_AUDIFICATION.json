{"id":"279851430_AUGMENTED_AUDIFICATION","abstract":"We present a sonification method that blends between audification\nand auditory graphs which we call ”Augmented Audification”.\nIt is based on a combination of single-side-band modulation\nand a pitch modulation of the original data stream. Benefits\ninclude the flexible adjustment of the sonification’s frequency\nrange to the human hearing range and the possibility to interactively\nzoom into the data set at any scale. The paper introduces\nthe method by three examples: deterministic harmonic complexes,\nrandom signal analysis, and seismology.","authors":["Robert Höldrich","Katharina Groß-Vogt"],"meta":["July 2015","Conference: International Conference on Auditory Display, Graz, Austria 2015"],"references":["215639368_Analysing_Time_Series_Data","263964268_Auditory_Display_Sonification_Audification_and_Auditory_Interfaces","241339634_Seismometer_Sounds","233845317_Monotone_Piecewise_Cubic_Interpolation","230554867_The_Computer_Music_Tutorial","228349294_Thirteen_Years_of_Reflection_on_Auditory_Graphing_Promises_Pitfalls_and_Potential_New_Directions","213799543_Sonification_Sandbox_Reconstruction_Software_standard_for_auditory_graphs","213798712_Toward_a_data_sonification_design_space_map"]}
