{"id":"236936122_Classical_simulation_complexity_of_extended_Clifford_circuits","abstract":"Clifford gates are a winsome class of quantum operations combining\nmathematical elegance with physical significance. The Gottesman-Knill theorem\nasserts that Clifford computations can be classically efficiently simulated but\nthis is true only in a suitably restricted setting. Here we consider Clifford\ncomputations with a variety of additional ingredients: (a) strong vs. weak\nsimulation, (b) inputs being computational basis states vs. general product\nstates, (c) adaptive vs. non-adaptive choices of gates for circuits involving\nintermediate measurements, (d) single line outputs vs. multi-line outputs. We\nconsider the classical simulation complexity of all combinations of these\ningredients and show that many are not classically efficiently simulatable\n(subject to common complexity assumptions such as P not equal to NP). Our\nresults reveal a surprising proximity of classical to quantum computing power\nviz. a class of classically simulatable quantum circuits which yields universal\nquantum computation if extended by a purely classical additional ingredient\nthat does not extend the class of quantum processes occurring.","authors":["Richard Jozsa","Maarten Van den Nest"],"meta":["May 2013Quantum Information & Computation 14(7)","SourcearXiv"],"references":["232244462_Classical_simulations_of_Abelian-group_normalizer_circuits_with_intermediate_measurements","226909283_The_Invariants_of_the_Clifford_Groups","48208822_A_linearized_stabilizer_formalism_for_systems_of_finite_dimension","32892378_Measurement-based_quantum_computation_on_cluster_states","24173834_Computational_Power_of_Correlations","11955500_A_One-Way_Quantum_Computer","2195248_Fast_simulation_of_stabilizer_circuits_using_a_graph_state_representation","2193613_Stabilizer_states_and_Clifford_operations_for_systems_of_arbitrary_dimensions_and_modular_arithmetic","2188101_Adaptive_Quantum_Computation_Constant_Depth_Quantum_Circuits_and_Arthur-Merlin_Games","2185054_Quantum_computing_via_measurements_only","292136813_Universal_quantum_computation_with_ideal_Clifford_gates_and_noisy_ancillas","245575173_A_linear_stabilizer_formalism_for_systems_of_any_finite_dimension","221659392_Efficient_classical_simulations_of_Quantum_Fourier_transforms_and_normalizer_circuits_over_Abelian_groups","220693968_Computational_Complexity_A_Modern_Approach","220436082_Adptive_quantum_computation_constant_depth_quantum_circuits_and_Arthur-Merlin_games","220436013_Simulating_quantum_computers_with_probabilistic_methods","220435952_Classical_Simulation_of_Quantum_Computation_the_Gottesmann-Knill_theorem_and_Slightly_Beyond","220435891_Generalized_Clifford_groups_and_simulation_of_associated_quantum_circuits","45916527_Classical_simulation_of_commuting_quantum_computations_implies_collapse_of_the_polynomial_hierarchy","2203092_The_Heisenberg_Representation_of_Quantum_Computers","2202673_Fault-Tolerant_Quantum_Computation_with_Higher-Dimensional_Systems","2202154_Stabilizer_Codes_and_Quantum_Error_Correction","2200413_Generalised_Clifford_groups_and_simulation_of_associated_quantum_circuits","2194483_Quantum_Computing_Postselection_and_Probabilistic_Polynomial-Time","2193117_Improved_Simulation_of_Stabilizer_Circuits","2192340_Universal_quantum_computation_with_ideal_Clifford_gates_and_noisy_ancillas","2190180_The_Clifford_group_stabilizer_states_and_linear_and_quadratic_operations_over_GF2","1920963_Matchgates_and_classical_simulation_of_quantum_circuits"]}
