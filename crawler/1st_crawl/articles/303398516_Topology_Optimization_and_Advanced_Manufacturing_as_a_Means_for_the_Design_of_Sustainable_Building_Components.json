Topology optimization is a mathematical, gradient-based design procedure that can be used to determine the distribution of required material within a design domain based upon defined loads and boundary conditions while meeting a prescribed target objective, such as minimizing deflection. The concept of topology optimization has been utilized by the automotive and aerospace industry for almost thirty years now, since its early development, where problems associated with solutions meant to satisfy maximum stiffness with minimum weight are of the utmost importance.","authors":["Mark Donofrio"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Engineering 145:638-645","DOI:10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.054"],"references":["227570476_New_Structuralism_Design_Engineering_and_Architectural_Technologies"]}
