{"id":"263238072_Z2Z4-additive_cyclic_codes_generator_polynomials_and_dual_codes","abstract":"A ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2{\\mathbb{Z}}_4$-additive code ${\\cal\nC}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{Z}}_2^\\alpha\\times{\\mathbb{Z}}_4^\\beta$ is called cyclic\ncode if the set of coordinates can be partitioned into two subsets, the set of\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$ and the set of ${\\mathbb{Z}}_4$ coordinates, such that any\ncyclic shift of the coordinates of both subsets leaves invariant the code.\nThese codes can be identified as submodules of the $\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$-module\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(x^\\alpha-1)\\times\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]/(x^\\beta-1)$. The parameters\nof a ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2{\\mathbb{Z}}_4$-additive cyclic code are stated in terms of\nthe degrees of the generator polynomials of the code. The generator polynomials\nof the dual code of a ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2{\\mathbb{Z}}_4$-additive cyclic code are\ndetermined in terms of the generator polynomials of the code ${\\cal C}$.","authors":["Joaquim Borges","Cristina Fernández-Córdoba","Roger Ten-Valls"],"meta":["June 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["308603176_24-additive_cyclic_codes","278114792_-Additive_Cyclic_Codes","260780408_Z2Z4-linear_codes_generator_matrices_and_duality","257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","241438519_The_Z_4_Linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_Related_Codes","313573945_Maximum_distance_q-nary_codes","265586948_Characterization_and_constructions_of_self-dual_codes_over_Z_2_Z_4","265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes"]}
