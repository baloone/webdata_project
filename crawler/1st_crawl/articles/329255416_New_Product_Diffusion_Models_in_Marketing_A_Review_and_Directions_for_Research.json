{"id":"329255416_New_Product_Diffusion_Models_in_Marketing_A_Review_and_Directions_for_Research","abstract":"Since the publication of the Bass model in 1969, research on the modeling of the diffusion of innovations has resulted in a body of literature consisting of several dozen articles, books, and assorted other publications. Attempts have been made to reexamine the structural and conceptual assumptions and estimation issues underlying the diffusion models of new product acceptance. The authors evaluate these developments for the past two decades. They conclude with a research agenda to make diffusion models theoretically more sound and practically more effective and realistic.","authors":["Vijay Mahajan","Eitan Muller","Frank M.
