{"id":"300020081_On_Real-Time_Monitoring_with_Imprecise_Timestamps","abstract":"Existing real-time monitoring approaches assume traces with precise timestamps. Their correctness is thus indefinite when monitoring the behavior of systems with imprecise clocks. We address this problem for a metric temporal logic: We identify classes of formulas for which we can leverage existing monitors to correctly reason about observed system traces.","authors":["David Basin","Felix Klaedtke","Srdjan Marinovic","Eugen Zalinescu"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-11164-3_16","Conference: International Conference on Runtime Verification"],"references":["289881173_Spanner","262249156_Runtime_Verification_of_Traces_Under_Recording_Uncertainty","222825550_Monitoring_Algorithms_for_Metric_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","220958490_Monitoring_Temporal_Properties_of_Continuous_Signals","220403727_Runtime_verification_for_LTL_and_TLTL","312851571_Monitoring_Temporal_Properties_of_Continuous_Signals","262389077_Algorithms_for_Monitoring_Real-Time_Properties","220414082_Specifying_Real-Time_Properties_with_Metric_Temporal_Logic"]}
