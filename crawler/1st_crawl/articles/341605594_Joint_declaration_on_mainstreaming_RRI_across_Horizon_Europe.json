{"id":"341605594_Joint_declaration_on_mainstreaming_RRI_across_Horizon_Europe","abstract":"Leading RRI researchers and practitioners, together with policymakers and stakeholder organisations, discussed the state-of-the-art and future perspectives for RRI at the ‘Pathways to Transformation’ conference in June 2019, an event which was extended beyond Brussels, for instance by ca. 330 original tweets and ca. 840 retweets from ca. 160 unique accounts. In the conference, many participants expressed their concern about an uncertain future for RRI in the EC. As a result, numerous large-scale EU-funded RRI projects signed a Joint Declaration, urging the European Commission to make RRI a key objective of the upcoming framework programme, Horizon Europe – a plea to both mainstream the approach across the programme and provide specific resources for strengthening the RRI knowledge base. As the Horizon Europe programme is being forged, it is timely to present the Declaration for a broader audience.","authors":["Alexander Gerber","Ellen Forsberg","Clare Shelley-Egan","Rosa Arias"],"meta":["May 2020","DOI:10.1080/23299460.2020.1764837","Projects: NUCLEUSHEIRRI (Higher Education Institutions and Responsible Research and Innovation)"],"references":[]}
