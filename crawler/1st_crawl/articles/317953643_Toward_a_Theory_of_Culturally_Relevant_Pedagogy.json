{"id":"317953643_Toward_a_Theory_of_Culturally_Relevant_Pedagogy","abstract":"In the midst of discussions about improving education, teacher education, equity, and diversity, little has been done to make pedagogy a central area of investigation. This article attempts to challenge notions about the intersection of culture and teaching that rely solely on microanalytic or macroanalytic perspectives. Rather, the article attempts to build on the work done in both of these areas and proposes a culturally relevant theory of education. By raising questions about the location of the researcher in pedagogical research, the article attempts to explicate the theoretical framework of the author in the nexus of collaborative and reflexive research. The pedagogical practices of eight exemplary teachers of African-American students serve as the investigative \"site.\" Their practices and reflections on those practices provide a way to define and recognize culturally relevant pedagogy.","authors":["Gloria Ladson-Billings"],"meta":["January 1995American Educational Research Journal 32:465-491","DOI:10.2307/1163320"],"references":[]}
