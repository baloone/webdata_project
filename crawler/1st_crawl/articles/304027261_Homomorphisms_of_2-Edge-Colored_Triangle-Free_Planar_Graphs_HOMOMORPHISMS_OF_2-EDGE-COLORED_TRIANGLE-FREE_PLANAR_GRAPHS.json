Using these properties, we obtain in particular that the 2-edge-colored chromatic number of the class of triangle-free planar graphs is at most 50. We also show that it is at least 12.","authors":["Pascal Ochem","Alexandre Pinlou","Sagnik Sen"],"meta":["June 2016Journal of Graph Theory 85(1)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.22059"],"references":["264625947_Homomorphisms_of_Signed_Graphs","226829480_Homomorphisms_of_Edge-Colored_Graphs_and_Coxeter_Groups","222662982_Oriented_vertex_and_arc_colorings_of_outerplanar_graphs","222469370_Good_and_semi-strong_colorings_of_oriented_planar_graphs","220081703_Homomorphisms_of_2-Edge-Colored_Graphs","47664932_Oriented_Coloring_of_Triangle-Free_Planar_Graphs_and_2-Outerplanar_Graphs","266271435_Lower_bounds_for_the_colored_mixed_chromatic_number_of_some_classes_of_graphs","266252215_Uber_Selbstkomplementare_Graphen","256157728_Acyclic_colorings_of_planar_graphs","222686061_Homomorphisms_of_sparse_graphs_with_large_girth","220193235_Edge-switching_homomorphisms_of_edge-coloured_graphs"]}
