{"id":"325179402_A_New_Method_for_Refining_the_Shafer's_Equality_and_Bounding_the_Definite_Integrals","abstract":"This paper presents an interpolation-based method for bounding some smooth functions, including the arctangent functions related to Shafer’s inequality. Given the form of new bounding functions, the interpolation technique is also utilized for determining the corresponding unknown coefficients, and the resulting functions bound the given function very well under some preset condition. Two applications are shown, one is to refine Shafer’s inequality, and the other is to approximate the definite integrals of some special functions; both of them have wide applications in computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. Experimental results show that the new bounds achieve much better bounds than those of prevailing methods.","authors":["Xiao-Diao Chen","Song Jin","Chen Li-Geng","Yigang Wang"],"meta":["May 2018Results in Mathematics 73(2):78","DOI:10.1007/s00025-018-0836-3"],"references":["280713435_On_certain_old_and_new_trigonometric_and_hyperbolic_inequalities","268046116_Estimates_for_the_arctangent_function_related_to_Shafer's_inequality","267632284_Chaotic_Firefly_Algorithm_for_Solving_Definite_Integral","264993961_On_Shafer_and_Carlson_Inequalities","324295338_Interpolation_and_Approximation","313690972_An_efficient_method_based_on_hybrid_functions_for_Fredholm_integral_equation_of_the_first_kind_with_convergence_analysis","309955336_A_user-friendly_method_for_computing_indefinite_integrals_of_oscillatory_functions","299383613_New_approximations_of_some_expressions_involving_trigonometric_functions","269000470_Interpolation_and_Approximation","263507912_Inequalities_on_generalized_trigonometric_and_hyperbolic_functions","259564466_Sharpening_and_generalizations_of_Shafer's_inequality_for_the_arc_sine_function","220483870_One_Method_for_Proving_Inequalities_by_Computer","257194486_Optimal_quadrature_formulas_with_positive_coefficients_in_L2m01_space","245422243_J-Integral_Estimates_for_StrainHardening_Materials_in_Ductile_Fracture_Problems","220162677_On_approximation_of_continuous_functions_by_trigonometric_polynomials"]}
