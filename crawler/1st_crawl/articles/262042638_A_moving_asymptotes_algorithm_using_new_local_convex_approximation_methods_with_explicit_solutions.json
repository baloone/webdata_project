{"id":"262042638_A_moving_asymptotes_algorithm_using_new_local_convex_approximation_methods_with_explicit_solutions","abstract":"In this paper we propose new local convex approximations for solving unconstrained\nnon-linear optimization problems, based on a moving asymptotes algorithm. This method provides\nthe second order information for the moving asymptotes location. As a consequence, at each step of\nthe iterative process, a strictly convex approximation sub-problem is generated and solved. All sub-\nproblems will have explicit global optima, which considerably reduce the computational cost of our\noptimization method and generate an iteration sequence. For this method, we prove the convergence\nof the optimization algorithm under basic assumptions. In addition, we present an industrial problem\nto illustrate a practical application and numerical test of our method.","authors":["Mostafa Bachar","Thierry Estebenet","Guessab Allal"],"meta":["January 2014Electronic transactions on numerical analysis ETNA 43"],"references":["250890119_A_spectral_updating_for_the_method_of_moving_asymptotes","301396573_Throughflow_Design_Using_an_Automatic_Optimisation_Strategy","291322806_CALCULATION_OF_THE_THROUGH_FLOW_IN_THE_ROTOR_OF_AXIAL_TURBOMACHINE","275375168_Streamline_Curvature_Computing_Procedures_for_Fluid-Flow_Problems","269859570_Throughflow_Calculations_for_Transonic_Axial_Flow_Turbines","269045320_Advances_in_dual_algorithms_and_convex_approximation_methods","266231329_The_Integrated_Approach_of_FEM-SLP_for_Solving_Problems_of_Optimal_Design","261823251_Practical_Methods_of_Optimization_by_R_Fletcher","258225226_Turbomachinery_Flow_Physics_and_Dynamic_Performance","245520515_Stability_convergence_and_accuracy_of_two-dimensional_streamline_curvature_methods_using_quasi-orthogonals"]}
