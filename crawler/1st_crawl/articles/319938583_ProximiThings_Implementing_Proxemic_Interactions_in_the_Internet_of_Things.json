{"id":"319938583_ProximiThings_Implementing_Proxemic_Interactions_in_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"Proxemic dimensions can help mediate interactions between entities (people, objects) in Internet of Things environments and constitute an important element in the construction of proactive, context-aware and human-centric systems. However, as evidenced by the literature, little attention has been paid to implementing proxemic interactions in IoT platforms. We present ProximiThings, a framework for facilitating the incorporation of proxemic capabilities in IoT-based systems. We describe the construction of various prototypes to show how ProximiThings can be used by developers in real settings.","authors":["Carlos Cardenas","J.
