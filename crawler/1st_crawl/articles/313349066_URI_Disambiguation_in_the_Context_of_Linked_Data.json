{"id":"313349066_URI_Disambiguation_in_the_Context_of_Linked_Data","abstract":"The Linked Data initiative has given rise to an increasing number of RDF datasets, many of which are freely accessible online. These resources often arise as a result of database exports; however sufficient consideration may not be given to the unseen implications caused when they are used in the wider context of the Semantic Web. This paper investigates two popular resources, DBLP and DBpedia, and discusses whether the issues regarding identity management and co-reference resolution have been suitably addressed. We find that a large percentage of authors in DBLP have been conflated, and that disambiguation pages have been incorrectly linked using owl:sameAs within DBpedia. Systems for dealing with these issues are presented, and directions are given for future research.","authors":["Afraz Jaffri","Hugh Glaser","Ian Millard"],"meta":["April 2008","Conference: Linked Data on the Web (LDOW2008)"],"references":[]}
