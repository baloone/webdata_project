{"id":"283653096_Multi-contrast_submillimetric_3Tesla_hippocampal_subfield_segmentation_protocol_and_dataset","abstract":"The hippocampus is composed of distinct anatomical subregions that participate in multiple cognitive processes and are differentially affected in prevalent neurological and psychiatric conditions. Advances in high-field MRI allow for the non-invasive identification of hippocampal substructure. These approaches, however, demand time-consuming manual segmentation that relies heavily on anatomical expertise. Here, we share manual labels and associated high-resolution MRI data (MNI-HISUB25; submillimetric T1-and T2-weighted images, detailed sequence information, and stereotaxic probabilistic anatomical maps) based on 25 healthy subjects. Data were acquired on a widely available 3 Tesla MRI system using a 32 phased-array head coil. The protocol divided the hippocampal formation into three subregions: subicular complex, merged Cornu Ammonis 1, 2 and 3 (CA1-3) subfields, and CA4-dentate gyrus (CA4-DG). Segmentation was guided by consistent intensity and morphology characteristics of the densely myelinated molecular layer together with few geometry-based boundaries flexible to overall mesiotemporal anatomy, and achieved excellent intra-/inter-rater reliability (Dice index ≥90/87%). The dataset can inform neuroimaging assessments of the mesiotemporal lobe and help to develop segmentation algorithms relevant for basic and clinical neurosciences.","authors":["Jessie Kulaga-Yoskovitz","Boris Bernhardt","Seok‐Jun Hong","Tommaso Mansi"],"meta":["November 2015Scientific Data 2(150059)","DOI:10.1038/sdata.2015.59"],"references":["346789679_The_Human_Hippocampus_Functional_Anatomy_Vascularization_and_Serial_Sections_with_MRI","292655442_The_human_hippocampus_Functional_anatomy_vascularization_and_serial_sections_with_MRI_fourth_edition","285289058_Studies_on_the_structure_of_the_cerebral_cortex_II_Continuation_of_the_study_of_the_ammonic_system","285034832_Studies_on_the_structure_of_the_cerebral_cortex_II_Continuation_of_the_study_of_the_Ammonic_system","284743633_Sitz_und_Wesen_der_Krankheiten_im_Lichte_der_topistischen_Hirnforschung_und_des_Variierens_der_Tiere","284688127_A_nonparametric_method_for_automatic_correction_of_intensity_nonuniformity_in_MRI_data_I","284091024_Histologie_du_Systeme_Nerveux_de_l'Homme_et_des_Vertebres","277542299_Bernasconi_N_Bernasconi_A_Caramanos_Z_Antel_SB_Andermann_F_Arnold_DL_Mesial_temporal_damage_in_temporal_lobe_epilepsy_a_volumetric_MRI_study_of_the_hippocampus_amygdala_and_parahippocampal_region_Brai","264433129_Delineation_of_Hippocampal_Subregions_Using_T1-weighted_Magnetic_Resonance_Images_at_3_Tesla","259336807_In_Vivo_Normative_Atlas_of_the_Hippocampal_Subfields_Using_Multi-Echo_Susceptibility_Imaging_at_7_Tesla"]}
