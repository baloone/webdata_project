{"id":"346492936_Data_and_information_in_online_environments","abstract":"Online social environments have opened up new opportunities for data and information analysis and processing. The high volume of content generated daily imposes a challenge regarding the design of indicators, procedures, and techniques for measuring these data. Behind the study of these topics, lie theories and models mainly coming from the information, communication, and computer sciences, three broad disciplinary contexts that converge in the effective design of Information and Communication Technologies and their relationship with people.","authors":["Carlos Luis González-Valiente","Douglas D.
