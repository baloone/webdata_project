{"id":"256477214_The_Google_Scholar_Experiment_How_to_Index_False_Papers_and_Manipulate_Bibliometric_Indicators","abstract":"Google Scholar has been well received by the research community. Its promises\nof free, universal and easy access to scientific literature as well as the\nperception that it covers better than other traditional multidisciplinary\ndatabases the areas of the Social Sciences and the Humanities have contributed\nto the quick expansion of Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics:\ntwo new bibliometric products that offer citation data at the individual level\nand at journal level. In this paper we show the results of a experiment\nundertaken to analyze Google Scholar's capacity to detect citation counting\nmanipulation. For this, six documents were uploaded to an institutional web\ndomain authored by a false researcher and referencing all the publications of\nthe members of the EC3 research group at the University of Granada. The\ndetection of Google Scholar of these papers outburst the citations included in\nthe Google Scholar Citations profiles of the authors. We discuss the effects of\nsuch outburst and how it could affect the future development of such products\nnot only at individual level but also at journal level, especially if Google\nScholar persists with its lack of transparency.","authors":["Emilio Delgado López-Cózar","Nicolás Robinson-Garcia","Daniel Torres-Salinas"],"meta":["March 2014Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 65(3)","DOI:10.1002/asi.23056","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269761539_Academic_search_engine_optimization_ASEO","268271559_Users_Narcissism_and_Control-Tracking_the_Impact_of_Scholarly_Publications_in_the_21_st_Century","262155343_Researchers_of_Tomorrow_The_research_behaviour_of_Generation_Y_doctoral_students","258818260_Ranking_journals_Could_Google_Scholar_Metrics_be_an_alternative_to_Journal_Citation_Reports_and_Scimago_Journal_Rank","250221943_Google_Scholar_as_a_New_Source_for_Citation_Analysis","248843855_Impact_of_Data_Sources_on_Citation_Counts_and_Rankings_of_LIS_Faculty_Web_of_Science_vs","236944259_Institutional_and_country_collaboration_in_an_online_service_of_scientific_profiles_Google_Scholar_Citations","236944216_Science_is_all_in_the_eye_of_the_beholder_Keyword_maps_in_Google_Scholar_Citations","236776746_Comparative_Recall_and_Precision_of_Simple_and_Expert_Searches_in_Google_Scholar_and_Eight_Other_Databases","235338654_Google_Scholar_Metrics_an_unreliable_tool_for_assessing_scientific_journals","233824275_Manipulating_Google_Scholar_Citations_and_Google_Scholar_Metrics_simple_easy_and_tempting","224059170_Academic_Search_Engine_Spam_and_Google_Scholar's_Resilience_Against_it","220435557_How_is_science_cited_on_the_Web_A_classification_of_Google_unique_Web_citations","220435252_Assessing_the_Citation_Impact_of_Books_The_Role_of_Google_Books_Google_Scholar_and_Scopus","220435171_Impact_of_data_sources_on_citation_counts_and_rankings_of_LIS_faculty_Web_of_Science_Scopus_and_Google_Scholar_Journal_of_American_Society_for_Information_Science_and_Technology_5813_2105-2125","220365050_Which_h-index-A_comparison_of_WoS_Scopus_and_Google_Scholar","220195597_Online_use_and_information_seeking_behaviour_Institutional_and_subject_comparisons_of_UK_researchers","200610396_Academic_Search_Engine_Optimization_ASEO_Optimizing_Scholarly_Literature_for_Google_Scholar_Co","51031304_Detecting","40228444_Google_Scholar_como_herramienta_para_la_evaluacion_cientifica","23250334_Playing_the_system_to_give_low-impact_journal_more_clout","309665178_The_four_literatures_of_social_science_patent_statistics_in_studies_of_ST_systems","289768744_Repositories_in_Google_Scholar_Metrics_or_what_is_this_document_type_doing_in_a_place_as_such","281955309_Ike_Antkare_one_of_the_great_stars_in_the_scientific_firmament","257056786_Google_Scholar_e_indice_h_en_biomedicina_la_popularizacion_de_la_evaluacion_bibliometrica","239580252_Peer-review_practices_of_psychological_journals_The_fate_of_published_articles_submitted_again","236124625_Google_Scholar_and_the_h-index_in_biomedicine_The_popularization_of_bibliometric_assessment","235305144_Google_Scholar_duped_and_deduped-The_aura_of_robometrics","231878497_Peer-review_practices_of_psychological_journals_The_fate_of_published_articles_submitted_again","226324606_Is_Google_Scholar_useful_for_bibliometrics_A_webometric_analysis","222824470_The_H-index_Advantages_limitations_and_its_relation_with_other_bibliometric_indicators_at_the_micro_level","200027340_A_Physicist_Experiments_With_Cultural_Studies","51932209_The_Inconsistency_of_the_h-index","51545089_Computing_giants_launch_free_science_metrics","51432083_The_Top-Ten_in_Journal_Impact_Factor_Manipulation","39995045_Researchers'_use_of_academic_libraries_and_their_services_A_report_commissioned_by_the_Research_Information_Network_and_the_Consortium_of_Research_Libraries","27398726_Institutional_repositories_in_the_UK_What_can_the_Google_user_find_there","2876095_The_Four_Literatures_Of_Social_Science"]}
