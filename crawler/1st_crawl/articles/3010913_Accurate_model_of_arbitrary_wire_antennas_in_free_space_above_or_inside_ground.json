{"id":"3010913_Accurate_model_of_arbitrary_wire_antennas_in_free_space_above_or_inside_ground","abstract":"An accurate model of wire antennas in free space, above or inside\nlossy ground is presented in which the current is assumed to flow on the\nsurface of the wire and the testing is also performed on the surface. To\nreplace the traditional delta-gap source, a more accurate source model\nis developed by using the Huygens' principle. From this principle and\nreciprocity theorem, a variational formulation of the input admittance\nis derived. When the triangle function is chosen as both basis and\nweighting functions, all the elements of impedance matrix and source\nvector are formulated in closed forms, which can be rapidly computed.\nSeveral numerical results are given. Comparing with measured data, both\nthe current distribution and input impedance by this model are more\naccurate than those of delta-gap model","authors":["Tie Jun Cui","Weng Cho Chew"],"meta":["May 2000IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation AP-48(4):482 - 493","DOI:10.1109/8.843661","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["245323280_Computer_Modelling_of_Antennas_Near_the_Ground","237217262_Analysis_of_Wire_Antenna_in_the_Presence_of_a_Conducting_Half_Space_Part_I_The_Vertical_Antenna_in_Free_Space","296893689_Modeling_of_arbitrary_wire_antennas_above_ground","292098522_Antenna_Theory_and_Design","285436191_Electrical_oscillations_in_wires","267003092_Theoretical_investigation_in_the_transmitting_and_receiving_qualities_of_antennae","258433128_Antenna_Theory_Analysis_and_Design","255930594_Fast_evaluation_of_Sommerfeld_integrals_for_EM_scattering_and_radiation_by_three-dimensional_buried_objects","252717109_a_Study_of_Circular_Arrays","252486839_The_horizontal_circular_loop_antenna_near_a_planar_interface","252432369_A_unified_theory_on_radiation_of_a_vertical_electric_dipole_above_a_dissipative_earth","241483527_Radiation_Problem_Book_Reviews_Dipole_Radiation_in_the_Presence_of_a_Conducting_Half-Space","237212135_Appraisal_of_near-field_solutions_for_a_Hertzian_dipole_over_a_conducting_half-space","233064794_Evaluation_of_Sommerfeld_integrals_for_lossy_half-space_problems","230607420_Dipole_Radiation_in_the_Presence_of_a_Conducting_Half-Space","229695988_Ber_die_Ausbreitung_der_Wellen_in_der_drahtlosen_Telegraphie","228077457_Waves_and_Fields_in_Inhomogenous_Media","210909012_Field_Computation_By_Moment_Method","3987349_NEC_-_Numerical_electromagnetics_code_for_antennas_and_scattering","3813794_Accurate_model_of_arbitrary_wire_antennas_in_free_space_above_or_inside_lossy_ground","3468888_The_Distribution_of_Current_along_a_Symmetrical_Center-Driven_Antenna","3444052_A_new_interpretation_of_the_integral_equation_formulation_of_cylindrical_antennas","3362085_Analysis_of_a_Probe-Fed_Microstrip_Disk_Antenna","3202295_Modeling_of_arbitrary_wire_antennas_above_ground","3202085_Fast_evaluation_of_Sommerfeld_integrals_for_EM_scattering_and_radiation_by_three-dimensional_buried_objects","3120298_Thin-stratified_medium_fast-multipole_algorithm_for_solving_microstrip_structures","3015024_Electromagnetic_Fields_of_Buried_Sources_in_Stratified_Anisotopic_Media","3014221_Analysis_of_Various_Numerical_Techniques_Applied_to_Thin-Wire_Scatterers","3012354_A_Wire_Grid_Model_For_Scattering_By_Conducting_Bodies","3010068_Multilayered_Media_Green's_Functions_in_Integral_Equation_Formulations"]}
