{"id":"279632907_Information_Extraction_from_Larger_Multi-layer_Social_Networks","abstract":"Social networks often encode community structure using multiple distinct\ntypes of links between nodes. In this paper we introduce a novel method to\nextract information from such multi-layer networks, where each type of link\nforms its own layer. Using the concept of Pareto optimality, community\ndetection in this multi-layer setting is formulated as a multiple criterion\noptimization problem. We propose an algorithm for finding an approximate Pareto\nfrontier containing a family of solutions. The power of this approach is\ndemonstrated on a Twitter dataset, where the nodes are hashtags and the layers\ncorrespond to (1) behavioral edges connecting pairs of hashtags whose temporal\nprofiles are similar and (2) relational edges connecting pairs of hashtags that\nappear in the same tweets.","authors":["Brandon Oselio","Alex Kulesza","Alfred Hero"],"meta":["June 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257142871_Multilayer_Networks","250618921_A_Multilevel_Network_Study_of_the_Eects_of_Delinquent_Behavior_on_Friendship_Evolution","249995417_Mathematical_Formulation_of_Multi-Layer_Networks","233873020_Alignment_and_integration_of_complex_networks_by_hypergraph-based_spectral_clustering","220605451_Multiobjective_Optimization","215683684_The_ML-Model_for_Multi-layer_Social_Networks","243766151_On_the_'Probable_Error'_of_a_Coefficient_of_Correlation_Deduced_From_a_Small_Sample","234801250_A_Tutorial_on_Spectral_Clustering","201976941_An_Efficient_Heuristic_Procedure_for_Partitioning_Graphs","46621083_A_multilevel_network_study_of_the_effects_of_delinquent_behaviour_on_friendship_evolution"]}
