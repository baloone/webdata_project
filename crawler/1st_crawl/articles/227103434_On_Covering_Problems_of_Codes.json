{"id":"227103434_On_Covering_Problems_of_Codes","abstract":"LetC be a binary code of lengthn (i.e., a subset of {0, 1}\nn\n). TheCovering Radius of C is the smallest integerr such that each vector in {0, 1}\nn\nis at a distance at mostr from some code word. Our main result is that the decision problem associated with the Covering Radius of arbitrary binary\ncodes is NP-complete.\n\nThis result is established as follows. TheRadius of a binary codeC is the smallest integerr such thatC is contained in a radius-r ball of the Hamming metric space 〈{0, 1}\nn\n,d〉. It is known [K] that the problems of computing the Radius and the Covering Radius are equivalent. We show that the 3SAT\nproblem is polynomially reducible to the Radius decision problem.\n\nA central tool in our reduction is a metrical characterization of the set ofdoubled vectors of length 2n: {v=(v\n1\nv\n2 …v\n2n\n) | ∀i:v\n2i\n=v\n2i−1}. We show that there is a setY ⊂ {0, 1}2n\nsuch that for everyv ε {0, 1}2n\n:v is doubled iffY is contained in the radius-n ball centered atv; moreover,Y can be constructed in time polynomial inn.","authors":["M.
