{"id":"340651254_Tomographic_image_analysis_of_reinforcement_distribution_in_composites_using_a_flexible_and_material's_specialist-friendly_computational_environment","abstract":"A computational environment - in the following called Problem Solving Environment (PSE) - dedicated to the analysis of tomographic images of composite materials is presented. The PSE current version is centered on reinforcement characterization and its main features are: (i) running on a desktop PC equipped with GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphical Processing Units); (ii) allowing a non-specialist in Computer Science to define visual programs that specify a sequence of processing steps; (iii) execution times compatible with an interactive use, due to the computational processing power of GPUs; (iv) the inclusion of visualization modules and the possibility of steering the computations through parameter changes.","authors":["Fernando Birra","Magda Encarnação","Adriano Lopes","Pedro D.
