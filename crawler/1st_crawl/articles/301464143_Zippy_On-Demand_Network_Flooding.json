{"id":"301464143_Zippy_On-Demand_Network_Flooding","abstract":"In this paper, we tackle the challenge of rapidly disseminating rare events through a multi-hop network, while achieving unprecedented energy-efficiency. Contrary to state-of-the-art approaches, we circumvent the undesirable trade-offs associated with low-power duty-cycled protocols and backscatter technologies, and demonstrate a paradigm shift in low-power protocol design. We present Zippy, an on-demand flooding technique that provides robust asynchronous network wake-up, fine-grained per-hop synchronization and efficient data dissemination by leveraging low-complexity transmitter and receiver hardware. We are the first to demonstrate the on-demand flooding of rare events through a multi-hop network with end-to-end latencies of tens of milliseconds, while dissipating less than 10 microwatts during periods of inactivity. We present a prototype implementation of our proposed approach using a wireless sensor platform constructed from commercially available components. We extensively evaluate Zippy's performance in a laboratory setting and in an indoor testbed.","authors":["Felix Sutton","Bernhard Buchli","Jan Beutel","Lothar Thiele"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1145/2809695.2809705","Conference: the 13th ACM Conference"],"references":["308829424_A_testbed_for_fine-grained_tracing_of_time_sensitive_behavior_in_wireless_sensor_networks","267179617_A_Novel_Wake-Up_Receiver_with_Addressing_Capability_for_Wireless_Sensor_Nodes","266660162_Turbocharging_ambient_backscatter_communication","265136648_On_the_Reception_of_Concurrent_Transmissions_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","262411741_Ambient_Backscatter_Wireless_Communication_Out_of_Thin_Air","262400734_FlockLab_a_testbed_for_distributed_synchronized_tracing_and_profiling_of_wireless_embedded_systems","269308542_Wake-up_receiver_operating_at_433_MHz","269045329_Ambient_backscatter","267221130_A_COMPARISON_BETWEEN_OOKASK_AND_FSK_MODULATION_TECHNIQUES_FOR_RADIO_LINKS","266661410_EkhoNet_High_speed_ultra_low-power_backscatter_for_next_generation_sensors"]}
