{"id":"327735361_Multi-dimensional_data_indexing_and_range_query_processing_via_Voronoi_diagram_for_internet_of_things","abstract":"In a typical Internet of Things (IoT) deployment such as smart cities and Industry 4.0, the amount of sensory data collected from physical world is significant and wide-ranging. Processing large amount of real-time data from the diverse IoT devices is challenging. For example, in IoT environment, wireless sensor networks (WSN) are typically used for the monitoring and collecting of data in some geographic area. Spatial range queries with location constraints to facilitate data indexing are traditionally employed in such applications, which allows the querying and managing the data based on SQL structure. One particular challenge is to minimize communication cost and storage requirements in multi-dimensional data indexing approaches. In this paper, we present an energy- and time-efficient multidimensional data indexing scheme, which is designed to answer range query. Specifically, we propose data indexing methods which utilize hierarchical indexing structures, using binary space partitioning (BSP), such as kd-tree, quad-tree, k-means clustering, and Voronoi-based methods to provide more efficient routing with less latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the Voronoi Diagram-based algorithm minimizes the average energy consumption and query response time.","authors":["Shaohua Wan","Yu Zhao","Tian Wang","Zonghua Gu"],"meta":["September 2018Future Generation Computer Systems 91(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2018.08.007"],"references":["321799334_Performance_Analysis_of_Cluster_Formation_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","319476441_A_Survey_on_Data_Quality_for_Dependable_Monitoring_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","318476329_Nearly_Optimal_Bounds_for_Orthogonal_Least_Squares","318120563_Fuzzy-Logic_Based_Distributed_Energy-Efficient_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","310491792_Reverse_k_nearest_neighbors_queries_and_spatial_reverse_top-k_queries","307935419_Fuzzy_C-Means_Clustering_and_Energy_Efficient_Cluster_Head_Selection_for_Cooperative_Sensor_Network","306330602_Energy_Big_Data_A_Survey","304366898_HHT-Based_Security_Enhancement_Approach_with_Low_Overhead_for_Coding-Based_Reprogramming_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","304083299_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Optimally_Solving_a_Shortest_Vector_Problem_in_Compute-and-Forward_Design","303719014_Data-Driven_Design_of_Intelligent_Wireless_Networks_An_Overview_and_Tutorial","301837240_Incremental_Voronoi_Diagrams","287338199_Energy-Efficient_Adaptive_Routing_and_Context-Aware_Lifetime_Maximization_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","274495859_Maximizing_the_Lifetime_of_Query-Based_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221298760_Optimal_Sampling_Rate_Assignment_with_Dynamic_Route_Selection_for_Real-Time_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220416570_QUASAR_Quality_aware_sensing_architecture","323785450_SPHA_Smart_Personal_Health_Advisor_Based_on_Deep_Analytics","320694161_Coverage_Hole_Bypassing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","318434710_A_Scalable_and_Quick-Response_Software_Defined_Vehicular_Network_Assisted_by_Mobile_Edge_Computing","317146702_A_Survey_on_Energy_Internet_Communications_for_Sustainability","313467052_Spoofing-Jamming_Attack_Strategy_Using_Optimal_Power_Distributions_in_Wireless_Smart_Grid_Networks","313465021_An_Energy-Aware_Spatial_Index_Tree_for_Multi-Region_Attribute_Query_Aggregation_Processing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","308851923_Low-Power_Sensor_Polling_for_Context-Aware_Services_on_Smartphones","304714993_Efficient_implementation_to_numerically_solve_the_nonlinear_time_fractional_parabolic_problems_on_unbounded_spatial_domain","304006576_On_the_Construction_of_Data_Aggregation_Tree_With_Maximizing_Lifetime_in_Large-Scale_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","280243620_Defending_jamming_attack_in_wide-area_monitoring_system_for_smart_grid","276244912_Network-Matched_Trajectory-Based_Moving-Object_Database_Models_and_Applications","276173085_Periodic_Query_Optimization_Leveraging_Popularity-Based_Caching_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Industrial_IoT_Applications","273170465_Insights_of_Top-_Query_in_Duty-Cycled_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","272040159_Energy-efficient_top-k_query_evaluation_and_maintenance_in_wireless_sensor_networks","266677446_A_note_on_compact_finite_difference_method_for_reaction-diffusion_equations_with_delay","262453341_A_taxonomy_for_moving_object_queries_in_spatial_databases","259162211_Spatial_query_processing_in_wireless_sensor_networks_-_A_survey","257251989_Online_Optimization_for_Scheduling_Preemptable_tasks_on_IaaS_Cloud_systems","224097533_Adaptive_Fault-Tolerant_QoS_Control_Algorithms_for_Maximizing_System_Lifetime_of_Query-Based_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220419215_HRS_A_Hierarchical_Routing_and_Scheduling_Scheme_for_Distributed_Real-Time_and_Embedded_Systems","215619042_TinyDB_An_Acquisitional_Query_Processing_System_for_Sensor_Networks"]}
