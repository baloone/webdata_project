{"id":"228550955_Strategies_for_Building_Blended_Learning","abstract":"At a recent conference, a practitioner was overheard saying, \"I can see why blending makes sense. But what do I put with what? We have a hundred instructors and e-learning modules. If I put them together, is that a blend? What is a blend and how do I make it work in an organization that prefers a quick fix?\" Those questions and more are tackled here. A blend is an integrated strategy for delivering on promises about learning and performance. Blending involves a planned combination of approaches, such as coaching by a supervisor; participation in an online class; breakfast with colleagues; competency descriptions; reading on the beach; reference to a manual; collegial relationships; and participation in seminars, workshops, and online communities. A study by Peter Dean and his colleagues found that providing several linked options for learners, in addition to classroom training, increased what they learned. In 2002, Harvard Business School faculty DeLacey and Leonard reported that students not only learned more when online sessions were added to traditional courses, but student interaction and satisfaction improved as well. Thomson and NETg released a 2003 white paper that reported speedier performance on real world tasks by people who learned through a blended strategyâ€”faster than those studying through e-learning alone.","authors":["Allison Rossett","Felicia Douglis","Rebecca Frazee"],"meta":["January 2003"],"references":[]}
