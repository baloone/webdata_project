{"id":"340838161_Towards_Higher_Performance_and_Robust_Compilation_for_CGRA_Modulo_Scheduling","abstract":"Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRA) is a promising solution for accelerating computation intensive tasks due to its good trade-off in energy efficiency and flexibility. One of the challenging research topic is how to effectively deploy loops onto CGRAs within acceptable compilation time. Modulo scheduling (MS) has shown to be efficient on deploying loops onto CGRAs. Existing CGRA MS algorithms still suffer from mapping loop with higher performance under acceptable compilation time, especially mapping large and irregular loops onto CGRAs with limited computational and routing resources. This is mainly due to the under utilization of the available buffer resources on CGRA, unawareness of critical mapping constraints and time consuming method of solving temporal and spatial mapping. This paper focus on improving the performance and compilation robustness of the modulo scheduling mapping algorithm for CGRAs. We decomposes the CGRA MS problem into the temporal and spatial mapping problem and reorganize the processes inside these two problems. For the temporal mapping problem, we provide a comprehensive and systematic mapping flow that includes a powerful buffer allocation algorithm, and efficient interconnection & computational constraints solving algorithms. For the spatial mapping problem, we develop a fast and stable spatial mapping algorithm with backtracking and reordering mechanism. Our MS mapping algorithm is able to map loops onto CGRA with higher performance and faster compilation time. Experiment results show that given the same compilation time budget, our mapping algorithm generates higher compilation success rate. Among the successfully compiled loops, our approach can improve 5.4% to 14.2% performance and takes x24 to x1099 less compilation time in average comparing with state-of-the-art CGRA mapping algorithms.","authors":["Zhongyuan Zhao","Weiguang Sheng","Qin Wang","Wenzhi Yin"],"meta":["April 2020IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems
