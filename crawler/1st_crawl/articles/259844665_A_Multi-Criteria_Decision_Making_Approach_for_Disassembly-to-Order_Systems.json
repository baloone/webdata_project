{"id":"259844665_A_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_Approach_for_Disassembly-to-Order_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, we present a multi-criteria optimization model of a disassembly-to-order system to determine the best combination of the number of each product type to be taken back at the end-of-life and disassembled to meet the demand for items and materials retrieved from them under a variety of physical, financial and environmental constrains so as to achieve the preemptive goals of maximum total profit, maximum sales from materials, minimum number of disposed items, minimum number of stored items, minimum cost of disposal and minimum cost of preparation, in that order. When solved, the model provides the number of reused, recycled, stored and disposed items as well as the values of a host of other performance measures. A case example is presented to illustrate the model's implementation.","authors":["Elif Kongar","Surendra Gupta"],"meta":["June 2002Journal of Electronics Manufacturing 11(2):171-183","DOI:10.1142/S0960313102000345"],"references":["259844685_Multi-Objective_Optimization_of_Lot_Size_Balancing_for_Multi_Products_Selective_Disassembly","303837875_Optimal_estimation_of_executive_compensation_by_linear_programming","292664141_Disassembly_Scheduling_with_Parts_Commonality_Using_Petri_Nets_with_Timestamps","292219083_Optimal_analysis_of_lot-size_balancing_for_multiproducts_selective_disassembly","280809118_Disassembly_of_products","274189164_Analysis_of_design_efficiency_for_the_disassembly_of_modular_electronic_products","268671487_Linear_Programming_in_Single-_Multiple-Objective_Systems","266068924_Goal_Programming_Methodology_and_Applications","257178053_Linear_programming_in_disassemblyclustering_sequence_generation","250718333_An_evaluation_methodology_for_disassembly_processes"]}
