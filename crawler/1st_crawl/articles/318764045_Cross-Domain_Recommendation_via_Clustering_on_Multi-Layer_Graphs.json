{"id":"318764045_Cross-Domain_Recommendation_via_Clustering_on_Multi-Layer_Graphs","abstract":"Venue category recommendation is an essential application for the tourism and advertisement industries, wherein it may suggest attractive localities within close proximity to users' current location. Considering that many adults use more than three social networks simultaneously, it is reasonable to leverage on this rapidly growing multi-source social media data to boost venue recommendation performance. Another approach to achieve higher recommendation results is to utilize group knowledge, which is able to diversify recommendation output. Taking into account these two aspects, we introduce a novel cross-network collaborative recommendation framework CÂ³R, which utilizes both individual and group knowledge, while being trained on data from multiple social media sources. Group knowledge is derived based on new cross-source user community detection approach, which utilizes both inter-source relationship and the ability of sources to complement each other. To fully utilize multi-source multi-view data, we process user-generated content by employing state-of-the-art text, image, and location processing techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multi-source framework over state-of-the-art baselines and different data source combinations. In addition, we suggest a new approach for automatic construction of inter-network relationship graph based on the data, which eliminates the necessity of having pre-defined domain knowledge.","authors":["Aleksnadr Farseev","Ivan Samborskii","Andrey Filchenkov","Tat-Seng Chua"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1145/3077136.3080774","Conference: the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference","Projects: Mobility360 Degree Multi-Source User Profile Learning"],"references":["319280866_Tweet_Can_Be_Fit_Integrating_Data_from_Wearable_Sensors_and_Multiple_Social_Networks_for_Wellness_Profile_Learning","317558508_Item_Silk_Road_Recommending_Items_from_Information_Domains_to_Social_Users","316940533_Learning_User_Attributes_via_Mobile_Social_Multimedia_Analytics","316009741_Unifying_Virtual_and_Physical_Worlds_Learning_Toward_Local_and_Global_Consistency","315809625_Towards_User_Personality_Profiling_from_Multiple_Social_Networks","310819992_bBridge_A_Big_Data_Platform_for_Social_Multimedia_Analytics","318764160_Attentive_Collaborative_Filtering_Multimedia_Recommendation_with_Item-_and_Component-Level_Attention","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","312228574_Cross-domain_collaborative_learning_in_social_multimedia","310827728_Cross-Domain_Collaborative_Learning_in_Social_Multimedia"]}
