{"id":"267157456_A_Multilevel_Bilinear_Programming_Algorithm_For_the_Vertex_Separator_Problem","abstract":"The Vertex Separator Problem for a graph is to find the smallest collection\nof vertices whose removal breaks the graph into two disconnected subsets that\nsatisfy specified size constraints. In the paper 10.1016/j.ejor.2014.05.042,\nthe Vertex Separator Problem was formulated as a continuous\n(non-concave/non-convex) bilinear quadratic program. In this paper, we develop\na more general continuous bilinear program which incorporates vertex weights,\nand which applies to the coarse graphs that are generated in a multilevel\ncompression of the original Vertex Separator Problem. A Mountain Climbing\nAlgorithm is used to find a stationary point of the continuous bilinear\nquadratic program, while second-order optimality conditions and perturbation\ntechniques are used to escape from either a stationary point or a local\nmaximizer. The algorithms for solving the continuous bilinear program are\nemployed during the solution and refinement phases in a multilevel scheme.\nComputational results and comparisons demonstrate the advantage of the proposed\nalgorithm.","authors":["William W.
