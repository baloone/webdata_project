{"id":"299417679_Brucella_vulpis_sp_Nov_isolated_from_mandibular_lymph_nodes_of_red_foxes_vulpes_vulpes","abstract":"Two slow-growing, Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, coccoid bacteria (strains F60T and F965), isolated in Austria from mandibular lymph nodes of two red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), were subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. In a recent study, both isolates were assigned to the genus Brucella but could not be attributed to any of the existing species. Hence, we have analysed both strains in further detail to determine their exact taxonomic position and genetic relatedness to other members of the genus Brucella. The genome sizes of F60T and F965 were 3 236 779 and 3 237 765 bp, respectively. Each genome consisted of two chromosomes, with a DNA G+C content of 57.2%. A genome-to-genome distance of >80 %, an average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 97% and an average amino acid identity (AAI) of 98% compared with the type species Brucella melitensis confirmed affiliation to the genus. Remarkably, 5% of the entire genetic information of both strains was of non-Brucella origin, including as-yet uncharacterized bacteriophages and insertion sequences as well as ABCtransporters and other genes of metabolic function from various soil-living bacteria. Core-genome-based phylogenetic reconstructions placed the novel species well separated from all hitherto-described species of the genus Brucella, forming a long-branched sister clade to the classical species of Brucella. In summary, based on phenotypic and molecular data, we conclude that strains F60T and F965 are members of a novel species of the genus Brucella, forwhich the name Brucella vulpis sp. nov. is proposed,with the type strain F60T (=BCCN 09-2T=DSM 101715T).","authors":["Scholz HC","Sandra Revilla-Fern√°ndez","Sascha Al Dahouk","Jens Andre Hammerl"],"meta":["February 2016International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 66(5)","DOI:10.1099/ijsem.0.000998"],"references":["272414653_Isolation_of_Brucella_from_a_White's_tree_frog_Litoria_caerulea","265965371_Brucella_papii_sp_nov_isolated_from_baboons_Papio_spp","221693666_Isolation_of_Potentially_Novel_Brucella_spp_from_Frogs","47532609_Differential_phenotyping_of_Brucella_species_using_a_newly_developed_semi-automated_metabolic_system","45271729_Characterization_of_Novel_Brucella_Strains_Originating_from_Wild_Native_Rodent_Species_in_North_Queensland_Australia","26723533_Brucella_inopinata_sp_nov_isolated_from_a_breast_implant_infection","24441484_EDGAR_A_software_framework_for_the_comparative_analysis_of_prokaryotic_genomes","24257660_Analysis_of_Ten_Brucella_Genomes_Reveals_Evidence_for_Horizontal_Gene_Transfer_Despite_a_Preferred_Intracellular_Lifestyle","23441045_Isolation_of_Brucella_microti_from_Mandibular_Lymph_Nodes_of_Red_Foxes_Vulpes_vulpes_in_Lower_Austria","23149725_Isolation_of_Brucella_microti_from_Soil","5868563_Novel_Brucella_Strain_BO1_Associated_with_a_Prosthetic_Breast_Implant_Infection","5826093_Brucellosis_of_the_Common_Vole","5632694_Brucella_microti_sp_nov_isolated_from_the_common_vole_Microtus_arvalis","292814129_Brucella_inopinata_species_Nov_isolated_from_a_breast_implant_infection","248382612_Molecular_characterisation_of_Brucella_species","247609845_International_Committee_on_Systematics_of_Prokaryotes_Subcommittee_on_the_taxonomy_of_Brucella_Minutes_of_the_meeting_17_September_2003_Pamplona_Spain","237603382_Proposal_for_Minimal_Standards_for_Descriptions_of_New_Species_and_Biotypes_of_the_Genus_Brucella","232526095_Abscesses_associated_with_a_Brucella_inopinata-like_bacterium_in_a_big-eyed_tree_frog_Leptopelis_vermiculatus","200037138_Molecular_Cloning_A_Laboratory_Manual_3-Volume_Set","51639567_A_potential_novel_Brucella_species_isolated_from_mandibular_lymph_nodes_of_red_foxes_in_Austria","22342165_Laboratory_Techniques_In_Brucellosis","19554807_Brucella_phages_Advances_in_the_development_of_a_reliable_phage_typing_system_for_growth_and_non-smooth_Brucella_isolates","8667716_MUSCLE_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_with_High_Accuracy_and_High_Throughput"]}
