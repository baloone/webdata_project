{"id":"326639838_HemoKinect_A_Microsoft_Kinect_V2_Based_Exergaming_Software_to_Supervise_Physical_Exercise_of_Patients_with_Hemophilia","abstract":"Patients with hemophilia need to strictly follow exercise routines to minimize their risk of suffering bleeding in joints, known as hemarthrosis. This paper introduces and validates a new exergaming software tool called HemoKinect that intends to keep track of exercises using Microsoft Kinect V2’s body tracking capabilities. The software has been developed in C++ and MATLAB. The Kinect SDK V2.0 libraries have been used to obtain 3D joint positions from the Kinect color and depth sensors. Performing angle calculations and center-of-mass (COM) estimations using these joint positions, HemoKinect can evaluate the following exercises: elbow flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension (squat), step climb (ankle exercise) and multi-directional balance based on COM. The software generates reports and progress graphs and is able to directly send the results to the physician via email. Exercises have been validated with 10 controls and eight patients. HemoKinect successfully registered elbow and knee exercises, while displaying real-time joint angle measurements. Additionally, steps were successfully counted in up to 78% of the cases. Regarding balance, differences were found in the scores according to the difficulty level and direction. HemoKinect supposes a significant leap forward in terms of exergaming applicability to rehabilitation of patients with hemophilia, allowing remote supervision.","authors":["Fernando Mateo","Emilio Soria Olivas","Juan José Carrasco","Santiago Bonanad"],"meta":["July 2018Sensors 18(8):2439","DOI:10.3390/s18082439"],"references":["322543357_An_instrumental_approach_for_monitoring_physical_exercises_in_a_visual_markerless_scenario_A_proof_of_concept","317351941_The_cost_of_severe_haemophilia_in_Europe_the_CHESS_study","313894885_Experimental_Validation_of_Depth_Cameras_for_the_Parameterization_of_Functional_Balance_of_Patients_in_Clinical_Tests","310492157_Accuracy_and_Reliability_of_the_Kinect_Version_2_for_Clinical_Measurement_of_Motor_Function","308615218_Comparison_of_Kinect_V1_and_V2_Depth_Images_in_Terms_of_Accuracy_and_Precision","304813920_Concurrent_validity_of_the_Microsoft_Kinect_for_Windows_v2_for_measuring_spatiotemporal_gait_parameters","286624514_Performance_evaluation_of_the_1st_and_2nd_generation_Kinect_for_multimedia_applications","283327955_Evaluation_of_Pose_Tracking_Accuracy_in_the_First_and_Second_Generations_of_Microsoft_Kinect","316321407_Differential_effects_of_bleeds_on_the_development_of_arthropathy_-_basic_and_applied_issues","311496584_Balance_evaluation_in_haemophilic_preadolescent_patients_using_Nintendo_Wii_Balance_Board_R"]}
