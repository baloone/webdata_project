{"id":"266316565_Making_programming_languages_to_dance_to_Live_Coding_with_Tidal","abstract":"Live coding of music has grown into a vibrant international community of research and practice over the past decade, providing a new research domain where computer science blends with the performing arts. In this paper the domain of live coding is described, with focus on the programming language design challenges involved, and the ways in which a functional approach can meet those challenges. This leads to the introduction of Tidal 0.4, a Domain Specific Language embedded in Haskell. This is a substantial restructuring of Tidal, which now represents musical pattern as functions from time to events, inspired by Functional Reactive Programming.","authors":["Alex Mclean"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1145/2633638.2633647","Conference: proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design"],"references":["318494477_Rationalizing_Musical_Time_Syntactic_and_Symbolic-Numeric_Approaches","266316606_Manipulations_of_Musical_Patterns","266316584_Tracking_Virtuosity_and_Flow_in_Computer_Music","266015452_The_IXI_Lang_A_SuperCollider_Parasite_for_Live_Coding","228964847_A_principled_approach_to_developing_new_languages_for_live_coding","228811209_Live_coding_in_laptop_performance","228575469_Visualisation_of_Live_Code","221665298_Live-Musikprogrammierung_in_Haskell","221562986_Push-pull_functional_reactive_programming","41555450_Impromptu_An_interactive_programming_environment_for_composition_and_performance","266316566_Collaboration_and_learning_through_live_coding_Dagstuhl_Seminar_13382","266316469_Algorave_A_survey_of_the_history_aesthetics_and_technology_of_live_performance_of_algorithmic_electronic_dance_music","266316467_Extending_Instruments_with_Live_Algorithms_in_a_Percussion_Code_Duo","266316405_Special_issue_on_Live_Coding_Editor's_notes","266316403_An_Interface_for_Realtime_Music_Using_Interpreted_Haskell","264591557_Hacking_Choreography_Dance_and_Live_Coding","263128932_Live_Coding_in_a_Scalable_Participatory_Laptop_Orchestra","261135146_Live_Notation_Acoustic_Resonance","261134964_Tidal_-_Pattern_Language_for_the_Live_Coding_of_Music","239798557_Reflecting_on_the_Development_of_Interpretative_Phenomenological_Analysis_and_Its_Contribution_to_Qualitative_Research_in_Psychology","237991022_Rethinking_the_Computer_Music_Language_SuperCollider","42796823_Time_in_Indian_Music_Rhythm_Metre_and_Form_in_North_Indian_Rag_Performance","2452675_Instructions_and_Descriptions_some_cognitive_aspects_of_programming_and_similar_activities"]}
