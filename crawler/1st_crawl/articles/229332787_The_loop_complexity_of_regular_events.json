{"id":"229332787_The_loop_complexity_of_regular_events","abstract":"L. C. Eggan defined the “star height” of a regular expression in 1963. The present paper continues Eggan's investigation by showing how to reduce certain regular expressions to regular expressions representing the same set but with smaller star height, and also by showing that certain other regular expressions cannot be so reduced.","authors":["Robert Mcnaughton"],"meta":["July 1969Information Sciences 1(3):305-328","DOI:10.1016/S0020-0255(69)80016-2"],"references":["331470741_Techniques_for_Manipulating_Regular_Expressions_Proceedings_of_a_Conference_held_at_the_University_of_Western_Ontario_September_10-11_1965","307962645_Representation_of_Events_in_Nerve_Nets_and_Finite_Automata","287177784_Techniques_for_manipulating_regular_expressions","279684464_Cycle_rank_of_transition_graphs_and_the_star_height_of_regular_events","230875835_On_Formal_Properties_of_Simple_Phrase_Structure_Grammars","229124270_Representation_of_Events_in_Nerve_Nets_and_Finite_Automata","224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","224107205_On_the_star_height_of_regular_events","222446091_On_finite_monoids_having_only_trivial_subgroups","222374504_The_loop_complexity_of_pure-group_events","222365967_Finite_state_languages","220248796_On_a_Question_of_Eggan","38322945_Transition_graphs_and_the_star-height_of_regular_events"]}
