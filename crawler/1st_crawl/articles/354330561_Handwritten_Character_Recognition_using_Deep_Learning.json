{"id":"354330561_Handwritten_Character_Recognition_using_Deep_Learning","abstract":"In day to day human life, handwritten documents are a general purpose for communication and restoring their information. In the field of computer science, character recognition using Deep Learning has more attention. DL has a massive set of pattern recognition tools that can apply to speech recognition, image processing, natural language processing and has a remarkable capability to find out a solution for complex machine learning problems. DL can focus on the specific feature of an image to character recognition for enhancing efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we have presented a methods for handwritten character recognition using deep learning.","authors":["Bhargav Rajyagor","Rajnish Rakholia"],"meta":["March 2020International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering 8(6):5815-5819","DOI:10.35940/ijrte.F8608.038620"],"references":["333801032_Benchmarking_on_offline_Handwritten_Tamil_Character_Recognition_using_convolutional_neural_networks","332114646_Handwritten_Hindi_Character_Recognition_using_Deep_Learning_Techniques","331558015_Improved_word-level_handwritten_Indic_script_identification_by_integrating_small_convolutional_neural_networks","325657564_A_Lightning_fast_approach_to_classify_Bangla_Handwritten_Characters_and_Numerals_using_newly_structured_Deep_Neural_Network","337158636_Recognizing_Ancient_Characters_from_Tamil_Palm_Leaf_Manuscripts_using_Convolution_Based_Deep_Learning","334004118_A_Meetei_Mayek_Basic_Characters_Recognizer_Using_Deep_Features","329039681_A_New_Perspective_Recognizing_Online_Handwritten_Chinese_Characters_via_1-Dimensional_CNN","328910908_Deep_Learning_Based_Gujarati_Handwritten_Character_Recognition","327722960_Handwritten_Bangla_Character_Recognition_using_Inception_Convolutional_Neural_Network","326009476_Optical_Character_Recognition_using_Deep_learning_-_A_Technical_Review"]}
