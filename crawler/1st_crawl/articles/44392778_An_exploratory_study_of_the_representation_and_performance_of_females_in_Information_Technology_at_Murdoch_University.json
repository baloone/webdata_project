{"id":"44392778_An_exploratory_study_of_the_representation_and_performance_of_females_in_Information_Technology_at_Murdoch_University","abstract":"This paper presents some preliminary statistics about male and female entry, persistence and success rates in Information Technology courses at Murdoch University. The figures show that, like other countries, females make up only a small percentage of the overall student body in these courses. Further, they show that females have the same persistence and success rates as males, and that in some cases females perform better than males. Finally, the paper discusses further research that could be considered in this area.","authors":["S. Downes","V.J.
