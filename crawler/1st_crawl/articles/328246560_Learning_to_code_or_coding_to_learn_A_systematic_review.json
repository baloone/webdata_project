{"id":"328246560_Learning_to_code_or_coding_to_learn_A_systematic_review","abstract":"The resurgence of computer programming in the school curriculum brings a promise of preparing students for the future that goes beyond just learning how to code. This study reviewed research to analyse educational outcomes for children learning to code at school. A systematic review was applied to identify relevant articles and a thematic analysis to synthesise the findings. Ten articles were included in the synthesis and an overarching model was developed which depicts the themes. The results demonstrate that although students are learning to code, a range of other educational outcomes can be learnt or practiced through the teaching of coding. These included mathematical problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, self-management and academic skills. The review also identified the importance of instructional design for developing these educational outcomes through coding.","authors":["Shahira Popat","Louise Starkey"],"meta":["October 2018Computers & Education 128","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2018.10.005"],"references":["317696965_New_Paper_The_Effects_of_Computer_Programming_on_high_school_students'_reasoning_skills_and_self-efficacy_and_problem_solving_in_Mathematics","306362494_An_analysis_of_young_students'_thinking_when_completing_basic_coding_tasks_using_Scratch_Jnr_On_the_iPad_General_thinking_and_computational_work","304627526_Code_to_Learn_Where_Does_It_Belong_in_the_K-12_Curriculum","301716623_Computer_science_in_K-12_school_curricula_of_the_2lst_century_Why_what_and_when","293098210_Leveraging_Scratch4SL_and_Second_Life_to_motivate_high_school_students'_participation_in_introductory_programming_courses_Findings_from_a_case_study","274309848_Computational_Thinking","271746747_The_Effects_of_Teaching_Programming_via_Scratch_on_Problem_Solving_Skills_A_Discussion_from_Learners'_Perspective","270821026_Presenting_practical_application_of_Mathematics_by_the_use_of_programming_software_with_easily_available_visual_components","264274753_Educational_Research_Quantitative_Qualitative_and_Mixed_Approaches_Fifth_Edition","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","256005803_Computer_Programming_Goes_Back_to_School","234130454_Preparing_pre-service_teachers_to_integrate_technology_in_education_A_synthesis_of_qualitative_evidence","230751877_Bloom's_taxonomy_for_CS_assessment","23156527_Critically_Appraising_Qualitative_Research","317789613_Scratching_Beyond_the_Surface_of_Literacy_Programming_for_Early_Adolescent_Gifted_Students","301406168_Forward_50_Teaching_Coding_to_Ages_4-12_Programming_in_the_Elementary_School","301218336_Comparing_the_effects_of_derived_relational_training_and_computer_coding_on_intellectual_potential_in_school-age_children","297719113_Visual_programming_languages_integrated_across_the_curriculum_in_elementary_school_A_two_year_case_study_using_Scratch_in_five_schools","288069090_Transfer_Effects_of_a_High_School_Computer_Programming_Course_on_Mathematical_Modeling_Procedural_Comprehension_and_Verbal_Problem_Solution","288068931_The_Effect_of_BASIC_Programming_Language_Instruction_on_High_School_Students'_Problem_Solving_Ability_and_Computer_Anxiety","278672713_A_new_way_of_teaching_programming_skills_to_K-12_students_Codeorg","266562898_Review_on_teaching_and_learning_of_computational_thinking_through_programming_What_is_next_for_K-12","257171388_Problem_solving_by_5-6_years_old_kindergarten_children_in_a_computer_programming_environment_A_case_study","234656629_On_the_Cognitive_Effects_of_Learning_Computer_Programming_A_Critical_Look_Technical_Report_No_9","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","221517290_Growing_up_programming_democratizing_the_creation_of_dynamic_interactive_media","220095375_Programming-languages_as_a_conceptual_framework_for_teaching_mathematics","44828922_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_a_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives","30874241_Turtles_Termites_and_Traffic_Jams_Explorations_in_Massively_Parallel_Microworlds"]}
