{"id":"346504343_Deep_learning-based_model_for_detecting_2019_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_on_high-resolution_computed_tomography","abstract":"Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging method for diagnosing 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19) pneumonia. We aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT. For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively collected. Twenty-seven prospective consecutive patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected to evaluate the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model. An external test was conducted in Qianjiang Central Hospital to estimate the systemâ€™s robustness. The model achieved a per-patient accuracy of 95.24% and a per-image accuracy of 98.85% in internal retrospective dataset. For 27 internal prospective patients, the system achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. In external dataset, it achieved an accuracy of 96%. With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%. The deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist, and greatly improved the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice.","authors":["Jun Chen","Lianlian Wu","Jun Zhang","Liang Zhang"],"meta":["November 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-76282-0"],"references":["339493535_Risk_Assessment_of_Novel_Coronavirus_COVID-19_Outbreaks_Outside_China","339116866_Estimation_of_the_Transmission_Risk_of_the_2019-nCoV_and_Its_Implication_for_Public_Health_Interventions","339062088_Risk_assessment_of_novel_coronavirus_2019-nCoV_outbreaks_outside_China","339053508_Diagnosis_and_treatment_recommendations_for_pediatric_respiratory_infection_caused_by_the_2019_novel_coronavirus","338949183_Transmission_of_2019-nCoV_Infection_from_an_Asymptomatic_Contact_in_Germany","338932518_Pattern_of_early_human-to-human_transmission_of_Wuhan_2019_novel_coronavirus_2019-nCoV_December_2019_to_January_2020","338857202_Estimation_of_the_Transmission_Risk_of_the_2019-nCov_and_Its_Implication_for_Public_Health_Interventions","338806634_Clinical_features_of_patients_infected_with_2019_novel_coronavirus_in_Wuhan_China","338959825_First_Case_of_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_in_the_United_States","338931536_Epidemiological_and_clinical_characteristics_of_99_cases_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_in_Wuhan_China_a_descriptive_study"]}
