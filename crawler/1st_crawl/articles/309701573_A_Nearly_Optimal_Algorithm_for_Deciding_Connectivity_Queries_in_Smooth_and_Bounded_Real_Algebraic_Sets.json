{"id":"309701573_A_Nearly_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Deciding_Connectivity_Queries_in_Smooth_and_Bounded_Real_Algebraic_Sets","abstract":"A roadmap for a semi-algebraic set S is a curve which has a non-empty and connected intersection with all connected components of S. Hence, this kind of object, introduced by Canny, can be used to answer connectivity queries (with applications, for instance, to motion planning) but has also become of central importance in effective real algebraic geometry, since it is used in higher-level algorithms.\nIn this article, we provide a probabilistic algorithm which computes roadmaps for smooth and bounded real algebraic sets. Its output size and running time are polynomial in (nD)nlog (d), where D is the maximum of the degrees of the input polynomials, d is the dimension of the set under consideration and n is the number of variables. More precisely, the running time of the algorithm is essentially subquadratic in the output size. Even under our assumptions, it is the first roadmap algorithm with output size and running time polynomial in (nD)nlog (d).","authors":["Mohab Safey El Din","Eric Schost"],"meta":["January 2016Journal of the ACM 63(6)","DOI:10.1145/2996450"],"references":["265519861_Solving_Zero-Dimensional_Systems_Through_the_Rational_Univariate_Representation","237843092_Degeneracy_Loci_and_Polynomial_Equation_Solving","236737588_Divide_and_Conquer_Roadmap_for_Algebraic_Sets","228917565_On_the_complexity_of_the_D5_principle","221660787_A_Baby_Step-Giant_Step_Roadmap_Algorithm_for_General_Algebraic_Sets","221591163_Computing_Roadmaps_of_Semi-Algebraic_Sets_Extended_Abstract","220171983_Polar_Varieties_Real_Equation_Solving_and_Data_Structures_The_Hypersurface_Case","303436470_The_Numerical_Solution_of_Systems_of_Polynomials_Arising_in_Engineering_and_Science","283429421_On_Hilbert's_function_series_of_composition_of_ideals_and_a_generalization_of_the_theorem_of_Bezout","275027621_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","268927115_On_the_algebraic_theory_of_modular_systems_or_modules_of_polynomials","268619675_Single_Exponential_Path_Finding_in_Semi-algebraic_Sets_Part_II_The_General_Case","268246011_Quelques_points_de_l'histoire_des_varietes_polaires_de_Poncelet_a_nos_jours_Some_points_of_the_history_of_polarized_varieties_from_Poncelet_till_our_days","265461718_Zeros_multiplicities_and_idempotents_for_zero-dimensional_systems","265443037_Generic_Projections","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","263689698_Inversion_of_two_level_circulant_matrices_over_Zp","256644157_On_varieties_in_multiple-projective_spaces","253646084_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_Polynomial_Optimization_over_a_Real_Algebraic_Set","250752274_On_varieties_in_multiple-projective_spaces","248202984_Undergraduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","247199917_Polar_classes_of_singular_varieties","245581099_Basic_Algebraic_Geometry_1","243682383_Ideals_Defined_by_Matrices_and_a_Certain_Complex_Associated_with_Them","242505554_Commutative_Algebra_with_a_View_Toward_Algebraic_Geometry","242390522_Algebraic_Geometry_I_Complex_Projective_Varieties","239552565_The_Complexity_of_Robot_Motion_Planning","238881132_Grundzuge_einer_arithmetischen_Theorie_der_algebraische_Grossen","236215348_Intrinsic_complexity_estimates_in_polynomial_optimization","235602122_Planning_Algorithms","228340800_Generalized_polar_varieties_Geometry_and_algorithms","226371874_Construction_of_roadmaps_in_semi-algebraic_sets","225996594_Polar_Varieties_and_Efficient_Real_Elimination","225371656_On_the_geometry_of_polar_varieties","223868753_Le_role_des_structures_de_donnees_dans_les_problemes_d'elimination","223733087_Straight-line_programs_in_geometric_elimination_theory","223553648_A_homotopy_for_solving_general_polynomial_systems_that_respects_m-homogeneous_structures","223124770_The_complexity_of_partial_derivatives","222789435_Definability_and_fast_quantifier_elimination_in_algebraically_closed_fields","222682013_Finding_at_Least_One_Point_in_Each_Connected_Component_of_a_Real_Algebraic_Set_Defined_by_a_Single_Equation","222675400_A_concise_proof_of_the_Kronecker_polynomial_system_solver_from_scratch","222671424_Change_of_order_for_regular_chains_in_positive_dimension","222569564_A_Grobner_Free_Alternative_for_Polynomial_System_Solving","221591841_Testing_Polynomials_which_Are_Easy_to_Compute_Extended_Abstract","221564432_Change_of_order_for_bivariate_triangular_sets","221564045_Computing_an_equidimensional_decomposition_of_an_algebraic_variety_by_means_of_geometric_resolutions","221563985_Polar_Varieties_and_Computation_of_one_Point_in_each_Connected_Component_of_a_Smooth_Real_Algebraic_Set","221521222_About_a_New_Method_for_Computing_in_Algebraic_Number_Fields","221420600_When_Polynomial_Equation_Systems_Can_Be_Solved_Fast","220452338_A_Baby_StepsGiant_Steps_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_Computing_Roadmaps_in_Smooth_Bounded_Real_Hypersurface","220161338_Real_Solving_for_Positive_Dimensional_Systems","51938556_On_the_complexity_of_computing_with_zero-dimensional_triangular_sets","46958155_Grobner_Bases_a_Computational_Approach_to_Commutative_Algebra","44431646_Commutative_algebra_with_a_view_toward_algebraic_geometry_David_Eisenbud","44380909_Basic_algebraic_geometry_I_R_Shafarevich"]}
