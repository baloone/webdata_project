{"id":"243360162_Hamiltonian-Conserving_Discrete_Canonical_Equations_Based_on_Variational_Difference_Quotients","abstract":"New discrete mechanics based on the assumption of the discrete time is proposed. The discrete mechanics does not contain any continuous differentiation, but contains only difference quotients. Resulting discrete Hamiltonian's canonical equations are single time-step difference equations and exactly conserve the Hamiltonian. The canonical equations give the numerical results more accurately than the Heun scheme and the 4th-order Runge-Kutta scheme.","authors":["Toshiaki Itoh","Kanji Abe"],"meta":["May 1988Journal of Computational Physics 76(1):85-102","DOI:10.1016/0021-9991(88)90132-5"],"references":["243026152_Hamiltonian_differencing_of_fluid_dynamics","242790253_On_the_energy_theorem_for_the_Lagrange_equations_in_the_discrete_case"]}
