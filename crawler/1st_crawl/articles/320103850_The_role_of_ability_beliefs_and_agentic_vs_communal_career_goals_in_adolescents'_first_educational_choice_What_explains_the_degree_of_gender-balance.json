The current study followed a large group of Swedish adolescents as they made their first educational choice, and tested for mediation of gender differences using measures of ability beliefs and career goals, which were collected shortly prior to the choice. Findings revealed strong gender differences in high-tech ability beliefs (e.g. computers), which combined with social ability beliefs (e.g. listening skills) and, to a lesser degree, communal career goals (e.g. helping) explained gender differences in educational choice. A new measure of career goal choice revealed that a majority of the adolescents prefer agentic (e.g. status) over communal goal fulfilment if made to choose, although this preference was stronger amongst the boys. Our results support social cognitive career theory, expectancy-value theory and the goal congruity perspective as they demonstrate how gender differences in educational choice can be understood in terms of differences in competence beliefs and career goals. Furthermore, the results suggest that one reason why gender balanced programs appeal to adolescents is their perceived ability to fulfill both agentic and communal career goals.","authors":["Una Tellhed","Martin Bäckström","Fredrik Björklund"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Vocational Behavior 104","DOI:10.1016/j.jvb.2017.09.008"],"references":["309560816_Will_I_Fit_in_and_Do_Well_The_Importance_of_Social_Belongingness_and_Self-Efficacy_for_Explaining_Gender_Differences_in_Interest_in_STEM_and_HEED_Majors","297719007_The_Times_They_Are_a-Changing_or_Are_They_Not_A_Comparison_of_Gender_Stereotypes_1983-2014","292652992_The_social_psychology_of_gender_across_cultures","325670955_A_model_of_often_mixed_stereotype_content_Competence_and_warmth_respectively_follow_from_perceived_status_and_competition","318186828_Competence_and_confusion_How_stereotype_threat_can_make_you_a_bad_judge_of_your_competence_Competence_and_Confusion","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","309897772_Gender_and_attitudes_toward_technology_use_A_meta-analysis","309021383_Why_are_some_STEM_fields_more_gender_balanced_than_others","299855389_A_Goal_Congruity_Model_of_Role_Entry_Engagement_and_Exit_Understanding_Communal_Goal_Processes_in_STEM_Gender_Gaps"]}
