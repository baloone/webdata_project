{"id":"221156749_A_Semantic_Proximity_Based_System_of_Arabic_Text_Indexation","abstract":"In this paper, we extended the vectorial model of Salton [9], [11], [12] and [14], by adapting the TF-IDF parameter by its\ncombination with the Okapi formula for index terms extraction and evaluation of the in order to identify the relevant concepts\nwhich represent a document.Indeed, we have proposed a new measure TFIDF-ABR which takes in consideration the concept of semantic\nvicinity using a measure of similarity between terms by combining the calculation of TF-IDF-Okapi with a kernel approach (Radial\nBasis function).\n\nThis indexation approach allows a contextual and semantic research. In order to have a robust descriptor index, we used not\nonly a semantic graph to highlight the semantic connections between terms, but also an auxiliary dictionary to increase the\nconnectivity of the constructed graph and therefore the semantic weight of indexation words.","authors":["Taher Zaki","D.
