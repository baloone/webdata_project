{"id":"340706528_Open_access_publication_Academic_colonialism_or_knowledge_philanthropy","abstract":"Open access (OA) publication of scholarly articles in journals has come to be celebrated as opening up new knowledge base to researchers, making knowledge a 'public-good'. What seems to have gone amiss is a deep-seeded exclusion and discrimination that OA furthers by being blind to authors' location. I argue that OA entrenches prevailing 'academic colonialism', without any reflection on transforming existing academic hierarchies. The paper brings forth the idea of academiccolonialism leading to a hierarchization of scholarships, wherein the authors belonging to the so-called Global South stand at a disadvantage.","authors":["Papia Sengupta"],"meta":["April 2020Geoforum 118(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.001"],"references":["304004685_Representation_of_Academics_from_Developing_Countries_as_Authors_and_Editorial_Board_Members_in_Scientific_Journals_Does_this_Matter_to_the_Field_of_Development_Studies","277100197_Review_Essay_Open_Access_and_its_Social_Context_New_Colonialism_in_the_Making","238503600_Neo-colonial_science_by_the_most_industrialised_upon_the_least_developed_countries_in_peer-reviewed_publishing","286961933_'Colonial_and_Postcolonial_Discourse_Cultural_Critique_or_Academic_Colonialism'","272545277_Listening_to_the_Subaltern_The_Poetics_of_Neocolonial_States","49913542_Budapest_Open_Access_Initiative_Frequently_Asked_Questions"]}
