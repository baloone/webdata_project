Studies in the field of science need to be included not only science but also social sciences.\nImportant steps have been taken in the field of high technology in the last quarter of the 20th century. These developments have strongly influenced the field of science and created new concepts, even new branches of science have been created. It is inevitable that the contributions of high technologies to the sciences will have a broader impact on social sciences. In particular, the application of high-tech applications, supported by higher mathematics and computer science applications, will require social sciences to include these sciences in their sciences.\nIn this research, it will be examined what high technology applications can be adopted to the social and human sciences and what needs to be done on this subject. \nKey Words: High Technologies, Social Sciences, Impact of the Technologic Improvements on Social Sciences, Social Sciences in the 21st Century","authors":["Ergun Demirel"],"meta":["July 2019Pressacademia 9(9):242-252","DOI:10.17261/Pressacademia.2019.1099","Project: AN INNOVATIVE ORGANIZATIONAL APPROACH TO FACILITATE RESEARCH STUDIES IN UNIVERSITIES"],"references":["281737158_A_study_on_the_organization_and_management_systems_of_Turkish_shipping_companies","263483647_INNOVATION_IN_MARITIME_EDUCATION_AND_TRAINING","5435466_Conducting_a_Meta-Ethnography_of_Qualitative_Literature_Lessons_Learned","292711112_Maritime_business_during_the_twentieth_century_Continuity_and_change"]}
