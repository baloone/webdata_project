{"id":"326322949_Computability_Towards_a_Philosophy_of_Computer_Science","abstract":"The work of Turing and Church has had a profound inuence on the foundations and development of computer science. Churchâ€™s work on the lambda calculus not only provided one of the central mathematical accounts of computation, but also paved the way for the development of the functional paradigm, and the semantics of programming languages. Turing is regarded as providing the definitive account of computation, inspiring the design of early computers, and giving birth to artificial intelligence.","authors":["Raymond Turner"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-55565-1_22","In book: Computational Artifacts (pp.189-195)"],"references":[]}
