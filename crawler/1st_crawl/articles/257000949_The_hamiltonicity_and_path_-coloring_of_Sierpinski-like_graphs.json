{"id":"257000949_The_hamiltonicity_and_path_-coloring_of_Sierpinski-like_graphs","abstract":"A mapping @f from V(G) to {1,2,...,t} is called a patht-coloring of a graph G if each G[@f^-^1(i)], for 1@?i@?t, is a linear forest. The vertex linear arboricity of a graph G, denoted by vla(G), is the minimum t for which G has a path t-coloring. Graphs S[n,k] are obtained from the Sierpinski graphs S(n,k) by contracting all edges that lie in no induced K\"k. In this paper, the hamiltonicity and path t-coloring of Sierpinski-like graphs S(n,k), S^+(n,k), S^+^+(n,k) and graphs S[n,k] are studied. In particular, it is obtained that vla(S(n,k))=vla(S[n,k])=@?k/2@? for k>=2. Moreover, the numbers of edge disjoint Hamiltonian paths and Hamiltonian cycles in S(n,k), S^+(n,k) and S^+^+(n,k) are completely determined, respectively.","authors":["Bing Xue","Liancui Zuo","Guojun Li"],"meta":["August 2012Discrete Applied Mathematics 160(12):1822â€“1836","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2012.03.022"],"references":["268859598_Codes_and_L21-labelings_in_Sierpinski_graphs","266988884_On_some_metric_properties_of_the_Sierpinski_graphs_Snk","255589088_A_2-parametric_generalization_of_Sierpi_nski_gasket_graphs","234128077_Covering_codes_in_Sierpi'nski_graphs","220543531_The_Hub_Number_of_Sierpinski-Like_Graphs","220189245_Vertex-_edge-_and_total-colorings_of_Sierpinski-like_graphs","285889619_Completeness_of_the_Lipscomb_space","285889205_Growth_in_repeated_truncations_of_maps","282709177_On_the_linear_k-arboricity_of_Kn_and_Knn","278170632_Metric_properties_of_the_Tower_of_Hanoi_graphs_and_Stem's_diatomic_sequence","268996829_Completeness_of_the_Lipscomb_universal_space","268613709_Lipscomb's_LA_Space_Fractalized_in_Hilbert's_l_2_A_Space","266577145_Equitable_L21-labelings_of_Sierpinski_graphs","262366970_Pascal's_Triangle_and_the_Tower_of_Hanoi","262217470_Crossing_numbers_of_Sierpinacuteski-like_graphs","256693713_On_the_linear_k-arboricity_of_K-n_and_K-nK-n","251556739_Coloring_Hanoi_and_Sierpiski_graphs","243033654_1-perfect_codes_in_Sierpinski_graphs","238758234_On_the_linear_n-1-arboricity_of_Knm","229751067_Bounds_for_the_vertex_linear_arboricity","227780822_Crossing_numbers_of_Sierpinski-like_graphs","226845340_Graphs_Sn_k_and_a_Variant_of_the_Tower_of_Hanoi_Problem","226279296_The_Average_Eccentricity_of_Sierpinski_Graphs","222695357_Metric_properties_of_the_Tower_of_Hanoi_graphs_and_Stern's_diatomic_sequence","220569559_On_the_linear_n-1-arboricity_of_K","44466426_Modern_graph_theory_Bela_Bollobas","2360449_Growth_in_Repeated_Truncations_of_Maps","2108968_Shortest_Paths_in_the_Tower_of_Hanoi_Graph_and_Finite_Automata"]}
