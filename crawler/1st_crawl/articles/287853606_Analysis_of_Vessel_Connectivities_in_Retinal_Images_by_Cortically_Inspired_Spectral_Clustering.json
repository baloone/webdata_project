{"id":"287853606_Analysis_of_Vessel_Connectivities_in_Retinal_Images_by_Cortically_Inspired_Spectral_Clustering","abstract":"Retinal images provide early signs of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and\nhypertension. These signs can be investigated based on microaneurysms or\nsmaller vessels. The diagnostic biomarkers are the change of vessel widths and\nangles especially at junctions, which are investigated using the vessel\nsegmentation or tracking. Vessel paths may also be interrupted, crossings and\nbifurcations may be disconnected. This paper addresses a novel contextual\nmethod based on the geometry of the primary visual cortex (V1) to study these\ndifficulties. We have analysed the specific problems at junctions with a\nconnectivity kernel obtained as the fundamental solution of the Fokker-Planck\nequation, which is usually used to represent the geometrical structure of\nmulti-orientation cortical connectivity. By using the spectral clustering on a\nlarge local affinity matrix constructed by both the connectivity kernel and the\nfeature of intensity, the vessels are identified successfully in a hierarchical\ntopology each representing an individual perceptual unit.","authors":["Marta Favali","Samaneh Abbasi-Sureshjani","Bart ter Haar Romeny","Alessandro Sarti"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 56(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10851-016-0640-1","SourcearXiv","Project: RetinaCheck"],"references":["313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","303784750_A_century_of_gestalt_psychology_in_visual_perception_I_Perceptual_grouping_and_figure-ground_organisation","303018781_Heart_Disease_and_Stroke_Statistics-2015_Update_A_Report_from_the_American_Heart_Association","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","301942698_Heart_Rate_Variability_and_Incident_Stroke_The_Atherosclerosis_Risk_in_Communities_Study","300650269_Biologically-Inspired_Supervised_Vasculature_Segmentation_in_SLO_Retinal_Fundus_Images","294282550_Automated_Tracing_of_Retinal_Blood_Vessels_Using_Graphical_Models","288195406_Geometric_methods_for_vessel_visualization_and_quantification_-_a_survey","286535346_Abstract_harmonic_analysis_of_continuous_wavelet_transforms","285058764_Receptive_fields_binocular_interaction_and_functional_architecture_in_the_cat's_visual_cortex"]}
