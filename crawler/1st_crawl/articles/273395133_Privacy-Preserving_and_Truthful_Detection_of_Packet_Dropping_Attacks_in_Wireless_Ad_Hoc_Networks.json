{"id":"273395133_Privacy-Preserving_and_Truthful_Detection_of_Packet_Dropping_Attacks_in_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","abstract":"Link error and malicious packet dropping are two sources for packet losses in multi-hop wireless ad hoc network. In this paper, while observing a sequence of packet losses in the network, we are interested in determining whether the losses are caused by link errors only, or by the combined effect of link errors and malicious drop. We are especially interested in the insider-attack case, whereby malicious nodes that are part of the route exploit their knowledge of the communication context to selectively drop a small amount of packets critical to the network performance. Because the packet dropping rate in this case is comparable to the channel error rate, conventional algorithms that are based on detecting the packet loss rate cannot achieve satisfactory detection accuracy. To improve the detection accuracy, we propose to exploit the correlations between lost packets. Furthermore, to ensure truthful calculation of these correlations, we develop a homomorphic linear authenticator (HLA) based public auditing architecture that allows the detector to verify the truthfulness of the packet loss information reported by nodes. This construction is privacy preserving, collusion proof, and incurs low communication and storage overheads. To reduce the computation overhead of the baseline scheme, a packet-block-based mechanism is also proposed, which allows one to trade detection accuracy for lower computation complexity. Through extensive simulations, we verify that the proposed mechanisms achieve significantly better detection accuracy than conventional methods such as a maximum-likelihood based detection.","authors":["Tao Shu","Marwan Krunz"],"meta":["April 2015IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing 14(4):813-828","DOI:10.1109/TMC.2014.2330818"],"references":["227123843_Providing_Fault-Tolerant_Ad_hoc_Routing_Service_in_Adversarial_Environments","224575008_Detecting_Malicious_Packet_Dropping_in_the_Presence_of_Collisions_and_Channel_Errors_in_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","224251590_Packet-Hiding_Methods_for_Preventing_Selective_Jamming_Attacks","224152426_Selective_Jamming_Attacks_in_Wireless_Networks","222400374_Secure_Message_Transmission_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","221326983_Proofs_of_Storage_from_Homomorphic_Identification_Protocols_Advances_in_Cryptology_C_ASIACRYPT_2009","221244054_Castor_Scalable_Secure_Routing_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks","220411023_Low-power_DoS_attacks_in_data_wireless_LANs_and_countermeasures","220194918_Secure_Traceroute_to_Detect_Faulty_or_Malicious_Routing","220031311_The_Feasibility_of_Launching_and_Detecting_Jamming_Attacks_in_Wireless_Networks","4287805_Routing_amid_Colluding_Attackers","4080576_SORI_A_secure_and_objective_reputation-based_incentive_scheme_for_ad-hoc_networks","3436638_An_Acknowledgment-Based_Approach_for_the_Detection_of_Routing_Misbehavior_in_MANETs","2619498_Mitigating_Routing_Misbehavior_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","2529710_Performance_Analysis_of_the_CONFIDANT_Protocol_Cooperation_Of_Nodes_-_Fairness_In_Dynamic_Ad-hoc_NeTworks","2400396_DSR_The_Dynamic_Source_Routing_Protocol_for_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","313700810_Modelling_incentives_for_collaboration_in_mobile_Ad_Hoc_networks","279063185_ODSBR","275115579_AMD_Audit-based_Misbehavior_Detection_in_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","226582875_Compact_Proofs_of_Retrievability","224500531_Secure_Data_Collection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_Randomized_Dispersive_Routes","224124942_Secure_Data_Collection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_Randomized_Dispersive_Routes","221608919_Provable_Data_Possession_at_Untrusted_Stores","221551480_REAct_Resource-Efficient_Accountability_for_Node_Misbehavior_in_Ad_Hoc_Networks_based_on_Random_Audits","221273015_Dealing_with_Liars_Misbehavior_Identification_via_Renyi-Ulam_Games","221244046_Privacy-Preserving_Public_Auditing_for_Data_Storage_Security_in_Cloud_Computing","220593723_ODSBR_An_on-demand_secure_Byzantine_resilient_routing_protocol_for_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","4140500_TWOACK_Preventing_selfishness_in_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","4051576_Detecting_malicious_packet_dropping_using_statistically_regular_traffic_patterns_in_multihop_wireless_networks_that_are_not_bandwidth_limited","4016366_Reputation_propagation_and_agreement_in_mobile_ad-hoc_networks","2895504_Sprite_A_Simple_Cheat-Proof_Credit-Based_System_for_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks","2872034_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2534160_Stimulating_Cooperation_in_Self-Organizing_Mobile_Ad_Hoc"]}
