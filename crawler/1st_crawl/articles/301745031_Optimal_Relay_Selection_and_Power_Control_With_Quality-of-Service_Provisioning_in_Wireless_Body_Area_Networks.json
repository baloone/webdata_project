{"id":"301745031_Optimal_Relay_Selection_and_Power_Control_With_Quality-of-Service_Provisioning_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","abstract":"A game-theoretic approach is proposed to investigate the problem of relay selection and power control with quality of service constraints in multiple-access wireless body area networks (WBANs). Each sensor node seeks a strategy that ensures the optimal energy efficiency and, at the same time, provides a guaranteed upper bound on the end-to-end packet delay and jitter. The existence of Nash equilibrium for the proposed non-cooperative game is proved, the Nash power control solution is analytically calculated, and a distributed algorithm is provided that converges to a Nash relay selection solution. The game theoretic analysis is then employed in an IEEE 802.15.6-based WBAN to gauge the validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Performance behaviors in terms of energy efficiency and end-to-end delay and jitter are examined for various scenarios. Results demonstrate the merits of the proposed framework, particularly for moving WBANs under severe fading conditions.","authors":["Hussein Moosavi","Francis Minhthang Bui"],"meta":["August 2016IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications 15(8):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TWC.2016.2560820"],"references":["273395960_Interference_Analysis_and_Management_for_Spatially_Reused_Cooperative_Multihop_Wireless_Networks","273392106_Optimal_energy_efficiency_link_adaptation_in_IEEE_802156_IR-UWB_body_area_networks","265416637_Relay_Selection_and_Discrete_Power_Control_for_Cognitive_Relay_Networks_via_Potential_Game","261255821_Adaptive_Routing_for_Dynamic_On-Body_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","260511085_Coalition-Based_Approaches_for_Joint_Power_Control_and_Relay_Selection_in_Cooperative_Networks","259005723_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_A_Survey","258792478_Dynamic_Channel_Modeling_for_Multi-Sensor_Body_Area_Networks","224368624_Transmission_Power_Control_in_Body_Area_Sensor_Networks_for_Healthcare_Monitoring","224082592_Energy-Efficient_Resource_Allocation_in_Wireless_Networks_with_Quality-of-Service_Constraints","302919720_Delay-Aware_Optimization_of_Physical_Layer_Security_in_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","288259648_Fundamentals_of_Queueing_Theory_Fourth_Edition","273474953_Energy-Efficient_Power_Control_for_Multiple-Relay_Cooperative_Networks_Using_Q-Learning","272430929_Power_Control_Game_in_Multisource_Multirelay_Cooperative_Communication_Systems_With_a_Quality-of-Service_Constraint","269328059_Joint_relay_selection_and_transmit_power_control_for_wireless_body_area_networks_coexistence","264983795_A_Survey_on_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_Technologies_and_Design_Challenges","264937723_Analysis_of_Queuing_Delay_and_Medium_Access_Distribution_Over_Wireless_Multihop_PANs","263810573_Energy-Efficient_Topology_Control_With_Selective_Diversity_in_Cooperative_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks_A_Game-Theoretic_Approach","261492274_Surviving_the_RF_smog_Making_Body_Area_Networks_robust_to_cross-technology_interference","260657446_Tree_Formation_with_Physical_Layer_Security_Considerations_in_Wireless_Multi-Hop_Networks","260352982_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Neighbor_Discovery_in_Wireless_Networks","236131947_Energy-Aware_Competitive_Power_Control_in_Relay-Assisted_Interference_Wireless_Networks","226569834_Diffusion_Approximation_as_a_Modelling_Tool","224368621_Cooperative_Communications_in_Ultra-Wideband_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_Channel_Modeling_and_System_Diversity_Analysis","224266059_Energy-Efficient_Space-Time_Coded_Cooperation_in_Outage-Restricted_Multihop_Wireless_Networks","200705570_Digital_Communications","3344091_Power_control_for_wireless_data"]}
