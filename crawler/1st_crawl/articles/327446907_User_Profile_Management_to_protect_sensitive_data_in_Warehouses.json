{"id":"327446907_User_Profile_Management_to_protect_sensitive_data_in_Warehouses","abstract":"A data warehouse presents a rich source of information on the activities of the company and the privacy of individuals. So this source can be used as a very powerful mechanism for discovering the crucial information of company. Hence the importance of implementing security measures which guarantee the data confidentiality by establishing an access control policy. In this direction, several propositions were made, but none are considered as a standard for access management to data warehouses. In this article, we will present our approach that allows first to exploit the permissions defined in the data sources in order to help the administrator to define access permissions to the data warehouse, and then our system will automatically generate the sensitivity level of each data warehouse element according to the permissions granted to an object in the data warehouse. This makes it possible to specify sensitive data in order to protect them against illegal access and to detect inferences.","authors":["Amina Elouazzani","Nouria Harbi","Badir Hassan"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Next Generation Information Technology 9(1):12"],"references":["221038623_Towards_the_Secure_Modelling_of_OLAP_Users'_Behaviour","220933914_Towards_OLAP_Security_Design_-_Survey_and_Research_Issues","312411369_Dynamic_management_of_data_warehouse_security_levels_based_on_user_profiles","284332229_k-Anonymity_A_Model_for_Protecting_Privacy","270276876_Building_the_Data_Warehouse","268689927_An_architecture_for_automatically_developing_secure_OLAP_applications_from_models","265837335_Computer_security","260982382_Data_Warehouse_Systems_in_the_Cloud_Rise_to_the_Benchmarking_Challenge","223806493_Developing_secure_data_warehouses_with_a_UML_extension","223194602_A_UML_20_profile_to_define_security_requirements_for_Data_Warehouses"]}
