{"id":"313247796_Prognostics_of_LiNiMnCoO2-based_lithium-ion_batteries_using_a_novel_battery_degradation_model","abstract":"Some lithium-ion battery materials show two-phase degradation behavior with evident inflection points, such as lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (Li(NiMnCo)O2 or NMC) cells. A model-based Bayesian approach is proposed in this paper to predict remaining useful life (RUL) for these types of batteries. First, a two-term logarithmic model is developed to capture the degradation trends of NMC batteries. By fitting the battery degradation data, it is experimentally demonstrated that the developed model is superior to existing empirical battery degradation models. A particle filteringâ€“based prognostic method is then incorporated into the model to estimate the batteries' possible degradation trajectories. Correspondingly, the RUL values of NMC batteries are expressed in terms of probability density function. The effectiveness of the developed method is verified with our collected experimental data. The results indicate that the proposed prognostic method can achieve higher predictive accuracy than the existing two-term exponential model.","authors":["Fangfang Yang","Dong Wang","Yinjiao Xing","Kwok-Leung Tsui"],"meta":["February 2017Microelectronics Reliability 70","DOI:10.1016/j.microrel.2017.02.002"],"references":["284154682_Modeling_Li-ion_battery_capacity_depletion_in_a_particle_filtering_framework","272646684_Cycle_Life_of_Commercial_Lithium-Ion_Batteries_with_Lithium_Titanium_Oxide_Anodes_in_Electric_Vehicles","260014413_Fight_sample_degeneracy_and_impoverishment_in_particle_filters_A_review_of_intelligent_approaches","257225400_A_review_on_the_key_issues_for_lithium-ion_battery_management_in_electric_vehicles","220509105_Dual_Features_Functional_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Fault_Detection_of_Rechargeable_Batteries","2336175_United_States_Department_of_Commerce","291830912_Remaining_Useful_Life_Prediction_of_Lithium-Ion_Batteries_Based_on_Spherical_Cubature_Particle_Filter","284400420_Cross-Validation","279382592_Encyclopedia_of_Database_Systems","260303872_Prognostics_of_Lithium-Ion_Batteries_Based_on_the_Verhulst_Model_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_and_Particle_Filter","232397330_Prognostics_of_lithium-ion_batteries_based_on_Dempster-Shafer_theory_and_the_Bayesian_Monte_Carlo_method","224224885_Online_State-of-Health_Assessment_for_Battery_Management_Systems","222851917_Simulation_of_Capacity_Fade_in_Lithium-ion_Batteries","3318218_A_Tutorial_on_Particle_Filters_for_Online_NonlinearNon-Gaussian_Bayesian_Tracking"]}
