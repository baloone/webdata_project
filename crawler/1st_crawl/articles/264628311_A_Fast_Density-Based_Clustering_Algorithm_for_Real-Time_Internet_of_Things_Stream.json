{"id":"264628311_A_Fast_Density-Based_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Real-Time_Internet_of_Things_Stream","abstract":"Data streams are continuously generated over time from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The faster all of this data is analyzed, its hidden trends and patterns discovered, and new strategies created, the faster action can be taken, creating greater value for organizations. Density-based method is a prominent class in clustering data streams. It has the ability to detect arbitrary shape clusters, to handle outlier, and it does not need the number of clusters in advance. Therefore, density-based clustering algorithm is a proper choice for clustering IoT streams. Recently, several density-based algorithms have been proposed for clustering data streams. However, density-based clustering in limited time is still a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a density-based clustering algorithm for IoT streams. The method has fast processing time to be applicable in real-time application of IoT devices. Experimental results show that the proposed approach obtains high quality results with low computation time on real and synthetic datasets.","authors":["Amineh Amini","Hadi Saboohi","Teh Ying Wah","Tutut Herawan"],"meta":["June 2014The Scientific World Journal 2014(1):926020","DOI:10.1155/2014/926020","SourcePubMed"],"references":["261457602_Research_on_data_mining_models_for_the_internet_of_things","258442676_On_Density-Based_Data_Streams_Clustering_Algorithms_A_Survey","257877809_Internet_of_things_Where_to_be_is_to_trust","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","303206384_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","303151754_Least_squares_quantization","278710477_Managing_and_Mining_Sensor_Data","277671634_OPTICS","269109785_Machine_Learning_and_Data_Mining_in_Pattern_Recognition","264585236_Data_Mining_for_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey"]}
