{"id":"326185793_Design_of_drone_ambulance","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to develop a prototype of drone ambulance to assist the ambulances in saving human lives. According to a study conducted by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), traffic in it’s 'peak hours’ on an average does not exceed 30-40 km/h 92% of the times. In existing systems, a drone carries only the defibrillator to the emergency spot. Thus, it takes into account only a single parameter. This paper aims at developing a system that would be able to fly to the emergency spot earlier than ambulance and take into account multiple real time health parameters of the patient such as temperature, heart rate and heartbeat. The values of these essential parameters are then transmitted to the ambulance. For this purpose, IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee is used. The range of the drone ambulance is approximately 500m and the range of Zigbee which is 2.4GHz is 10-20m. This helps the doctor to evaluate the situation better. The experimental results of the measured parameters are observed and presented.","authors":["V.V. Krishna","S. Shastri","Shubhra Kulshrestha","A.
