Archaeologists are always interested in\ndocumenting and cataloging underwater sites, while biologists\naim at monitoring and sampling water and biological\nparameters. In addition recreational activities as scuba diving\nand snorkeling demand instruments that are more efficient in\norder to obtain data to share with other sea passionate. These\nactivities has not to be invasive and difficulties increase as work\ndepths increase. Moreover, such kind of users are sometimes not\nfamiliar with complex technologies and robotic systems, or they\nare not able to sustain costs of the actual underwater data\ngathering systems. This paper describes the design and\nrealization of a device, called DiRAMa, and the relative\narchitecture for data gathering in underwater environments.\nThe device is planned to make the image and data acquisition\neasy, and let the user upload all the information on an\nappropriate Web Server as soon as an Internet connection is\navailable. Users can launch 3D reconstruction processes, which\nuse photos and other materials just uploaded, while the Web\nServer sends notification on the mobile device informing about\nelaboration status. This structure gives to scientists and other\ncustomers an economic but efficient instrument for collecting\ndata and obtaining significant results. The described system has\nrevealed to be very effective and innovative; its development\nhave involved the implementation of a complex and integrated\ninfrastructure. Innovation and potentiality brought by DiRAMa\nare introduced, and the general architecture of the system\ndescribed. The validation of the structure out of water and its\nuse in real field mission involving biologists and other scientist is\ndiscussed, together with possible future improvements.","authors":["Paula A Zapata-Ramírez","David Scaradozzi","Laura Sorbi","Francesco Zoppini"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/MED.2014.6961447","Conference: 22nd Mediterranean Conference on Control and AutomationAt: June 16-19, 2014, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"references":["285686968_Innovative_study_methods_for_the_Mediterranean_coralligenous_habitats","271553066_3D_documentation_and_monitoring_of_the_experimental_cleaning_operations_in_the_underwater_archaeological_site_of_Baia_Italy","266031083_Stakeholder_participation_and_the_use_of_web_technology_for_MPA_management","262601905_The_visualization_of_geographical_dataset_on_mobile_devices_using_Augmented_Reality_application_a_case_of_study_from_Liguria_Region","269327715_Electromagnetic_communication_solution_for_scuba-diving","267726627_Tools_and_Techniques_For_Underwater_Archaeological_Sites_Documentation","261276303_Assisted_guidance_system_for_Micro_ROV_in_underwater_data_gathering_missions","261239130_Water_pollution_petrochemical_products_monitoring_system_using_optical_fibre_refractometer","261085038_Detecting_Marine_Oil_Spill_Pollution_Based_on_Borda_Count_Method_of_Ocean_Water_Surface_Image","259913552_New_Tools_and_Methods_for_Precision_Sea_Floor_Mapping"]}
