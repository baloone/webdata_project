{"id":"308632016_A_Preliminary_Study_on_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Algorithm_Approach_for_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","abstract":"Much attention has be drawn by the Travelling salesman problem lately as it is one of the problem in Mathematics and computer science which although is easy to understand but very difficult to solve.\nIn this paper, a preliminary study is undertaken to construct a minimum spanning tree algorithm to approximately solve the TSP.\nAn implementation of the travelling salesman problem using a modified pure minimum spanning tree algorithm is also presented. The propose algorithm provides an evaluation of the cost of a round trip and it executes in practical time. The algorithm verifies from a constructed tour and presents a shortcut path to all destinations. The proposed approach performance is benchmark with a case study.","authors":["Evans Baidoo"],"meta":["September 2016Communications on Applied Electronics 5(10)","DOI:10.5120/cae2016652386"],"references":["283944407_Using_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_Algorithms_for_Evolutionary_Tree_Construction","228057761_On_the_History_of_the_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problem","228057740_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Finding_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_in_Undirected_and_Directed_Graphs","221909777_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_an_Overview_of_Applications_Formulations_and_Solution_Approaches","335803644_Solving_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_using_an_Enhanced_Ant_Colony_Algorithm","319955964_A_swarmed_GA_algorithm_for_solving_travelling_salesman_problem","285382368_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","267059668_Bibliography_on_Algorithms_for_Shortest_Path_Shortest_Spanning_Tree_and_Related_Circuit_Routing_Problems_1956-1974","265453391_The_traveling_salesman_problem_Bibliography","223942561_Minimum-weight_spanning_tree_algorithms_A_survey_and_empirical_study","221131648_A_Parallel_Multi-start_Search_Algorithm_for_Dynamic_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","221048197_TSP_Optimisation_Using_Multi_Tour_Ants","220885622_Scheduling_Problems_and_Traveling_Salesmen_The_Genetic_Edge_Recombination_Operator","220431823_Fibonacci_heaps_and_their_uses_in_improved_network_optimization_algorithms","220045421_Optimization_by_simulated_annealing"]}
