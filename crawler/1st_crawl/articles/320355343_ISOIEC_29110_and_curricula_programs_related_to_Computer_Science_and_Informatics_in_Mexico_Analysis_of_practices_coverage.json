In this context, Computer Science students should acquire at the universities the knowledge required to work under organizations environment especially related to the use of models and standards for improving their quality and productivity. This is a key challenge in very small entities (VSEs) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), because their limitations in time, budget and human resources. This paper presents an analysis of coverage between ISO/IEC 29110 standard, which is used for software industry to ensure quality in Software Engineering practices in VSE, and four academic curricula programs of higher education related to Computer Science and Informatics. The results show some gaps in the Mexican curricula programs that can be reinforced to provide engineers with the knowledge and abilities regarding the use of software engineering best practices, expected in VSE and SME using ISO/IEC 29110. Besides, the analysis shows why ISO/IEC 29110 is easily implemented in this type of organizations.","authors":["Mirna Muñoz","Adriana Peña Pérez Negrón","Jezreel Mejia","Graciela Lara López"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-69341-5_1","Conference: International Conference on Software Process Improvement"],"references":["310390594_Actual_state_of_the_coverage_of_Mexican_software_industry_requested_knowledge_regarding_the_project_management_best_practices","307586577_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_SPI_and_SMEs_in_Educational_Settings_A_Learning_Tool_Supporting_ISOIEC_29110","304778603_Systems_and_Software_Engineering_Standards_for_Very_Small_Entities_Accomplishments_and_Overview_-_IEEE_Computer","303910720_Software_Process_Improvement_in_Industry_in_a_Graduate_Software_Engineering_Curriculum","274634789_An_Innovative_Approach_in_Developing_Standard_Professionals_by_Involving_Software_Engineering_Students_in_Implementing_and_Improving_International_Standards","236395131_Systems_and_Software_Engineering_Standards_for_Very_Small_Entities","305821135_Coverage_of_the_university_curricula_for_the_Software_Engineering_industry_in_Mexico","302973653_A_Learning_Tool_for_the_ISOIEC_29110_Standard_Understanding_the_Project_Management_of_Basic_Profile","292130978_Analysis_of_Coverage_of_Moprosoft_Practices_in_Curricula_Programs_Related_to_Computer_Science_and_Informatics"]}
