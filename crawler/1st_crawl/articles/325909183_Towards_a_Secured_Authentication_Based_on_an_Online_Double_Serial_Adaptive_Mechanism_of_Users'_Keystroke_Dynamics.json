{"id":"325909183_Towards_a_Secured_Authentication_Based_on_an_Online_Double_Serial_Adaptive_Mechanism_of_Users'_Keystroke_Dynamics","abstract":"Password based applications are commonly used in our daily lives such as in social networks, e-mails, e-commerce, and e-banking. Given the increasing number of hacker attacks, only the use of passwords is not enough to protect personal data and does not meet usability requirements. Keystroke dynamics is a promising solution that decreases the vulnerability of passwords to guessing attacks by analyzing the typing manner of the user. Despite its efficiency in the discrimination between users, it remains non-industrialized essentially due to the tedious learning phase and the intra-class variation of the users' characteristics. In this paper, we propose a double serial mechanism to adapt the user's model over time. An important property of the proposed solution relies in its usability as we only use a single sample as user's reference during the account creation. We demonstrate that the proposed method offers competitive performances while keeping a high usability.","authors":["Abir Mhenni","Estelle Cherrier","Christophe Rosenberger","Najoua ESSOUKRI BEN AMARA"],"meta":["June 2018","Conference: The Twelfth International Conference on Digital Society and eGovernments ICDS 2018At: Rome, Italy"],"references":["305705432_Keystroke_template_update_with_adapted_thresholds","300333945_Context-Sensitive_Self-Updating_for_Adaptive_Face_Recognition","272408120_Face_Recognition_on_Consumer_Devices_Reflections_on_Replay_Attacks","271727804_A_Survey_on_Antispoofing_Schemes_for_Fingerprint_Recognition_Systems","311894603_Adaptive_techniques_for_intra-user_variability_in_keystroke_dynamics","304554974_Adaptive_approaches_for_keystroke_dynamics","301738858_Enhanced_template_update_Application_to_keystroke_dynamics","293640873_Small_fingerprint_scanners_used_in_mobile_devices_The_impact_on_biometric_performance","282912950_Measuring_real-world_accuracies_and_biases_in_modeling_password_guessability","282296244_Biometric_template_update_under_facial_aging","264244834_Identifying_emotion_by_keystroke_dynamics_and_text_pattern_analysis","262320873_GREYC_Keystroke_a_Benchmark_for_Keystroke_Dynamics_Biometric_Systems","261723760_Can_long_passwords_be_secure_and_usable","268441161_Automatic_Template_Update_Strategies_for_Biometrics","260664389_Critical_analysis_of_adaptive_biometric_systems"]}
