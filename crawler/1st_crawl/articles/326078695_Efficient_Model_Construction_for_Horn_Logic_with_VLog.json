{"id":"326078695_Efficient_Model_Construction_for_Horn_Logic_with_VLog","abstract":"We extend the Datalog engine VLog to develop a column-oriented implementation of the skolem and the restricted chase – two variants of a sound and complete algorithm used for model construction over theories of existential rules. We conduct an extensive evaluation over several data-intensive theories with millions of facts and thousands of rules, and show that VLog can compete with the state of the art, regarding runtime, scalability, and memory efficiency.","authors":["Jacopo Urbani","Markus Krötzsch","Ceriel Jacobs","Irina-Teodora Dragoste"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-94205-6_44","In book: Automated Reasoning (pp.680-688)"],"references":["315379943_That's_All_Folks_Llunatic_Goes_Open_Source","300338060_RDFox_A_Highly-Scalable_RDF_Store","225035500_Foundations_of_Databases","220957481_Taming_the_Infinite_Chase_Query_Answering_under_Expressive_Relational_Constraints","200034372_Complexity_and_Expressive_Power_of_Logic_Programming","318829969_Logic_on_MARS_Ontologies_for_Generalised_Property_Graphs","318829743_Detecting_Chase_NonTermination_for_Existential_Rules_with_Disjunctions","315380028_Benchmarking_the_Chase","313680135_Column-Oriented_Datalog_Materialization_for_Large_Knowledge_Graphs","313065982_Ontologies_for_Knowledge_Graphs_Breaking_the_Rules","305081646_Functional_Dependencies_Unleashed_for_Scalable_Data_Exchange","300590310_Design_and_Implementation_of_the_LogicBlox_System","289921078_PDQ_Proof-driven_query_answering_over_web-based_data","282066120_Graal_A_Toolkit_for_Query_Answering_with_Existential_Rules","276347140_SociaLite_An_Efficient_Graph_Query_Language_Based_on_Datalog","262572235_The_incredible_ELK","262323522_Acyclicity_Notions_for_Existential_Rules_and_Their_Application_to_Query_Answering_in_Ontologies","220957147_Consequence-Driven_Reasoning_for_Horn_SHIQ_Ontologies","2756569_Expressive_Power_and_Data_Complexity_of_Nonrecursive_Logic_Programming","2566500_Data_Exchange_Semantics_and_Query_Answering"]}
