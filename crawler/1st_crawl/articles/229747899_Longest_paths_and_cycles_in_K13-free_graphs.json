{"id":"229747899_Longest_paths_and_cycles_in_K13-free_graphs","abstract":"In this article we show that the standard results concerning longest paths and cycles in graphs can be improved for K1,3-free graphs. We obtain as a consequence of these results conditions for the existence of a hamiltonian path and cycle in K1,3-free graphs.","authors":["Manton M.
