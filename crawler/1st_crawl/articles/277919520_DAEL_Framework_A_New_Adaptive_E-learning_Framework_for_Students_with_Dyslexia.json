{"id":"277919520_DAEL_Framework_A_New_Adaptive_E-learning_Framework_for_Students_with_Dyslexia","abstract":"This paper reports on an extensive study conducted on the existing frameworks and relevant theories that lead to a better understanding of the requirements of an e-learning tool for people with dyslexia. The DAEL framework has been developed with respect to four different dimensions: presentation, hypermediality, acceptability and accessibility, and user experience. However, there has been no research on the different types of dyslexia and the dyslexic user's viewpoint as they affect application design. Therefore, in this paper a framework is proposed which would conform to the standards of acceptability and accessibility for dyslexic students. We hypothesise that an e-learning application, which will adopt itself according to individuals’ dyslexia types, will advantage the dyslexics’ individuals in their learning process.","authors":["Aisha Alsobhi","Nawaz Khan","Harjinder Rahanu"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia Computer Science 51(1):1947-1956","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.459"],"references":["250797661_Access_All_Areas_disability_technology_and_learning","319394193_Designing_Web_Usability_The_Practice_of_Simplicity","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","285494425_Dyslexia_and_Virtual_Learning_Environment_Interfaces","271551618_An_evaluation_of_accessibility_of_e-learning_for_dyslexic_students","270819200_The_Design_of_Everyday_Things","267209653_Toward_Linking_Dyslexia_Types_and_Symptoms_to_the_Available_Assistive_Technologies","257926467_E-Learning_Strategies_for_Delivering_Knowledge_in_the_Digital_Age","236157148_Principles_and_Guidelines_in_Software_User_Interface_Design","232815115_Usability_Case_Study_of_Adapted_E-Learning_Course_for_Dyslexic_Students","232487566_Depth_of_Processing_and_the_Retention_of_Words_in_Episodic_Memory","228974172_The_evolution_of_research_on_dyslexia","228658578_Assessing_the_acceptability_of_Adaptive_E-Learning_System","233816976_The_Effects_of_Self-Efficacy_on_Computer_Usage"]}
