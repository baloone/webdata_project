{"id":"337247257_Field-aligned_Quadrangulation_for_Image_Vectorization","abstract":"Image vectorization is an important yet challenging problem, especially when the input image has rich content. In this paper, we develop a novel method for automatically vectorizing natural images with feature‐aligned quad‐dominant meshes. Inspired by the quadrangulation methods in 3D geometry processing, we propose a new directional field optimization technique by encoding the color gradients, sidestepping the explicit computing of salient image features. We further compute the anisotropic scales of the directional field by accommodating the distance among image features. Our method is fully automatic and efficient, which takes only a few seconds for a 400×400 image on a normal laptop. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various image editing applications.","authors":["Guangshun Wei","Yuanfeng Zhou","Xifeng Gao","Qian Ma"],"meta":["October 2019Computer Graphics Forum 38(7):171-180","DOI:10.1111/cgf.13826"],"references":["326463904_QuadriFlow_A_Scalable_and_Robust_Method_for_Quadrangulation","325963756_Progress_on_Developing_a_Multi-physics_Simulation_Platform_Rigorous_Advanced_Plasma_Integration_Testbed_RAPIT","318120027_Constructing_IGA-suitable_planar_parameterization_from_complex_CAD_boundary_by_domain_partition_and_globallocal_optimization","283889371_Frame_Field_Generation_through_Metric_Customization","271463038_GrabCut_in_One_Cut","224377985_A_Computational_Approach_To_Edge_Detection","221890306_A_Subdivision-Based_Representation_for_Vector_Image_Editing","221249005_A_quadrilateral_rendering_primitive","220183704_Geometry_Aware_Direction_Field_Processing","220183632_Automatic_and_Topology-Preserving_Gradient_Mesh_Generation_for_Image_Vectorization","220183521_Patch-Based_Image_Vectorization_with_Automatic_Curvilinear_Feature_Alignment","52012613_Restricted_Delaunay_Triangulations_and_Normal_Cycle","38086781_Metric-Driven_RoSy_Field_Design_and_Remeshing","38015406_TurboPixels_Fast_Superpixels_Using_Geometric_Flows","29617851_N-Symmetry_Direction_Field_Design","328733839_The_Essentials_of_CAGD","320329997_Interactive_Shape_Editing_for_Subdivision_Surfaces","318780335_Patch-Based_Image_Vectorization_with_Automatic_Curvilinear_Feature_Alignment","301316277_A_Colour_Interpolation_Scheme_for_Topologically_Unrestricted_Gradient_Meshes","286245681_Strict_Minimizers_For_Geometric_Optimization","283767822_Quantized_Global_Parametrization","283334005_Instant_Field-Aligned_Meshes","275482966_Fast_Multipole_Representation_of_Diffusion_Curves_and_Points","275103806_Truncated_hierarchical_Catmull-Clark_subdivision_with_local_refinement","267929601_A_Vectorial_Framework_for_Ray_Traced_Diffusion_Curves","262411900_Controlled-Distortion_Constrained_Global_Parametrization","262352155_Integer-Grid_Maps_for_Reliable_Quad_Meshing","262345203_QEx_Robust_Quad_Mesh_Extraction","229895524_GIzMOs_Genuine_Image_Mosaics_with_Adaptive_Tiling","222416311_Image_compression_by_linear_splines_over_adaptive_triangulations","221316549_Estimating_Differential_Quantities_Using_Polynomial_Fitting_of_Osculating_Jets","220507005_Pinchmaps_Textures_with_customizable_discontinuities","220184326_Image_vectorization_using_optimized_gradient_meshes","220183598_Mixed-Integer_Quadrangulation","2880253_Illustrating_Smooth_Surfaces"]}
