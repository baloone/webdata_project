{"id":"294285236_Enzymatic_Coagulation_of_Milk","abstract":"The enzymatic gelation of milk is one of the most studied topics in food colloids, as the reaction is based on the gradual hydrolysis of a polyelectrolyte layer on the surface of the casein micelles. The loss of the polyelectrolyte layer causes the destabilization of these protein particles in milk, and results in aggregates and a gel network. This chapter discusses the mechanisms of rennet-induced gelation of milk, with particular attention to the release of caseinomacropeptide from Îº-casein and the rennet-induced aggregation of casein micelles. These two phases are strictly dependent on temperature, pH and the presence of calcium and other components in milk. The recent findings on the effects of heating, high pressure and concentration on enzymatic coagulation are also described.","authors":["Milena Corredig","E.
