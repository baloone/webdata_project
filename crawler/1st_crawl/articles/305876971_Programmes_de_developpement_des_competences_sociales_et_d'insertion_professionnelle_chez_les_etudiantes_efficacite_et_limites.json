In this context, programs for students aimed at developing these skills have been created. This article presents eight of these programs and for each one, the specific objectives, contents (pedagogies, targeted social skills, and duration), assessments conducted and results are described, compared and analyzed. In highlighting the criteria of effectiveness of these programs and their limitations, the aim is to reveal findings and useful proposals for action for the implementation of future programs.","authors":["Lucie Hernandez"],"meta":["September 2016Orientation Scolaire et Professionnelle","DOI:10.4000/osp.5026"],"references":["289468282_Beyond_social_capital_How_social_skills_can_enhance_entrepreneurs_success","288566952_Developing_Career_Skills_of_Professional_Students_Through_Student_Mentees_-_Alumni_Mentoring_Program","356322989_Fostering_and_Measuring_Skills_Improving_Cognitive_and_Non-Cognitive_Skills_to_Promote_Lifetime_Success","349797030_Mobilisation_et_construction_de_l'experience_dans_un_modele_de_la_competence","327538319_L'apprentissage_par_projet","302010165_L'evolution_des_conditions_d'insertion_professionnelle_des_etudiants","298796316_Designing_And_Evaluating_A_Personal_Skills_Development_Program_For_Management_Education","294280188_De_l'insertion_a_la_socialisation_Mission_locale_jeunes_16-25_ans_et_problematique_de_l'exclusion","282913485_Psychologie_de_la_creativite","280995212_Assessment_of_Children's_Social_Skills_Recent_Developments_Best_Practices_and_New_Directions"]}
