{"id":"281454053_Twitter_event_detection_combining_wavelet_analysis_and_topic_inference_summarization","abstract":"Today streaming text mining plays an important role within\nreal-time social media mining. Given the amount and cadence of the data\ngenerated by those platforms, classical text mining techniques are not\nsuitable to deal with such new mining challenges. Event detection is no\nexception, available algorithms rely on text mining techniques applied to\npre-known datasets processed with no restrictions about computational\ncomplexity and required execution time per document analysis.\nThis work presents a lightweight event detection using wavelet signal\nanalysis of hashtag occurrences in the twitter public stream. It also proposes\na strategy to describe detected events using a Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation topic inference model based on Gibbs Sampling. Peak detection\nusing Continuous Wavelet Transformation achieved good results in\nthe identification of abrupt increases on the mentions of specific hashtags.\nThe combination of this method with the extraction of topics from\ntweets with hashtag mentions proved to be a viable option to summarize\ndetected twitter events in streaming environments.","authors":["Mário Cordeiro"],"meta":["January 2012","Conference: DSIE’12, the Doctoral Symposium on Informatics Engineering"],"references":["242472777_The_applicationjson_Media_Type_for_JavaScript_Object_Notation_JSON","223080854_The_early_bird_catches_the_news_Nine_things_you_should_know_about_micro-blogging","221653277_Fast_collapsed_Gibbs_sampling_for_latent_Dirichlet_allocation","221620547_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","319770399_Approximate_nearest_neighbors_towards_removing_the_curse_of_dimensionality","312775005_MapReduce_Simplified_data_processing_on_large_clusters","291737929_Event_detection_in_twitter","229862116_Kolmogorov-Zurbenko_filters","221653450_Efficient_methods_for_topic_model_inference_on_streaming_document_collections","221620629_Spatial_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation"]}
