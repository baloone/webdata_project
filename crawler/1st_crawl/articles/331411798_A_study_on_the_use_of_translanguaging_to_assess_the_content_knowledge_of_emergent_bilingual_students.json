{"id":"331411798_A_study_on_the_use_of_translanguaging_to_assess_the_content_knowledge_of_emergent_bilingual_students","abstract":"Translanguaging is a commonly used pedagogical tool in bilingual classrooms. In the era of the Common Core State Standards, applying translanguaging in assessments written to the common core may support emergent bilinguals in their effort to demonstrate their content knowledge. This study investigated the design and implementation of technology-enhanced translanguaging features on a computer based mathematics assessment. Ten items composed of multiple choice and constructed response opportunities were enhanced with several translanguaging features including English, Spanish, or both languages. Test takers were able to see the item and options, listen to the item and options, write their response, say their response, show synonyms to minimize dialect variation, all in English, Spanish, or any combination of both languages. Ten emergent bilingual students participated in cognitive laboratories designed to collect data on usability and perception of the usefulness of the translanguaging features. Findings and implications for future assessment are discussed.","authors":["Alexis Lopez","Danielle Guzman-Orth","Sultan Turkan"],"meta":["March 2014","Conference: American Association of Applied Linguistics","Project: Translanguaging"],"references":["315816026_Conceptualizing_the_Use_of_Translanguaging_in_Initial_Content_Assessments_for_Newly_Arrived_Emergent_Bilingual_Students","279558643_Translanguaging_in_the_Classroom_Emerging_Issues_for_Research_and_Pedagogy","324972167_14_Linguistic_Third_Spaces_in_Education_Teachers'_Translanguaging_across_the_Bilingual_Continuum_Languages_Policies_Pedagogies","317953721_Educating_emergent_bilinguals_policies_programs_and_practices_for_English_language_learners","305247830_Language_Bilingualism_and_Education","284957091_The_translanguaging_of_Latino_kindergarteners","284388758_Education_multilingualism_and_translanguaging_in_the_21st_century","266470605_Trends_in_Unauthorized_Immigration_Undocumented_Inflow_Now_Trails_Legal_Inflow","251586615_Moment_Analysis_and_translanguaging_space_Discursive_construction_of_identities_by_multilingual_Chinese_youth_in_Britain","233441048_Translanguaging_and_Transnational_Literacies_in_Multilingual_Classrooms_A_Biliteracy_Lens","230359961_Codemeshing_in_Academic_Writing_Identifying_Teachable_Strategies_of_Translanguaging","230316113_Assessing_Multilingual_Competencies_Adopting_Construct_Valid_Assessment_Policies","227867913_Translanguaging_in_the_Bilingual_Classroom_A_Pedagogy_for_Learning_and_Teaching"]}
