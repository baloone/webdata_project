{"id":"220122216_Optimum_Grip_of_a_Polygon","abstract":"It has been shown by B.S. Baker, S. Fortune, and E. Grosse that any two-dimensional polygonal object can be prehended stably with three fingers so that its weight (along the third dimension) is balanced. In this paper we show that form closure of a polygonal object can be achieved by four fingers (previous proofs were not complete). We formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimum stable grip or form closure of any given polygon. For a stable grip it is most natural to minimize the forces needed to balance through friction the object's weight along the third dimension. For form closure, we minimize the worst-case forces needed to balance any unit force acting on the center of gravity of the object. The mathematical techniques used in the two instances are an interesting mix of optimization and Euclidean geometry. Our results lead to algorithms for the efficient computation of the optimum grip in each case.","authors":["Xanthippi Markenscoff","Christos H.
