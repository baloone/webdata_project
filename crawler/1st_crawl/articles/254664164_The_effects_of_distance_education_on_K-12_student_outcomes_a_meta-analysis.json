{"id":"254664164_The_effects_of_distance_education_on_K-12_student_outcomes_a_meta-analysis","abstract":"This meta-analysis is a statistical review of 14 studies with 116 effect sizes from web-delivered K-12 distance education programs studied between 1999 and 2004. The analysis shows that distance education can have the same effect on measures of student academic achievement when compared to traditional instruction. The study-weighted mean effect size across all outcomes was -0.028. No factors were found to be related to significant positive or negative effects. The factors that were tested included academic content area, grade level of the students, role of the distance learning program, role of the instructor, length of the program, type of school, frequency of the distance learning experience, pacing of instruction, timing of instruction, instructor preparation and experience in distance education, and the setting of the students. Online virtual schools may be ideally suited to meet the needs of stakeholders calling for school choice, high school reform, and workforce preparation in 21st century skills. The growth in the numbers of students learning online and the importance of online learning as a solution to educational challenges has increased the need to study more closely the factors that effect student learning in virtual schooling environments. This meta-analysis is a statistical review of web- delivered K-12 distance education programs conducted in order to determine how student learning in online programs compares to learning in classroom-based programs, to identify the specific factors that influence student learning, and to make recommendations for improving practice in K-12 distance education.","authors":["Cathy Cavanaugh","Kathy Gillan","Jeff Kromrey","Melinda Hess"],"meta":["January 2004"],"references":[]}
