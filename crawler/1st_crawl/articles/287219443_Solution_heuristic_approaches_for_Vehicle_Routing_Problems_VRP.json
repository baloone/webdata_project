{"id":"287219443_Solution_heuristic_approaches_for_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_VRP","abstract":"In this study we sought an understanding of heuristic approaches for solving vehicle routing problem (VRP), and some algorithms can be used to facilitate obtaining optimal solutions for different types of models of Operations Research (OR), including some types of models of Linear Programming (LP), these have a proven invaluable in solving practical problems. This is the case of most of the routing problems. For these complex problems, the optimization techniques used to achieve near-optimal solutions such as heuristics. The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is of great complexity and thus the goal of this work focuses on the heuristic approach. In this study highlighted three approaches, seeking to understand and use in solving these problems.","authors":["Joaquim Rodrigo Oliveira","Antônio Sérgio Coelho"],"meta":["January 2015","Project: Solução de problemas da manufatura: agendamento em job-shop"],"references":[]}
