After defining the research question and specifying the methodological orientations of our work, the article presents its main results. These include the demystification of the power of ICT on the learning process, the role of \"analyzer\" which ICT can play in the treatment of fundamental pedagogical questions, the revelation of a set of tensions favorable to the development of professional \"posture\" as well as of the importance of taking into account trainees’ personal factors (cognitive, motivational, emotional and biological) when designing the training system and curriculum. This text pursues two objectives: sharing the results of this work with the scientific community in view of launching new research in this area and connecting with practitioners so that better conditions of \"learnance\" in teacher training might be achieved.","authors":["Lameul Geneviève"],"meta":["January 2008Savoirs 17(2)","DOI:10.3917/savo.017.0071"],"references":[]}
