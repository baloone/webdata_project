{"id":"313218813_The_New_performance_management_paradigm_Capitalizing_on_the_unrealized_potential_of_360_degree_feedback","abstract":"Many business executives and human resources professionals today would argue that performance management (PM) processes have failed to meet, let alone exceed, the expectations of most organizations. A number of popular management books have highlighted these concerns with calls to abandon PM systems altogether (e.g., Cohens & Jenkins, 2002; Culbert & Rout, 2010), and some organizations such as Adobe are experimenting with that very concept having banished their PMP in 2012 (Robinson, 2013). The “why’s” for these barriers to effective PM have been well-documented, and we will not repeat them here. While there is\nconsiderable theory and research regarding various aspects of the PM process (see Smither & London, 2009) and there have been many proposals, case studies and guidelines suggesting possible improvements (e.g., Corporate Leadership Council 2002, Lloyd, 2009), one area that has received insufficient consideration and even outright rejection by some practitioners is the use of 360 feedback as an integral part of performance management systems.","authors":["David Bracken","Allan H.
