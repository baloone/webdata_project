{"id":"234077466_Analysis_of_sliding_modes_in_the_frequency_domain","abstract":"A frequency-domain approach to the analysis of real and ideal sliding modes (SM) in single input single output (SISO) systems with linear plants is proposed. The real SM is analysed as a superposition of fast oscillations and slow motions in a relay system. The approach is based on the notion of the locus of a perturbed relay system (LPRS). The proposed LPRS is defined as a characteristic of the response of a linear part to an unequally spaced pulse control of variable frequency in a closed-loop. Formulas for computing the LPRS are derived. It is demonstrated that beside the well know chattering phenomenon, real SM also exhibits a non-ideal disturbance rejection, which can be quantitatively assessed with the use of the proposed approach. An example of the LPRS analysis of a SM system is given.","authors":["Igor Boiko"],"meta":["September 2005International Journal of Control 78(13):969-981","DOI:10.1080/00207170500171329"],"references":["245373298_An_Invariance_Principle_for_Discontinuous_Dynamic_Systems_With_Application_to_a_Coulomb_Friction_Oscillator","287412334_Linearization_of_relay_servo_system_with_respect_to_control_signal","267060388_Fundamental_Theory_of_Servomechanisms","264961768_Sliding_Modes_in_Systems_with_Asymptotic_State_Observers","253730036_Oscillations_in_Systems_with_Relay_Feedback","245373307_Sliding_Mode_Observer-Based_Synthesis_of_State_Derivative-Free_Model_Reference_Adaptive_Control_of_Distributed_Parameter_Systems","243460146_Hours_Control_Systems","230873496_Sliding_Mode_in_Control_Optimization","229358861_The_variable_structure_servomechanism","227534951_Frequency_domain_analysis_of_fast_and_slow_motions_in_sliding_modes"]}
