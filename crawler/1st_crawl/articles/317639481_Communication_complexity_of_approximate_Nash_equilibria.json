For n-player binary-action games we prove an exp(n) lower bound for the (randomized) communication complexity of (Ñ,Ñ)-weak approximate Nash equilibrium, which is a profile of mixed actions such that at least (1âÑ)-fraction of the players are Ñ-best replying.","authors":["Yakov Babichenko","Aviad Rubinstein"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3055399.3055407","Conference: the 49th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["315782539_Communication_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibrium_in_Two-Player_Games","315514474_Query-to-Communication_Lifting_for_BPP","286512949_Distributed_Methods_for_Computing_Approximate_Equilibria","283532081_Well-Supported_versus_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_Query_Complexity_of_Large_Games","235633972_On_the_Communication_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","235509448_Learning_Equilibria_of_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","222434531_Global_Nash_Convergence_of_Foster_and_Young's_Regret_Testing","220616737_The_Complexity_of_Computing_a_Nash_Equilibrium","220431954_Computing_correlated_equilibria_in_multi-player_games","4815368_Rational_Learning_Leads_to_Nash_Equilibrium","4768470_Global_Nash_Convergence_of_Foster_and_Young's_Regret_Testing","345772508_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Approximate_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria","345772501_On_the_Communication_Complexity_of_Approximate_Fixed_Points","315515501_Lifting_randomized_query_complexity_to_randomized_communication_complexity","314908663_Stochastic_Uncoupled_Dynamics_and_Nash_Equilibrium","311569080_Distributed_Methods_for_Computing_Approximate_Equilibria","311490964_Can_Almost_Everybody_be_Almost_Happy","303992881_Settling_the_complexity_of_computing_approximate_two-player_Nash_equilibria","302887909_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","286007129_Barriers_to_Near-Optimal_Equilibria","265413650_Polynomial-time_Computation_of_Exact_Correlated_Equilibrium_in_Compact_Games","262338415_Inapproximability_of_Nash_Equilibrium","262071856_Computational_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibrium_in_Large_Games","246251289_From_Imitation_Games_to_Kakutani","243458309_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","238048545_Completely_Uncoupled_Dynamics_and_Nash_Equilibria","237092124_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibrium","236871805_The_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibria","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","228108257_Non-Cooperative_Games","226831896_Super-logarithmic_depth_lower_bounds_via_the_direct_sum_in_communication_complexity","223354618_Exponential_Lower_Bounds_for_Finding_Brouwer_Fixed_Points","222663146_How_long_to_equilibrium_The_communication_complexity_of_uncoupled_equilibrium_procedures","222399823_Stochastic_Uncoupled_Dynamics_and_Nash_Equilibria","221591946_On_Notions_of_Information_Transfer_in_VLSI_Circuits","209409872_Strategic_Learning_and_Its_Limits","24089548_Regret_Testing_Learning_to_Play_Nash_Equilibrium_Without_Knowing_You_Have_an_Opponent","23984496_Learning_by_Trial_and_Error","4727060_Uncoupled_Dynamics_Do_Not_Lead_to_Nash_Equilibrium","2946602_Communication_Complexity_as_a_Lower_Bound_for_Learning_in_Games","2862728_Playing_Large_Games_using_Simple_Strategies","2645573_Separation_of_the_Monotone_NC_Hierarchy","2462607_Monotone_Circuits_for_Matching_Require_Linear_Depth","1764892_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria"]}
