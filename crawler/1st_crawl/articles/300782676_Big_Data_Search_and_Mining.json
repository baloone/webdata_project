{"id":"300782676_Big_Data_Search_and_Mining","abstract":"Most enterprises are generating data at an unprecedented way. On the other hand, traditional consumers are transforming into digital consumers due to high adoption of social media and networks by individuals. Since transactions on these sites are huge and increasing rapidly, social networks have become the new target for several business applications. Big Data mining deals with tapping large amount of data that is complex with a wide variety of data types and provides actionable insights at the right time. The search and mining applications over Big Data resulted in the development of a new kind of technologies, platforms, and frameworks. This chapter introduces the notion of search and data mining in the Big Data context and technologies supporting Big Data. We also present some data mining techniques that deal with scalability and heterogeneity of large data. We further discuss clustering social networks using topology discovery and also address the problem of evaluating and managing text-based sentiments from social network media. Further, this chapter accentuates some of the open source tools for Big Data mining.","authors":["Pisipati Radha Krishna"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-81-322-2494-5_4","In book: Big Data (pp.93-120)"],"references":["262273728_Bifet_A_Mining_Big_Data_Current_Status_and_Forecast_to_the_Future_SIGKDD_Explorations_142_1-5","226951782_Graph_Mining_Applications_to_Social_Network_Analysis","44326491_MOA_massive_online_analysis","7837809_Clique_Percolation_in_Random_Networks","1955091_Fast_Approximation_of_Centrality","318393760_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","312775005_MapReduce_Simplified_data_processing_on_large_clusters","312455832_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","282934139_A_Scalable_Algorithm_for_Discovering_Topologies_in_Social_Networks","282296391_SE-CDA_A_scalable_and_efficient_community_detection_algorithm","262166945_A_generic_topology_discovery_approach_for_huge_social_networks","255469466_Mathematical_Properties_and_Analysis_of_Google's_PageRank","251988841_Analyzing_Internet_Slang_for_Sentiment_Mining","228640508_Comparing_Distributed_Indexing_To_MapReduce_or_Not","224093308_PEGASUS_A_peta-scale_graph_mining_system_-_Implementation_and_observations","221614271_Fast_centrality_approximation_in_modular_networks","220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","215470760_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","45925845_GraphLab_A_New_Framework_for_Parallel_Machine_Learning","8463952_Fast_algorithm_for_detecting_community_structure_in_networks_Phys_Rev_E_Stat_Nonlin_Soft_Matter_Phys_696_Pt_2_066133","2887625_A_Faster_Algorithm_for_Betweenness_Centrality"]}
