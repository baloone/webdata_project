{"id":"220986101_On_the_Implementation_of_Weight_Constraint_Rules_in_Conflict-Driven_ASP_Solvers","abstract":"We present the first comprehensive approach to integrating cardinality and weight rules into conflict-driven ASP solving.\nWe begin with a uniform, constraint-based characterization of answer sets in terms of nogoods. This provides the semantic\nunderpinnings of our approach in fixing all necessary inferences that must be supported by an appropriate implementation.\nWe then provide key algorithms detailing the salient features needed for implementing weight constraint rules. This involves\na sophisticated unfounded set checker as well as an extended propagation algorithm along with the underlying data structures.\nWe implemented our techniques within the ASP solver clasp and demonstrate their effectiveness by an experimental evaluation.","authors":["Martin Gebser","Roland Kaminski","Benjamin Kaufmann","Torsten Schaub"],"meta":["July 2009Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-02846-5_23","SourceDBLP","Conference: Logic Programming, 25th International Conference, ICLP 2009, Pasadena, CA, USA, July 14-17, 2009.
