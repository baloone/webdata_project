The data needs to be stored efficiently, kept protected from malicious agents, analyzed properly as well as quickly and results derived as per demands. Storing data in NoSQL databases is such advancement in technology. The article deals with brushing up of the main properties of SQL databases and then going into what kicked off the development of NoSQL databases, the CAP-Theorem. It then clearly explains the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases and certain characteristics of NoSQL databases, reasons enough as to why we need to use NoSQL databases. NoSQL data modeling techniques are different, though at places similar, to SQL data modeling techniques, hence some of the NoSQL data modeling techniques have been covered. Some of the features and examples of the various types of NoSQL databases are explained to sum it up.","authors":["Kaustav Ghosh","Asoke Nath"],"meta":["September 2016International Journal of Advance Research in Computer Science and Management Volume 4(8):203-221"],"references":[]}
