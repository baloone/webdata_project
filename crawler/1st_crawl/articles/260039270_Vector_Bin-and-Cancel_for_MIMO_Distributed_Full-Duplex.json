{"id":"260039270_Vector_Bin-and-Cancel_for_MIMO_Distributed_Full-Duplex","abstract":"In this paper, we study a three-node multi-input multi-output (MIMO) network,\nwhere an in- band full-duplex infrastructure node is communicating with two\nhalf-duplex mobiles, by supporting simultaneous up- and downlink\ncommunications. We study the impact of inter-node interference on system\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT), when the uplink transmission causes\ninterference to the downlink reception. We quantify how an out-of-band\nside-channel between mobile nodes can be used to improve the DMT for slow\nfading channels. Specifically, we characterize the required bandwidth of the\nside-channels, as a function of the antenna resources at different nodes, which\ncan achieve the DMT of a network with no inter-node interference. The insights\ngained from the DMT analysis reveal the tradeoff between spatial resources from\nmultiple antennas and spectral resources of the side-channels. The key to the\noptimal performance is a vector bin-and-cancel strategy leveraging\nHan-Kobayashi message splitting, which is shown to achieve the three-node\nnetwork capacity to within a constant approximation.","authors":["Jingwen Bai","Chris Dick","Ashutosh Sabharwal"],"meta":["August 2017EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2017(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13638-017-0919-y","SourcearXiv","Project: Massive MIMO Full-duplex"],"references":["266660532_Increasing_cellular_capacity_using_ISM_band_side-channels_a_first_study","259211639_Matrix-Monotonic_Optimization_for_MIMO_Systems","258247343_In-Band_Full-Duplex_Wireless_Challenges_and_Opportunities","236274573_Massive_MIMO_for_Next_Generation_Wireless_Systems","235432173_Passive_Self-Interference_Suppression_for_Full-Duplex_InfrastructureNodes","234772650_Cellular_traffic_offloading_through_opportunistic_communications_A_case_study","233967314_Distributed_Full-Duplex_via_Wireless_Side-Channels_Bounds_and_Protocols","261319966_Decode-and-cancel_for_interference_cancellation_in_a_three-node_full-duplex_network","260303037_The_Capacity_Region_of_the_MIMO_Interference_Channel_and_Its_Reciprocity_to_Within_a_Constant_Gap","260302340_The_Generalized_Degrees_of_Freedom_Region_of_the_MIMO_Interference_Channel_and_Its_Achievability"]}
