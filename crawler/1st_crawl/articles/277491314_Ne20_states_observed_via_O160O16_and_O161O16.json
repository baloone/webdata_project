{"id":"277491314_Ne20_states_observed_via_O160O16_and_O161O16","abstract":"Resonant energies, widths, strengths, spins, and parities are deduced for a total of 56 compound nuclear levels in Ne20 (16.4≤Ex≤21.1 MeV) using α+O16 elastic and inelastic scattering data. Writing the reaction amplitude for spinless positive-parity particles as a nonresonant term plus a sum over resonant partial waves permitted fitting the data at up to 20 angles. The procedure works effectively on regions at least up to 1.4 MeV wide and containing up to 15 resonances. Forty-one levels appear in the elastic scattering channel, while 11 are visible in the inelastic scattering to the first excited state in O16 (Ex=6.05 MeV). Four levels appear in both channels. Sixteen of these levels have not been reported previously.","authors":["Steven R.
