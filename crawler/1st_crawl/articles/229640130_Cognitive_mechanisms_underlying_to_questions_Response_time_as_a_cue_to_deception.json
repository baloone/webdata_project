{"id":"229640130_Cognitive_mechanisms_underlying_to_questions_Response_time_as_a_cue_to_deception","abstract":"In this article, a model of the cognitive processes involved in generating deceptive answers to questions is proposed. Partly based on recent accounts of discourse processing, it posits two central processes. One is the decision to lie followed by the construction of a lie. Each should add to response time compared to answering honestly. In Experiment 1, the construction component was assessed; 92 adults were randomly assigned to one of two conditions where they answered personal questions either deceptively or truthfully. Constructing a lie added reliably to response time. Think-aloud and correlational data support features of the model. In Experiment 2, 121 adults were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: either to tell the truth, lie, or lie when asked a question that probed sensitive information. Replicating and extending Experiment 1, the decision to lie added reliably to response time in the case of open-ended questions (questions that elicit more than two possible answers). Based on between- and within-subjects comparisons, results suggest that response time is a cue to deception. Recommendations are made for future research.
