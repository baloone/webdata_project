{"id":"310595148_Dependent_Types_for_Extensive_Games","abstract":"Extensive games are tools largely used in economics to describe decision processes of a community of agents. In this paper we propose a formal presentation based on the proof assistant Coq which focuses mostly on infinite extensive games and their characteristics. Coq proposes a features called \"dependent types\" , which means that the type of an object may depend on the type of its components. For instance, the set of choices of an agent may depend on the agent herself. Using dependent types, we describe formally a very general class of games and strategy profiles, which corresponds to what game theorists are used to. We also discuss the notions of infiniteness in game theory and how this can be precisely described.","authors":["Pierre Lescanne"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Formalized Reasoning 11(1)","DOI:10.6092/issn.1972-5787/7517","Project: Games and escalation"],"references":["326026573_Compositional_Game_Theory","262356476_Handcrafted_Inversions_Made_Operational_on_Operational_Semantics","260954797_Common_Knowledge_Logic_in_a_Higher_Order_Proof_Assistant","257380217_''Backward''_Coinduction_Nash_equilibrium_and_the_Rationality_of_Escalation","243785064_The_Dollar_Auction_Game_A_Paradox_in_Noncooperative_Behavior_and_Escalation","324396684_Game_Theory","319394003_EPUB_---_Wikipedia_The_Free_Encyclopedia","301852737_On_the_Rationality_of_Escalation","273085330_Game_Theory_A_Critical_Introduction","246285773_Game_Theory_A_Critical_Introduction"]}
