{"id":"343151224_RNR_A_Generic_Bayesian-based_Framework_for_Enhancing_Top-N_Recommender_Systems","abstract":"In personalized top-N recommender systems, a core task is to design effective methods to measure user-item preference scores and then to suggest, for each user, a small set of person-alized items with high scores. However, little attention was paid to the recommendation of low-score user-item links. In this work, based on the Bayesian estimation theory, we propose a novel metric RNR (Recall-to-Noise Ratio) to characterize the ability to recommend both high-score and low-score user-item links. Totally, there are three contributions in our work: * We propose a generic framework that leverages RNR to transfer the link scores of the state-of-the-art recommendation methods. * Besides,the RNR function could be efficiently calculated only by counting the score difference of existing and non-existing links, which does not improve the time complexity of the classical methods. * Empirical experiments show that the proposed framework could optimally improve the recommendation accuracy.","authors":["Rong-Qin Xu","Mingyang Zhou","Hao Liao"],"meta":["July 2020","DOI:10.1145/3366424","Conference: The Web Conference 2020At: Taipei, Taiwan","Project: NSF, China"],"references":["262219034_FISM_factored_item_similarity_models_for_top-N_recommender_systems","221141030_Performance_of_recommender_algorithms_on_top-N_recommendation_tasks","215721831_The_Relationship_Between_Precision-Recall_and_ROC_Curves","333076013_Improving_Top-K_Recommendation_via_JointCollaborative_Autoencoders","326141524_Adversarial_Personalized_Ranking_for_Recommendation","324514515_Variational_Autoencoders_for_Collaborative_Filtering","274903035_Recommender_System_Application_Developments_A_Survey"]}
