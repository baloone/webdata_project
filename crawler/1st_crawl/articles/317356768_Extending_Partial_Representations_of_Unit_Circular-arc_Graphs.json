(2011), generalizes the recognition problem. In this short note we show that this problem is NP-complete for unit circular-arc graphs.","authors":["Peter Zeman"],"meta":["June 2017"],"references":["256477000_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Circle_Graphs","230570052_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Proper_and_Unit_Interval_Graphs","224871696_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Function_Graphs_and_Permutation_Graphs","311508101_The_Partial_Visibility_Representation_Extension_Problem","305627349_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Interval_Graphs","295261668_Contact_Representations_of_Planar_Graphs_Extending_a_Partial_Representation_is_Hard","228095942_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Subclasses_of_Chordal_Graphs","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms","220617353_Complexity_Results_for_Multiprocessor_Scheduling_Under_Resource_Constraints","38346920_Incidence_Matrices_and_Interval_Graphs"]}
