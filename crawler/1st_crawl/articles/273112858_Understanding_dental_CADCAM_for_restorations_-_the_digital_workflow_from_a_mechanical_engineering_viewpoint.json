{"id":"273112858_Understanding_dental_CADCAM_for_restorations_-_the_digital_workflow_from_a_mechanical_engineering_viewpoint","abstract":"As digital technology infiltrates every area of daily life, including the field of medicine, so it is increasingly being introduced into dental practice. Apart from chairside practice, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) solutions are available for creating inlays, crowns, fixed partial dentures (FPDs), implant abutments, and other dental prostheses. CAD/CAM dental solutions can be considered a chain of digital devices and software for the almost automatic design and creation of dental restorations. However, dentists who want to use the technology often do not have the time or knowledge to understand it. A basic knowledge of the CAD/CAM digital workflow for dental restorations can help dentists to grasp the technology and purchase a CAM/CAM system that meets the needs of their office. This article provides a computer-science and mechanical-engineering approach to the CAD/CAM digital workflow to help dentists understand the technology.","authors":["Laurent Tapie","Nicolas Lebon","Kwamivi Bernardin Mawussi","Helene Fron Chabouis"],"meta":["April 2015International Journal of Computerized Dentistry 18:21-44","Project: Assesment and Development of CAD/CAM for restorative dentistry"],"references":["261624157_Computer-aided_Framework_Design_for_Digital_Dentistry","256903375_An_experimental_analysis_of_process_parameters_to_manufacture_by_milling_micro-channels_in_biomaterials","256288255_Computerized_technology_for_restorative_dentistry","51836518_The_Future_of_Dental_Devices_is_Digital","24195878_A_review_of_dental_CADCAM_Current_status_and_future_perspectives_from_20_years_of_experience","5381340_Digital_dentistry_An_overview_of_recent_developments_for_CADCAM_generated_restorations","310476682_Recent_development_in_CNC_machining_of_freeform_surfaces_a_state-of-the-art_review","305261215_Origins_of_the_APT_language_for_Automatically_Programmed_Tools","299696219_Collision_Free_Design_of_Dental_Prosthesis","298558066_Why_integration_is_key_for_dental_office_technology","272103853_Surface_Integrity_and_Cutting_Temperature_in_Machining_of_Biomedical_Magnesium_Alloys_an_Overview","272026786_Reverse_Engineering_A_Industrial_Perspective","266469726_CADCAM_Computer-aided_design_and_manufacturing","251551410_Surface_Integrity_in_Material_Removal_Processes_Recent_Advances","243472030_Initial_graphics_exchange_specification_iges_version_1_0","240600894_Encyclopedia_of_Computer_Science_and_Technology","239000679_An_Introduction_to_NURBS_with_Historical_Perspective","234780267_Integrating_Advanced_Computer-Aided_Design_Manufacturing_and_Numerical_Control_Principles_and_Implementations","234777164_Origins_of_the_APT_language_for_automatically_programmed_tools","232652204_Integrating_the_concept_of_reverse_engineering_in_medical_applications","229344257_Multi-beam_laser_probe_for_measuring_position_and_orientation_of_freeform_surface","228017092_Geometric_Modeling_for_Engineering_Applications","225811623_The_feature-based_posterior_crown_design_in_a_dental_CADCAM_system","222553626_Recent_development_in_CNC_machining_of_freeform_surfaces_A_state-of-the-art_review","220694079_The_Nurbs_Book","220584079_A_novel_3D_morphing_approach_for_tooth_occlusal_surface_reconstruction","220583280_A_foundation_for_interoperability_in_next-generation_product_development_systems","220506705_Dental_Inlay_and_Onlay_Construction_by_Iterative_Laplacian_Surface_Editing","220381428_A_review_of_machining_feature_recognition_methodologies","37446261_An_Introduction_to_NURBS_with_Historical_Perspective_David_F_Rogers","26289480_A_downloadable_meshed_human_canine_tooth_model_with_PDL_and_bone_for_finite_element_simulations","23314070_3D_surface_imaging_in_dentistry_-_What_we_are_looking_at","8182822_Why_integration_is_key_for_dental_office_technology","7847919_New_procedure_for_fully_automatic_occlusal_surface_reconstruction_by_means_of_a_biogeneric_tooth_model","7696250_Biogeneric_tooth_A_new_mathematical_representation_for_tooth_morphology_in_lower_first_molars","6875501_Use_of_CADCAM_technology_to_fabricate_a_removable_partial_denture_framework","6523017_Interactive_Tooth_Segmentation_of_Dental_Models"]}
