{"id":"318581985_New_Frontiers_in_Analyzing_Dynamic_Group_Interactions_Bridging_Social_and_Computer_Science","abstract":"This special issue on advancing interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and social scientists documents the joint results of the international Lorentz workshop, “Interdisciplinary Insights into Group and Team Dynamics,” which took place in Leiden, The Netherlands, July 2016. An equal number of scholars from social and computer science participated in the workshop and contributed to the papers included in this special issue. In this introduction, we first identify interaction dynamics as the core of group and team models and review how scholars in social and computer science have typically approached behavioral interactions in groups and teams. Next, we identify key challenges for interdisciplinary collaboration between social and computer scientists, and we provide an overview of the different articles in this special issue aimed at addressing these challenges.","authors":["Nale Lehmann-Willenbrock","Hayley Hung","Joann Keyton"],"meta":["October 2017Small Group Research 48(5):104649641771894","DOI:10.1177/1046496417718941"],"references":["294727858_Understanding_Positivity_Within_Dynamic_Team_Interactions_A_Statistical_Discourse_Analysis","275223620_Social_Sensing_for_Psychology_Automated_Interpersonal_Behavior_Assessment","275046100_Measuring_Team_Cohesion_Observations_from_the_Science","267502070_Automatic_Analysis_of_Facial_Affect_A_Survey_of_Registration_Representation_and_Recognition","313350668_Work_groups_and_teams_in_organizations","310819974_Alone_versus_In-a-group_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Facial_Affect_Recognition","283035765_Applying_sequence_methods_to_the_study_of_team_temporal_dynamics","283035647_Advancing_research_on_team_process_dynamics_Theoretical_methodological_and_measurement_considerations","281210166_Once_upon_a_time_Understanding_team_dynamics_as_relational_event_networks","271566481_Dynamics_in_Groups_Are_We_There_Yet"]}
