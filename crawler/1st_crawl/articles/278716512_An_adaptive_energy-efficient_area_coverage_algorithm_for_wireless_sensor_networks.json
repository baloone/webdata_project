{"id":"278716512_An_adaptive_energy-efficient_area_coverage_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","abstract":"The connected dominating set (CDS) concept has recently emerged as a promising approach to the area coverage in wireless sensor network (WSN). However, the major problem affecting the performance of the existing CDS-based coverage protocols is that they aim at maximizing the number of sleep nodes to save more energy. This places a heavy load on the active sensors (dominators) for handling a large number of neighbors. The rapid exhaustion of the active sensors may disconnect the network topology and leave the area uncovered. Therefore, to make a good trade-off between the network connectivity, coverage, and lifetime, a proper number of sensors must be activated. This paper presents a degree-constrained minimum-weight extension of the CDS problem called DCDS to model the area coverage in WSNs. The proper choice of the degree-constraint of DCDS balances the network load on the active sensors and significantly improves the network coverage and lifetime. A learning automata-based heuristic named as LAEEC is proposed for finding a near optimal solution to the proxy equivalent DCDS problem in WSN. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm to find a 1/1-Îµ optimal solution of the area coverage problem is approximated. Several simulation experiments are conducted to show the superiority of the proposed area coverage protocol over the existing CDS-based methods in terms of the control message overhead, percentage of covered area, residual energy, number of active nodes (CDS size), and network lifetime.","authors":["Dr. Javad Akbari Torkestani"],"meta":["August 2013Ad Hoc Networks 11(6):1655-1666","DOI:10.1016/j.adhoc.2013.03.002"],"references":["220294994_Wu_J_An_Extended_Localized_Algorithm_for_Connected_Dominating_Set_Formation_in_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks_IEEE_Trans_Parallel_and_Distributed_Systems_1510_908-920","220294152_Energy_Efficient_Protocol_for_Deterministic_and_Probabilistic_Coverage_in_Sensor_Networks","3436637_On_the_Path_Coverage_Properties_of_Random_Sensor_Networks","3300736_Geometric_spanners_for_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","2927340_A_New_Heuristic_For_The_Minimum_Connected_Dominating_Set_Problem_On_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks","278704192_An_adaptive_focused_Web_crawling_algorithm_based_on_learning_automata","264580191_Learning_automata_with_changing_number_of_actions_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_SMG171095-1100","263144513_A_new_distributed_job_scheduling_algorithm_for_grid_systems","262362104_Degree_constrained_minimum_spanning_tree_problem_A_learning_automata_approach","257675873_Mobility-Based_Backbone_Formation_in_Wireless_Mobile_Ad-hoc_Networks","257675221_LAAP_A_Learning_Automata-based_Adaptive_Polling_Scheme_for_Clustered_Wireless_Ad-Hoc_Networks","257582193_An_energy-efficient_topology_construction_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","257580573_An_adaptive_learning_automata-based_ranking_function_discovery_algorithm","257548571_A_new_approach_to_the_job_scheduling_problem_in_computational_grids","257489282_Mobility_prediction_in_mobile_wireless_networks","257489162_A_distributed_resource_discovery_algorithm_for_P2P_grids","257432373_An_adaptive_heuristic_to_the_bounded-diameter_minimum_spanning_tree_problem","257347175_Backbone_formation_in_wireless_sensor_networks","257016116_An_adaptive_learning_to_rank_algorithm_Learning_automata_approach","256942108_An_adaptive_backbone_formation_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","256721034_Finding_minimum_weight_connected_dominating_set_in_stochastic_graph_based_on_learning_automata","224071752_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","222935315_A_survey_of_movement_strategies_for_improving_network_coverage_in_wireless_sensor_networks","222513995_Coverage_and_Connectivity_Issues_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220799016_Convex_Combination_Approximation_for_the_Min-Cost_WSN_Point_Coverage_Problem","220679514_Computational_Complexity_of_Art_Gallery_Problems","220627182_On_coverage_issues_in_directional_sensor_networks_A_survey","220358829_Connectivity_and_coverage_maintenance_in_wireless_sensor_networks","220331329_Centralized_and_Clustered_k-Coverage_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220211997_Connectivity_preserving_localized_coverage_algorithm_for_area_monitoring_using_wireless_sensor_networks","220210523_Energy-efficient_coverage_problems_in_wireless_ad-hoc_sensor_networks","220201440_Boundary_coverage_coverage_boundary_problems_in_wireless_sensor_networks","220173021_A_survey_on_coverage_and_connectivity_issues_in_wireless_sensor_networks","220172560_A1_An_energy_efficient_topology_control_algorithm_for_connected_area_coverage_in_wireless_sensor_networks","220172472_A_family_of_simple_distributed_minimum_connected_dominating_set-based_topology_construction_algorithms","3201895_Coverage_opportunities_for_global_ocean_color_in_a_multimission_era","2490815_Relay_Sensor_Placement_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"]}
