{"id":"45931738_Optimally_swimming_Stokesian_robots","abstract":"We study self propelled stokesian robots composed of assemblies of balls, in\ndimensions 2 and 3, and prove that they are able to control their position and\norientation. This is a result of controllability, and its proof relies on\napplying Chow's theorem in an analytic framework, similarly to what has been\ndone in [3] for an axisymmetric system swimming along the axis of symmetry.\nHowever, we simplify drastically the analyticity result given in [3] and apply\nit to a situation where more complex swimmers move either in a plane or in\nthree-dimensional space, hence experiencing also rotations. We then focus our\nattention on energetically optimal strokes, which we are able to compute\nnumerically. Some examples of computed optimal strokes are discussed in detail.","authors":["Fran√ßois Alouges","Antonio Desimone","Luca Heltai","Aline Lefebvre"],"meta":["July 2010Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems - Series B 18(5)","DOI:10.3934/dcdsb.2013.18.1189","SourcearXiv"],"references":["255616597_A_Control_Theoretic_Approach_to_the_Swimming_of_Microscopic_Organisms","252874147_Impulsive_control_of_Lagrangian_systems_and_locomotion_in_fluids","314406506_Problems_and_Progress_in_Microswimming","299420197_Analysis_of_the_swimming_of_microscopic_organisms","281203206_Life_at_Low_Reynolds_Number","278136933_Local_controllability_for_a_swimming_model","265366203_Geometric_Control_Theory","261259045_Local_Controllability_for_a_Swimming_Model","255384271_Biological_Fluid_Dynamics_Non-linear_Partial_Differential_Equations","245371891_Practical_Guide_to_Boundary_Element_Methods_with_the_Software_Library_BEMLIB"]}
