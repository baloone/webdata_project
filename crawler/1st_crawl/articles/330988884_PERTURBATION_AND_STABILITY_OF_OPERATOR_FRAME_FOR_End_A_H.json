{"id":"330988884_PERTURBATION_AND_STABILITY_OF_OPERATOR_FRAME_FOR_End_A_H","abstract":"Frame theory is recently an active research area in mathematics , computer science, and engineering with many exciting applications in a variety of different fields. In this paper, we firstly give a characterization of operator frame for End * A (H) and K-operator frames for End * A (H). Lastly we consider the stability of operator frame for End * A (H) and K-operator frames for End * A (H) under perturbation and we establish some results.","authors":["Rossafi Mohamed","Abdellatif Akhlidj"],"meta":["February 2019","Projects: Gabor Frames and Shift-invariant Spaces- Sur une extension des Frames aux A-modules de Hilbert"],"references":["356437579_-K-G-FRAMES_AND_THEIR_DUALS_FOR_HILBERT_A_-MODULES","280962359_Generalized_Frames_with_C-Valued_Bounds_and_their_Operator_Duals","266001922_-Frames_in_Hilbert_C_-modules","259819151_On_Frames_for_Countably_Generated_Hilbert_C-Modules","325540567_An_introduction_to_frames_and_riesz_bases","266549297_Frames_in_tensor_products_of_Hilbert_C_-modules","265329156_Inner_Product_Modules_Over_B_-Algebras","248786774_Modules_Over_Operator_Algebras","234155090_Frames_and_bases_of_subspaces_in_Hilbert_spaces","222435991_Oblique_dual_frames_and_shift-invariant_spaces"]}
