{"id":"321832248_Detection_of_Contextual_Identity_Links_in_a_Knowledge_Base","abstract":"Most of the Linked Data applications currently rely on the use of owl : sameAs for linking ontology instances. However, several studies have noticed multiple misuses of this identity link. These misuses, which are mainly caused by the lack of other well-defined linking alternatives, can lead to erroneous statements or inconsistencies. We propose in this paper a new contextual identity link: identiConTo that could serve as a replacement for owl : sameAs in linking identical instances in a specified context. To detect these contextual links, we have defined an algorithm named DECIDE that has been tested on scientific knowledge bases describing transformation processes.","authors":["Joe Raad","Nathalie Pernelle","Fatiha Sais"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1145/3148011.3148032","Conference: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Knowledge CaptureAt: Austin, TX, USA","Project: Identity Management in the Web of Data"],"references":["316075210_Logical_Detection_of_Invalid_SameAs_Statements_in_RDF_Data","312721287_Scientific_Lenses_to_Support_Multiple_Views_over_Linked_Chemistry_Data","303884143_Graph-FCA_in_Practice","288689912_Not_quite_the_same_Identity_constraints_for_the_Web_of_Linked_Data","313349066_URI_Disambiguation_in_the_Context_of_Linked_Data","309686253_PO2_-_A_Process_and_Observation_Ontology_in_Food_Science_Application_to_Dairy_Gels","303098352_A_Contextualised_Semantics_for_owlsameAs","300126250_When_owlsameAs_isn't_the_Same_Redux_Towards_a_Theory_of_Identity_Context_and_Inference_on_the_Semantic_Web","281396063_Discovering_and_maintaining_links_on_the_web_of_data","277171954_The_Identity_of_Indiscernibles"]}
