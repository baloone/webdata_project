This method opens the door for transparent, ultrathin, flexible, and low cost carbon‐nanoionics devices that can control not only electronic transport, but also other properties such as photoluminescence and optics.","authors":["Takashi Tsuchiya","Kazuya Terabe","Masakazu Aono"],"meta":["February 2014Advanced Materials 26(7)","DOI:10.1002/adma.201304770"],"references":["235881779_Temperature_tuned_defect_induced_magnetism_in_reduced_graphene_oxide","234974683_Photoluminescence_and_Band_Gap_Modulation_in_Graphene_Oxide","231149595_Graphene_oxide_thin_film_field_effect_transistors_without_reduction","228445061_Chemically_modified_graphene_oxides_as_a_hole_transport_layer_in_organic_solar_cells","51427812_Large-area_ultrathin_films_of_reduced_graphene_oxide_as_a_transparent_and_flexible_electronic_material","50290049_New_Insights_into_the_Structure_and_Reduction_of_Graphite_Oxide","40028968_Liquid-gated_interface_superconductivity_on_an_atomically_flat_film","257955878_All-solid-state_electric-double-layer_transistor_based_on_oxide_ion_migration_in_Gd-doped_CeO2_on_SrTiO3_single_crystal","257005595_Water_uptake_and_conduction_property_of_nano-grained_yttria-doped_zirconia_fabricated_by_ultra-high_pressure_compaction_at_room_temperature","248842300_Room-temperature_protonic_conduction_in_nanocrystalline_films_of_yttria-stabilized_zirconia","244317780_Theoretical_X-ray_scattering_intensity_of_carbons_with_turbostratic_stacking_and_AB_staking_structures","243142943_Optical_Properties_of_Electronic_Structure_of_Amorphous_Germanium","239946348_Searching_for_Magnetism_in_Hydrogenated_Graphene_Using_Highly_Hydrogenated_Graphene_Prepared_via_Birch_Reduction_of_Graphite_Oxides","234280256_The_Optical_Propeties_of_Solids","229492971_High-Density_Carrier_Accumulation_in_ZnO_Field-Effect_Transistors_Gated_by_Electric_Double_Layers_of_Ionic_Liquids","228934859_Electrostatic_charge_accumulation_versus_electrochemical_doping_in_SrTiO_electric_double_layer_transistors","228638792_Supercapacitor_Devices_Based_on_Graphene_Materials","225042403_Tunable_Photoluminescence_from_Graphene_Oxide","222092544_Controlled_Stepwise_Reduction_and_Band_Gap_Manipulation_of_Graphene_Oxide","49635545_Graphene_oxide_as_a_chemically_tunable_platform_for_optical_applications","46094245_Influence_of_Disorder_on_Conductance_in_Bilayer_Graphene_under_Perpendicular_Electric_Field","45851976_Insulator_to_Semimetal_Transition_in_Graphene_Oxide","44576822_Increased_Tc_in_Electrolyte-Gated_Cuprates","44500330_Physics_of_Semiconductor_Devices_New_York","43074003_Chemical_Methods_for_the_Production_of_Graphenes","41850700_Blue_Photoluminescence_from_Chemically_Derived_Graphene_Oxide","24243772_Electrical_Conduction_Mechanism_in_Chemically_Derived_Graphene_Monolayers","23314087_Electric-field-induced_superconductivity_in_an_insulator","23230094_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_Molecular_Sensors","5789482_Gate-induced_insulating_state_in_bilayer_graphene_devices"]}
