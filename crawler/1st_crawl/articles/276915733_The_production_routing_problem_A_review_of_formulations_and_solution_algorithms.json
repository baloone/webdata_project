{"id":"276915733_The_production_routing_problem_A_review_of_formulations_and_solution_algorithms","abstract":"The production routing problem (PRP) combines the lot-sizing problem and the vehicle routing problem, two classical problems that have been extensively studied for more than half a century. The PRP is solved in an attempt to jointly optimize production, inventory, distribution and routing decisions and is thus a generalization of the inventory routing problem (IRP). Although the PRP has a complicated structure, there has been a growing interest in this problem during the past decade in both academia and industry. This article provides a comprehensive review of various solution techniques that have been proposed to solve the PRP. We attempt to provide an in-depth summary and discussion of different formulation schemes and of algorithmic and computational issues. Finally, we point out interesting research directions for further developments in production routing.","authors":["Yossiri Adulyasak","Jean-Fran√ßois Cordeau","Raf Jans"],"meta":["March 2015Computers & Operations Research 55(1):141-152","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2014.01.011"],"references":["286256258_Plant_location_Set_Covering_and_Economic_Lot_Size_An_0_mn-Algorithm_for_Structured_Problems","265668231_Accelerating_Benders_Decomposition_Algorithmic_Enhancement_and_Model_Selection_Criteria","263250210_On_the_Integrated_Production_Inventory_and_Distribution_Routing_Problem","262167903_Decomposition_of_a_Combined_Inventory_and_Time_Constrained_Ship_Routing_Problem","257596379_The_integrated_production-inventory-distribution-routing_problem","257153553_MIP_formulations_and_heuristics_for_two-level_production-transportation_problems","245280456_A_Dynamic_Distribution_Model_with_Warehouse_and_Customer_Replenishment_Requirements","236110092_The_Kellogg_Company_Optimizes_Production_Inventory_and_Distribution","233842272_A_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_the_Symmetric_Generalized_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","228578943_Robust_Inventory_Routing_Under_Demand_Uncertainty","225237245_Greedy_Randomized_Adaptive_Search_Procedures","225135001_Local_branching","220693571_Tabu_search_I","220589093_Projection_Results_for_Vehicle_Routing","303170286_Computer_solutions_of_the_traveling_salesman_problem","285484645_The_vehicle_routing_problem","284651802_Interfaces_in_Computer_Science_and_Operations_Research","270673483_Formulations_and_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithms_for_Multivehicle_Production_and_Inventory_Routing_Problems","270396557_Thirty_Years_of_Inventory_Routing","266415650_Optimization-Based_Adaptive_Large_Neighborhood_Search_for_the_Production_Routing_Problem","265332087_A_genetic_algorithm_approach_to_the_integrated_inventory-distribution_problem","264995999_A_Relaxation_Based_Solution_Approach_for_the_Inventory_Control_and_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_in_Vendor_Managed_Systems","264957737_The_Reactive_Tabu_Search","257429749_Consistency_in_multi-vehicle_inventory-routing","257153672_The_exact_solution_of_several_classes_of_inventory-routing_problems","257153640_Tabu_search_with_path_relinking_for_an_integrated_production-distribution_problem","257153538_The_inventory-routing_problem_with_transshipment","247578396_Solving_the_Traveling-Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows_Using_Tabu_Search","245315717_A_dynamic_lot_sizing_problem_with_multiple_customers_Customer-specific_shipping_and_backlogging_costs","245310427_Fast_heuristics_for_a_combined_production_planning_and_vehicle_routing_problem","242932154_Solving_Multi-Item_Capacitated_Lot-Sizing_Problems_Using_Variable_Redefinition","241738930_Time-Partitioning_Heuristics_Application_to_One_Warehouse_Multiitem_Multiretailer_Lot-Sizing_Problems","236110103_Solving_An_Integrated_Logistics_Problem_Arising_In_Grocery_Distribution","234126233_A_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_Using_a_StrongFormulation_and_an_A_Priori_Tour-BasedHeuristic_for_an_Inventory-Routing_Problem","227716033_The_Dynamic_Transshipment_Problem","225121508_The_one-warehouse_multi-retailer_problem_Reformulation_classification_and_computational_results","223648020_Industrial_aspects_and_literature_survey_Combined_inventory_management_and_routing","223402902_Multi-product_lot-sizing_with_a_transportation_capacity_reservation_contract","222815615_Inventory_routing_with_continuous_moves","222650379_An_optimization_algoritm_for_the_inventory_routing_problem_with_continuous_moves","222559812_A_Lagrangean_relaxation_algorithm_for_multi-item_lot-sizing_problems_with_joint_piecewise_linear_resource_costs","222519051_An_integrated_model_of_the_periodic_delivery_problems_for_vending-machine_supply_chains","222476403_Coordination_of_production_and_distribution_planning","222436659_MAPM_Memetic_algorithms_with_population_management","222416214_A_heuristic_algorithm_for_a_multi-product_dynamic_lot-sizing_and_shipping_problem","222141570_A_branch-and-price_algorithm_for_an_integrated_production_and_inventory_routing_problem","222087022_Heuristics_for_a_multiperiod_inventory_routing_problem_with_production_decisions","221704675_Improving_the_Distribution_of_Industrial_Gases_with_an_On-Line_Computerized_Routing_and_Scheduling_Optimizer","220472219_A_reactive_GRASP_and_path_relinking_for_a_combined_production-distribution_problem","220471404_Analysis_of_the_maximum_level_policy_in_a_production-distribution_system","220413352_A_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_a_Vendor-Managed_Inventory-Routing_Problem","220413334_An_Adaptive_Large_Neighborhood_Search_Heuristic_for_the_Pickup_and_Delivery_Problem_with_Time_Windows","220413118_A_Decomposition_Approach_for_the_Inventory-Routing_Problem","220432537_Integer_Programming_Formulation_of_Traveling_Salesman_Problems","220413280_Synchronized_Development_of_Production_Inventory_and_Distribution_Schedules"]}
