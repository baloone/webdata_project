{"id":"250198785_Interdisciplinary_dynamics_of_modern_science_Analysis_of_cross-disciplinary_citation_flows","abstract":"The references in research papers provide empirical data on knowledge flows within and between scientific disciplines. Many\ncitations refer to papers that are published in scientific journals covering adjacent scientific disciplines. We have used\nthis information source to explore — at the global level — the extent to which disciplines are interrelated through these\ncross-disciplinary citation links. In this paper we describe the main features of the bibliometric methodology. The first\nresults of this study provide new macro-level data on the interdisciplinarity of modern science and identify a few disciplines,\nsuch as meteorology and atmospheric sciences, in which research has become noticeably more interdisciplinary.","authors":["Thed Van Leeuwen","Robert Tijssen"],"meta":["December 2000Research Evaluation 9(3):183-187","DOI:10.3152/147154400781777241"],"references":["285800144_The_interdisciplinary_nature_of_science_Theoretical_framework_and_bibliometric-empirical_approach","245344297_An_indicator_of_cross-disciplinary_research","242916171_Nanotechnology_-_Interdisciplinarity_patterns_of_collaboration_and_differences_in_application","242916243_Measuring_interdisciplinary_collaboration_within_a_university_The_effects_of_the_Multidisciplinary_Research_Programme","242896004_Interdisciplinary_Research_From_Belief_to_Reality","242880035_Interdisciplinary_research_being_stifled'","228108178_Citation_Analysis_As_A_Tool_in_Journal_Evaluation_-_Journals_Can_be_Ranked_by_Frequency_and_Impact_of_Citations_for_Science_Policy_Studies","225199260_Out_of_particles_Impact_of_CERN_DESY_and_SLAC_research_to_fields_other_than_physics","225147882_Neural_networks_research_in_context_A_longitudinal_journal_cocitation_analysis_of_an_emerging_interdisciplinary_field","220435107_Structures_and_Strategies_of_Interdisciplinary_Science"]}
