{"id":"318813958_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Sets_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Diameter","abstract":"The Near-Bipartiteness problem is that of deciding whether or not the vertices of a graph can be partitioned into sets $A$ and $B$, where $A$ is an independent set and $B$ induces a forest. The set $A$ in such a partition is said to be an independent feedback vertex set. Yang and Yuan proved that Near-Bipartiteness is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter 2 and NP-complete for graphs of diameter 4. We show that Near-Bipartiteness is NP-complete for graphs of diameter 3, resolving their open problem. We also generalise their result for diameter 2 by proving that even the problem of computing a minimum independent feedback vertex is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter 2.","authors":["Marthe Bonamy","Konrad Kazimierz Dabrowski","Carl Feghali","Matthew Johnson"],"meta":["July 2017Information Processing Letters 131(12)","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2017.11.004"],"references":["318813787_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Set_for_P_5-Free_Graphs","230595992_Polynomial_Algorithms_for_Perfect_Graphs","222174279_The_complexity_of_some_problems_related_to_Graph_3-colorability","221666416_Algorithms_and_Almost_Tight_Results_for_3-Colorability_of_Small_DiameterGraphs","318540153_Partitioning_a_triangle-free_planar_graph_into_a_forest_and_a_forest_of_bounded_degree","305873217_Open_Problems_on_Graph_Coloring_for_Special_Graph_Classes","277976289_Algorithms_for_the_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem","257145241_Cycle_transversals_in_perfect_graphs_and_cographs","245811966_Coverings_and_coloring_of_hypergraphs","220266597_Three_Complexity_Results_on_Coloring"]}
