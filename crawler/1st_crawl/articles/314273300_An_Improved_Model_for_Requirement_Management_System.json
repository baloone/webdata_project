{"id":"314273300_An_Improved_Model_for_Requirement_Management_System","abstract":"Requirement engineering is the most important part of the modern software engineering, which evolved over decades and become a science. It probably plays the most vital part in success of the software system. The requirements management world has developed considerably in the last decade and has increasingly become one of the bases of successful software and systems engineering projects. Managing requirements is not an easy task; in order to record good requirements and manage the changes afterwards is the trickiest part. Many researchers around the world have worked on optimization of the requirement management process. In this paper we propose a model which is and improved version of the model by Nathan W Mogk. To overcome the limitations of that model we proposed a comprehensive model with focus on the limitation of this model and provide an enhanced model. This paper is the extension of the requirements management system based on an optimization model of the design process.","authors":["Hafeez MS","Farhan Rasheed","Khan MR"],"meta":["January 2017Journal of Information Technology & Software Engineering 07(01)","DOI:10.4172/2165-7866.1000196"],"references":["260914463_A_Requirements_Management_System_based_on_an_Optimization_Model_of_the_Design_Process","254952636_IRIS-TS_DETECTING_INTERACTIONS_BETWEEN_REQUIREMENTS_IN_DOORS","4091749_Requirements_Management_Tools","265807397_Requirements_traceability_A_systematic_review_and_industry_case_study","254023589_Guidelines_for_model_based_systems_engineering","243517256_Adaptive_Software_Development_A_Collaborative_Approach_to_Managing_Complex_Systems"]}
