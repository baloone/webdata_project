{"id":"233426656_Horizontal_transport_affecting_trace_gas_seasonality_in_the_Tropical_Tropopause_Layer_TTL","abstract":"We analyze horizontal transport from midlatitudes into the tropics\n(in-mixing) and its impact on seasonal variations of ozone, carbon\nmonoxide and water vapor in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). For\nthis purpose, we use three-dimensional backward trajectories, driven by\nECMWF ERA-Interim winds, and a conceptual one-dimensional model of the\nchemical composition of the TTL. We find that the fraction of in-mixed\nmidlatitude air shows an annual cycle with maximum during NH summer,\nresulting from the superposition of two inversely phased annual cycles\nfor in-mixing from the NH and SH, respectively. In-mixing is driven by\nthe monsoonal upper-level anticyclonic circulations. This circulation\npattern is dominated by the Southeast Asian summer monsoon and,\ncorrespondingly, in-mixing shows an annual cycle. The impact of\nin-mixing on TTL mixing ratios depends on the in-mixed fraction of\nmidlatitude air and on the meridional gradient of the particular\nspecies. For CO the meridional gradient and consequently the effect of\nin-mixing is weak. For water vapor, in-mixing effects are negligible.\nFor ozone, the meridional gradient is large and the contribution of\nin-mixing to the ozone maximum during NH summer is about 50%. This\nin-mixing contribution is not sensitive to the tropical ascent velocity,\nwhich is about 40% too fast in ERA-Interim. As photochemically produced\nozone in the TTL shows no distinct summer maximum, the ozone annual\nanomaly in the upper TTL turns out to be mainly forced by in-mixing of\nozone-rich extratropical air during NH summer.","authors":["Felix Ploeger","P.
