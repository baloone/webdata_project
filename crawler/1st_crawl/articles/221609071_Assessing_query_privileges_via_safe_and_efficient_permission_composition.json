{"id":"221609071_Assessing_query_privileges_via_safe_and_efficient_permission_composition","abstract":"We propose an approach for the selective enforcement of ac- cess control restrictions in, possibly distributed, large data collections based on two basic concepts: i) âˆžexible autho- rizations identify, in a declarative way, the data that can be released, and ii) queries are checked for execution not with respect to individual authorizations but rather evaluating whether the information release they (directly or indirectly) entail is allowed by the authorizations. Our solution is based on the deflnition of query proflles capturing the information content of a query and builds on a graph-based modeling of database schema, authorizations, and queries. Access con- trol is then efiectively modeled and e-ciently executed in terms of graph coloring and composition and on traversal of graph paths. We then provide a polynomial composition algorithm for determining if a query is authorized.","authors":["Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati","Sara Foresti","Sushil Jajodia","Stefano Paraboschi"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1145/1455770.1455810","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, CCS 2008, Alexandria, Virginia, USA, October 27-31, 2008"],"references":["221322300_Privacy_in_GLAV_Information_Integration","221213973_Query_Optimization_in_the_Presence_of_Limited_Access_Patterns","220841963_View_security_as_the_basis_for_data_warehouse_security","220432096_A_Proof_Procedure_for_Data_Dependencies","2367921_Administering_Permissions_for_Distributed_Data_Factoring_and_Automated_Inference","225913374_Computing_complete_answers_to_queries_in_the_presence_of_limited_access_patterns","223874089_Maximizing_Sharing_of_Protected_Information","222536726_Rewriting_queries_using_views_with_access_patterns_under_integrity_constraints","221559415_Computing_cores_for_data_exchange_New_algorithms_and_practical_solutions","221214739_Extending_Query_Rewriting_Techniques_for_Fine-Grained_Access_Control","220967331_Querying_Data_under_Access_Limitations","220688578_Database_Systems_-_Concepts_Languages_and_Architectures","220225715_The_Theory_of_Joins_in_Relational_Databases","220225292_Testing_Implications_of_Data_Dependencies","200034273_Data_exchange_Computing_Cores_in_Polynomial_Time","4365085_Controlled_Information_Sharing_in_Collaborative_Distributed_Query_Processing","3499966_An_access_authorization_model_for_relational_databases_based_on_algebraic_manipulation_of_view_definitions"]}
