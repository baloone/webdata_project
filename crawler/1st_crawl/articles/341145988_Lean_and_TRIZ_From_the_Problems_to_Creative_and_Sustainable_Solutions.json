{"id":"341145988_Lean_and_TRIZ_From_the_Problems_to_Creative_and_Sustainable_Solutions","abstract":"Lean Thinking philosophy pursuit continuous improvement and continuous innovation towards economic and eco-sustainable growth by new solutions. Such solutions involve eco-efficient products (goods and/or services) and cleaner production to produce them. Nevertheless, sometimes, there are technical contradictions that inhibited companies to achieve good solutions. TRIZ is a methodology capable to solve such contradictions and Lean could use it. Lean and TRIZ are on the road to achieve sustainable development goals, directly, the Goal 12, responsible consumption and production. This paper presents some case studies where this alliance is recognized and credited. These case studies were collected and synthetized by: type of work developed, company/sector, main TRIZ and Lean principles and tools used, problem(s) to solve and products/solutions designed. Building on the results, the authors systematized that Lean and TRIZ impact the design of creative solutions. Many of such solutions were developed in studentsâ€™ master dissertations that reveals the importance of teaching Lean allied with TRIZ.","authors":["Anabela C.
