{"id":"325725324_Smarter_and_more_connected_Future_intelligent_transportation_system","abstract":"Emerging technologies toward a connected vehicle-infrastructure-pedestrian environment and big data have made it easier and cheaper to collect, store, analyze, use, and disseminate multi-source data. The connected environment also introduces new approaches to flexible control and management of transportation systems in real time to improve overall system performance. Given the benefits of a connected environment, it is crucial that we understand how the current intelligent transportation system could be adapted to the connected environment.
