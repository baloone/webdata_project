{"id":"254462700_Fuzzy_OOP_Expanded_and_reduced_term_interpretations","abstract":"We display a novel perspective of novice OOP difficulties. In a thorough study of 120 undergraduates, in their first OOP course, we noticed a variety of misconceptions and difficulties with a wide range of basic terms and notions. Careful analysis revealed a recurring phenomenon, of fuzzy OOP conceptions, which derive from expansion and reduction of basic term features. Novices tended to expand and/or reduce properties not only of terms such as \"class\" and \"object\", but also of terms such as \"static\", \"access\", and \"instance\". Particular misconceptions were of the forms: \"One vs. Many\". We display a detailed categorization of our findings, in an ordered hierarchical structure, and discuss its cognitive characteristics.","authors":["Ronit Shmallo","Noa Ragonis","David Ginat"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.1145/2325296.2325368","Project: OOP - Learning and Teaching Object Oriented Programming"],"references":["221538349_Avoiding_object_misconceptions","221536843_Student_understanding_of_object-oriented_programming_as_expressed_in_concept_maps","220832185_My_Program_is_Correct_But_it_Doesn_t_Run_A_Preliminary_Investigation_of_Novice_Programmers_Problems","220808148_Checklists_for_grading_object-oriented_CS1_programs_concepts_and_misconceptions","220807323_Novice_Java_programmers'_conceptions_of_object_and_class_and_variation_theory","220807260_Identifying_Novice_Difficulties_in_Object_Orientated_Design","312915607_My_program_is_correct_but_it_doesn't_run_A_preliminary_investigation_of_novice_programmers'_problems","286586940_Static_vs_dynamic_issues_in_object-oriented_programming_languages","275436452_Checklists_for_grading_object-oriented_CS1_programs","274056621_Programming_in_Java","270416126_Conceptions_of_Human-Computer_Interaction_A_Model_for_Understanding_Student_Errors","247927487_The_same_but_different_Students'_understandings_of_primitive_and_object_variables","245760146_Concept_definition_concept_image_and_the_notion_of_function","231167919_Some_Difficulties_of_Learning_to_Program","231167898_Some_Difficulties_of_Learning_to_Program","228858563_A_long-term_investigation_of_the_comprehension_of_OOP_concepts_by_novices","221537075_Programming_in_Java_Student-constructed_rules","220807191_Relationship_between_text_and_action_conceptions_of_programming_A_phenomenographic_and_quantitative_perspective"]}
