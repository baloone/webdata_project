{"id":"221329680_The_Semantics_of_Simple_Language_for_Parallel_Programming","abstract":"In this paper, we describe a simple language for parallel programming. Its semantics is studied thoroughly. The de- sirable properties of this language and its deciencies are exhibited by this theoretical study. Basic results on parallel program schemata are given. We hope in this way to make a case for more formal (i.e. mathematical) approach to the design of languages for systems programming and the design of operating systems. There is a wide disagreement among systems designers as to what are the best primitives for writing systems programs. In this paper, we describe a simple language for parallel programming and study its mathematical properties.","authors":["Gilles Kahn"],"meta":["January 1974","SourceDBLP"],"references":[]}
