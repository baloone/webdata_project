{"id":"264946710_Varieties_and_Pseudovarieties_of_Ordered_Normal_Bands","abstract":"The structure of the lattice of varieties of bands was completely described, independently, by Birjukov, Fennemore and Gerhard. Bloom proved an analogue of the Birkhoff theorem for ordered algebras and Pin and Weil proved an analogue of Reitermanâ€™s theorem for finite ordered algebras.\nIn this paper we consider varieties of ordered bands and obtain a description of the lattice of varieties of ordered bands up to normal bands. We also show that this is isomorphic to the lattice of pseudovarieties of ordered normal bands.","authors":["Stephen J.
