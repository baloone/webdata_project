{"id":"327771549_An_approach_to_develop_the_smart_health_using_Internet_of_Things_and_authentication_based_on_biometric_technology","abstract":"Internet of things is a new pattern in wireless communications of things. The basic theory of IoT is the comprehensive presence of different kinds of things in surrounding environment. The three main dimensions of data security in the Internet are integration, privacy and availability. One of the major tools for maintaining the security of Internet medical things is biometric technology. Biometric systems are used in different fields of the smart healthcare. In this regard, we also need a means for identifying people's identity based on their physical characteristics; the use of biometric data is absolutely critical for IoT functions. Considering this emerging pattern, everything integrated will connect to a virtual chain of connected things with address in the dynamic world of networks. Given the importance of secure connections of things to the Internet and access to them, biometric features are used as identifiers; because they cannot be borrowed, bought, forgotten and they are very difficult to forge or copy. The smart healthcare and IoT resulted in the emergence of a new standard in the applications of biometric data. In this paper, we present a new standard for applying biometric technology to develop smart healthcare using IoT which includes high capacity to access data in addition to being easy to use. In this paper, we reached a more secure way of accessing IoT based on biometrics and fast identity standard by which we can expect significant advances in smart healthcare systems.","authors":["H.
