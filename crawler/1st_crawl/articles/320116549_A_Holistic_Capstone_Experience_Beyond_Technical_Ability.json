{"id":"320116549_A_Holistic_Capstone_Experience_Beyond_Technical_Ability","abstract":"This paper presents a two-semester capstone experience successfully employed over three years within a CS department of just four faculty members faced with growing enrollment. This year long capstone experience is a significant overhaul of an earlier capstone implementation that increases the breadth and depth of project topics. This restructuring facilitates a greater emphasis on research, planning, and soft skills that are typically not emphasized in computer science courses, while allowing enrollment growth. Assessment is based on the product and the software development process including research, planning, coding and communication to various audiences in written, visual and verbal forms. This new model more closely aligns the students' capstone experiences with skills necessary for a career in computer science while aligning with student outcomes laid out in our program design.","authors":["Andrew Scott","William Kreahling","Mark A.
