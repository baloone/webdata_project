{"id":"245125376_On_the_use_of_dual_numbers_vectors_and_matrices_in_instantaneous_spatial_kinematics","abstract":"This paper gives a self-contained account of the algebra of dual quantities, the differential-geometry of dual curves, and their application to theoretical space kinematics. The scope of the paper is mainly didactical, but its understanding by the reader requires a certain amount of mathematical maturity. Due to the way in which the matter is presented, the paper gives some formulae and facts about dual curves and dual motions which are not generally known.","authors":["GR Veldkamp"],"meta":["December 1976Mechanism and Machine Theory 11(2):141-156","DOI:10.1016/0094-114X(76)90006-9"],"references":["241391206_Closure_to_Discussions_of_Application_of_Dual-Number_Quaternion_Algebra_to_the_Analysis_of_Spatial_Mechanisms'''_1965_ASME_J_Appl_Mech_32_pp_221-223","227087589_Analyse_und_Synthese_der_Raumkurbelgetriebe_mittels_Raumliniengeometrie_und_dualer_Grossen"]}
