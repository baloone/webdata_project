{"id":"220155666_Predictable_semiautomata","abstract":"We introduce a new class of nondeterministic semiautomata: A nondeterministic semiautomaton S is predictable if there exists k≥0 such that, if S knows the current input a and the next k inputs, the transition under a can be made deterministically. Nondeterminism may occur only when the length of the unread input is ≤k. We develop a theory of predictable semiautomata. We show that, if a semiautomaton with n states is k-predictable, but not (k−1)-predictable, then k≤(n2−n)/2, and this bound can be reached for a suitable input alphabet. We characterize k-predictable semiautomata, and introduce the predictor semiautomaton, based on a look-ahead semiautomaton. The predictor is essentially deterministic and simulates a nondeterministic semiautomaton by finding the set of states reachable by a word w, if it belongs to the language L of the semiautomaton (i.e., if it defines a path from an initial state to some state), or by stopping as soon as it infers that w∉L. Membership in L can be decided deterministically.","authors":["Janusz Brzozowski","Nicolae Santean"],"meta":["August 2009Theoretical Computer Science 410(35):3236-3249","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2009.05.010","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226385112_Deterministic_Simulation_of_a_NFA_with_k-Symbol_Lookahead","221050722_Automated_composition_of_e-services_lookaheads","221050338_Automatic_Composition_of_E-services_That_Export_Their_Behavior","267142420_Algebraic_Theory_of_Automata","266256564_Theory_of_codes","263984706_INFIX-FREE_REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS_AND_LANGUAGES","249358015_Hysteretic_Behavior_of_Magnetorheological_Fluid_and_Identification_Using_Preisach_Model","221543840_Composability_of_Infinite-State_Activity_Automata","221512803_Deterministic_Simulation_of_a_NFA_with","220520505_Simple-Regular_Expressions_and_Languages"]}
