{"id":"230791944_Proposition_Algebra_and_Short-Circuit_Logic","abstract":"Short-circuit evaluation denotes the semantics of proposi- tional connectives in which the second argument is only evaluated if the first argument does not suffice to determine the value of the expression. In programming, short-circuit evaluation is widely used.\nWe review proposition algebra [2010], an algebraic approach to proposi- tional logic with side effects that models short-circuit evaluation. Propo- sition algebra is based on Hoare’s conditional [1985], which is a ternary connective comparable to if-then-else. Starting from McCarthy’s notion of sequential evaluation [1963] we discuss a number of valuation con- gruences on propositional statements and we introduce Hoare-McCarthy algebras as the structures that model these congruences. We also briefly discuss the associated short-circuit logics, i.e., the logics that define these congruences if one restricts to sequential binary connectives.","authors":["Jan Bergstra","Alban Ponse"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-29320-7_2","Conference: Fundamentals of Software Engineering (FSEN 2011)Volume: LNCS 7141"],"references":["234820363_Module_Algebra","220481302_Short-circuit_logic","48173388_On_Hoare-McCarthy_algebras","2402941_A_Propositional_Logic_With_4_Values_True_False_Divergent_and_Meaningless","268840656_A_couple_of_novelties_in_the_propositional_calculus","229580430_A_Couple_of_Novelties_in_the_Propositional_Calculus","220618074_Equational_Bases_for_If-Then-Else","220616893_Varieties_of_If-Then-Else","45881209_Instruction_sequence_processing_operators","38378074_Equational_Bases_of_Boolean_Algebras"]}
