{"id":"220140152_E-learning_as_innovation_Exploring_innovativeness_of_the_VET_teachers'_community_in_Estonia","abstract":"In this article, the acceptance of e-learning by teachers of vocational secondary and professional higher education institutions (hereafter: VET teachers) in Estonia has been analysed. The analysis is based on questionnaire study, carried out in 2007. The theoretical framework of the article has been inspired by Everett Rogers’ innovation diffusion theory. It appears that there exists a statistically reliable difference between innovators and the remaining adopter categories among VET teachers. One can see that in the context of the VET teachers’ working environment, a multi-dimensional innovation gap appears, embracing gaps in the actual use of e-learning tools, different types of skills and competences, access and support indicators. The model of innovativeness constructed shows that the competences are predictors of innovativeness. The development of competences related to e-learning (ICT competence, e-learning competence, pedagogical competence) and innovativeness are closely related. It will be argued that while one of the challenges for the developers of e-learning is to provide teachers with relevant continuous training as well as making efforts in developing existing support structures, we can assume that for different adopter categories among teachers different strategies and support schemes should be applied, as the values and attitudes of different groups vary.","authors":["Krista Loogma","Jüri Kruusvall","Meril Ümarik"],"meta":["February 2012Computers & Education 58(2):808-817","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.005","SourceDBLP"],"references":["312912897_Tutkimuksen_tekemisen_perusteet_ihmistieteissa","273698896_AJET_23_A_framework_for_analysing_ICT_adoption_in_Australian_primary_schools","220437882_Mapping_the_Terrain_of_Generation_C_Places_and_Practices_of_Online_Content_Creation_Among_Estonian_Teenagers","220374774_Logistic_Regression_Modeling_for_Predicting_Task-Related_ICT_Use_in_Teaching","44840241_Learning_about_System_Renewal","44838619_Pedagogy_and_ICT_use_in_schools_around_the_world_Findings_from_the_IEA_SITES_2006_study","288949034_Revolutsioon_mida_ei_toimunud_ehk_e-oppe_senised_tulemid","248803339_Inside_the_Tornado_Marketing_Strategies_from_Silicon_Valley's_Cutting_Edge","229067924_Crossing_the_Chasm_Marketing_and_Selling_High-Tech_Products_to_Mainstream_Customers","227267224_Study_Design_and_Methodology","227036489_National_Contexts","226870797_Teacher_Characteristics_Contextual_Factors_and_How_These_Affect_the_Pedagogical_Use_of_ICT","226312241_School_Practices_and_Conditions_for_Pedagogy_and_ICT","226198357_Introduction_to_SITES_2006","220694510_Diffusion_of_innovations_5_ed","44832712_The_Moral_Imperative_of_School_Leadership","44817501_The_New_Meaning_of_Educational_Change","8667118_Adoption_of_innovations_by_specialised_nurses_Personal_work_and_organisational_characteristics","7272540_The_diffusion_of_innovation_in_dentistry_A_review_using_rotary_nickel-titanium_technology_as_an_example"]}
