{"id":"353356366_Development_of_a_system_to_support_warfarin_dose_decisions_using_deep_neural_networks","abstract":"The first aim of this study was to develop a prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT INR) prediction model. The second aim was to develop a warfarin maintenance dose decision support system as a precise warfarin dosing platform. Data of 19,719 inpatients from three institutions was analyzed. The PT INR prediction algorithm included dense and recurrent neural networks, and was designed to predict the 5th-day PT INR from data of days 1–4. Data from patients in one hospital (n = 22,314) was used to train the algorithm which was tested with the datasets from the other two hospitals (n = 12,673). The performance of 5th-day PT INR prediction was compared with 2000 predictions made by 10 expert physicians. A generator of individualized warfarin dose-PT INR tables which simulated the repeated administration of varying doses of warfarin was developed based on the prediction model. The algorithm outperformed humans with accuracy terms of within ± 0.3 of the actual value (machine learning algorithm: 10,650/12,673 cases (84.0%), expert physicians: 1647/2000 cases (81.9%), P = 0.014). In the individualized warfarin dose-PT INR tables generated by the algorithm, the 8th-day PT INR predictions were within 0.3 of actual value in 450/842 cases (53.4%). An artificial intelligence-based warfarin dosing algorithm using a recurrent neural network outperformed expert physicians in predicting future PT INRs. An individualized warfarin dose-PT INR table generator which was constructed based on this algorithm was acceptable.","authors":["Heemoon Lee","Hyun Joo Kim","Hyoung Woo Chang","Dong Jung Kim"],"meta":["July 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-94305-2"],"references":["338747036_Machine_Learning_Algorithm_for_Predicting_Warfarin_Dose_in_Caribbean_Hispanics_Using_Pharmacogenetic_Data","327869661_Non-Vitamin_K_Antagonist_Oral_Anticoagulants_for_Mechanical_Heart_Valves_Is_the_Door_Still_Open","325997596_Warfarin_maintenance_dose_Prediction_for_Patients_undergoing_heart_valve_replacement_-_A_hybrid_model_with_genetic_algorithm_and_Back-Propagation_neural_network","325125142_A_New_Approach_towards_Minimizing_the_Risk_of_Misdosing_Warfarin_Initiation_Doses","301697757_An_expanded_pharmacogenomics_warfarin_dosing_table_with_utility_in_generalised_dosing_guidance","279160285_Revisiting_Warfarin_Dosing_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","275047867_Comparison_of_the_predictive_abilities_of_pharmacogenetics-based_warfarin_dosing_algorithms_using_seven_mathematical_models_in_Chinese_patients","312760686_A_comparison_of_dabigatran_etexilate_with_warfarin_in_patients_with_mechanical_heart_valves","312235486_Loading_Dose_of_Warfarin","288838524_Mathematical_model_and_calculation_to_predict_the_effect_of_prophylactic_plasma_transfusion_on_change_in_international_normalized_ratio_in_critically_ill_patients_with_coagulopathy","258019501_Dabigatran_versus_Warfarin_in_Patients_with_Mechanical_Heart_Valves","50936256_High_Dimensional_Pharmacogenetic_Prediction_of_a_Continuous_Trait_using_Machine_Learning_Techniques_with_Application_to_Warfarin_Dose_Prediction_in_African_Americans","272952688_Interactions_of_Warfarin_with_Drugs_and_Food","227341462_A_comparison_of_dabigatran_etexilate_with_warfarin_in_patients_with_mechanical_heart_valves_The_Randomized_phase_II_study_to_Evaluate_the_sAfety_and_pharmacokinetics_of_oraL_dabIGatran_etexilate_in_pa","224854175_Predicting_warfarin_dosage_from_clinical_data_A_supervised_learning_approach"]}
