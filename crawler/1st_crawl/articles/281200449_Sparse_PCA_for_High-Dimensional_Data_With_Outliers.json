{"id":"281200449_Sparse_PCA_for_High-Dimensional_Data_With_Outliers","abstract":"A new sparse PCA algorithm is presented which is robust against outliers. The approach is based on the ROBPCA algorithm which generates robust but non-sparse loadings. The construction of the new ROSPCA method is detailed, as well as a selection criterion for the sparsity parameter. An extensive simulation study and a real data example are performed, showing that it is capable of accurately finding the sparse structure of datasets, even when challenging outliers are present. In comparison with a projection pursuit based algorithm, ROSPCA demonstrates superior robustness properties and comparable sparsity estimation capability, as well as significantly faster computation time.","authors":["Mia Hubert","Tom Reynkens","Eric Schmitt","Tim Verdonck"],"meta":["October 2016Technometrics 58(4):424-434","DOI:10.1080/00401706.2015.1093962"],"references":["299165487_Robust_principal_component_analysis_for_functional_data_-_Rejoinder","278694877_Comparing_Classical_and_Robust_Sparse_PCA","247151979_Least_Median_of_Squares_Regression","245023623_ROBPCA_A_new_approach_to_robust_principal_component_analysis","245023407_A_Fast_method_for_robust_principal_components_with_applications_to_chemometrics","243787303_Loadings_and_correlations_in_the_interpretation_of_principal_components","303349470_Numerical_methods_for_computing_angles_between_linear_subspaces","274015857_Team_RDCR_A_Language_And_Environment_For_Statistical_Computing_R_Foundation_for_Statistical_Computing_Vienna_Austria","258194334_pcaPP_Robust_PCA_by_Projection_Pursuit","243796480_Quantitative_analysis_of_16-17th_century_archaeological_glass_vessels_using_PLS_regression_of_EPXMA_and_m-XRF_data"]}
