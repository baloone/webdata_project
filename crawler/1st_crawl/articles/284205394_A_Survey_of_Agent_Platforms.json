{"id":"284205394_A_Survey_of_Agent_Platforms","abstract":"From computer games to human societies, many natural and artificial phenomena can be represented as multi-agent systems. Over time, these systems have been proven a really powerful tool for modelling and understanding phenomena in fields, such as economics and trading, health care, urban planning and social sciences. However, although, intelligent agents have been around for years, their actual implementation is still in its early stages. Since the late nineties many agent platforms have been developed. Some of them have already been abandoned whereas others continue releasing new versions. On the other hand, the agent-oriented research community is still providing more and more new platforms. This vast amount of platform options leads to a high degree of heterogeneity. Hence, a common problem is how people interested in using multi-agent systems should choose which platform to use in order to benefit from agent technology. This decision was usually left to word of mouth, past experiences or platform publicity, lately however people depend on solid survey articles. To date, in most cases multiagent system surveys describe only the basic characteristics of a few representatives without even providing any classification of the systems themselves. This article presents a comparative up-to-date review of the most promising existing agent platforms that can be used. It is based on universal comparison and evaluation criteria, proposing classifications for helping readers to understand which agent platforms broadly exhibit similar properties and in which situations which choices should be made.","authors":["Kalliopi Kravari","Nick Bassiliades"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, The 18(1)","DOI:10.18564/jasss.2661"],"references":["283854954_Agent_Platform_Evaluation_and_Comparison","259679423_GAMA_16_Advancing_the_Art_of_Complex_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Simulation","257481979_MiRA-mixed_reality_agents","250037721_NetLogo_Design_and_implementation_of_a_multi-agent_modeling_environment","224624924_Cougaar_A_Robust_Configurable_Multi_Agent_Platform","221455307_Everything_can_be_Agent","278101032_A_Declarative_Model_Assembly_Infrastructure_for_Verification_and_Validation","262411444_Cross-community_interoperation_between_knowledge-based_multi-agent_systems_A_study_on_EMERALD_and_Rule_Responder","260135032_Programming_Multi-Agent_Systems_in_AgentSpeak_Using_Jason","253538430_A_Universal_Criteria_Catalog_for_Evaluation_of_Heterogeneous_Agent_Development_Artifacts","221251322_The_Future_of_Disaster_Response_Humans_Working_with_Multiagent_Teams_using_DEFACTO","221248676_Agent_Factory_A_Framework_for_Prototyping_Logic-Based_AOP_Languages","221238808_EMERALD_A_Multi-Agent_System_for_Knowledge-Based_Reasoning_Interoperability_in_the_Semantic_Web","221156132_A_Framework_for_Developing_Agent-Based_Distributed_Applications","221454827_Deployment_of_A-globe_multi-agent_platform"]}
