In computer science AI\nresearch is defined as the study of \"intelligent agents\":\nany device that perceives its environment (using\nsensors) and takes actions that maximize its chance of\nsuccess at some goal (acting upon that environment\nthrough actuators). This. Colloquially, the term\n\"artificial intelligence\" is applied when a machine\nmimics \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with\nother human minds, such as \"learning\" and \"problem\nsolving â€œconcept. [1].\nAt present any microprocessor-based relay protection is\ncalled an \"Intelligent Electronic Device\" (IED). These\ncircumstances may be misleading, because the concept\nof \"intellectual system\" has already developed a certain\nunderstanding associated with the development of\ntechnologies for creating \"artificial intelligence\" [2].\nThe present paper analyzes the mean of AI and some\nimplementation possibilities in the Electrical Industry,\nproviding also an application example of a device with\ncapability to identify extremely high resistance faults\n(HiZ) in distribution networks.\n\nMore information can be found in www.adneli.com","authors":["Jorge Cardenas"],"meta":["April 2018","Project: Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["320945147_The_Industrial_Internet_IIoT_in_the_Management_Optimization_of_the_Electrical_Grid","224643688_Field_Experience_with_High-Impedance_Fault_Detection_Relays","4245087_Field_Experience_with_High-Impedance_Fault_Detection_Relays"]}
