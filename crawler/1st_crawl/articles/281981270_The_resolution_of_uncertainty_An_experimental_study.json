{"id":"281981270_The_resolution_of_uncertainty_An_experimental_study","abstract":"Meaningful decision problems often involve intertemporal choices. In the case of uncertainty, the resolution of uncertainty is an essential feature of decision alternatives. Early resolution of uncertainty might offer planning benefits, late resolution might be preferred for decision makers who want to hope as long as possible for a good consequence. The focus of this paper is entirely descriptive. We present an experimental study investigating subjects' resolution preference. We find that some subjects prefer early and some prefer late resolution of uncertainty. We also find that this preference systematically depends on the source of utility and on the probabilities involved.","authors":["M. Ahlbrecht","M.
