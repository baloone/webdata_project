{"id":"314294432_Numerical_Modeling_of_virus_transmission_in_a_computer_network","abstract":"Numerical Modeling involves construction, implementation and analysis of reliable numerical schemes to solve continuous models. These schemes are constructed with the aim that discrete model exhibits the same behavior as the continuous model. Discrete models must preserve some very important properties like dynamical consistency, positivity and boundedness of the solution. In this paper, a dynamical model for the transmission dynamics of virus in a computer network is analyzed numerically. An unconditionally convergent numerical model has been proposed and analyzed for the same problem. Results are compared with well-known numerical schemes i.e. Euler and Runge-Kutta method of order four (RK-4). Unlike Euler and RK-4 which fail for certain step sizes, the proposed numerical scheme preserves all the essential properties of continuous model and converged to true steady states of the model for any step size used.","authors":["Muhammad Rafiq Malik","Ali Raza Cheema","Arfa Anayat"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1109/IBCAST.2017.7868087","Conference: 2017 14th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences and Technology (IBCAST)"],"references":["258399629_Modeling_Computer_Virus_and_Its_Dynamics","223458007_SEIRS_epidemic_model_with_delay_for_transmission_of_malicious_objects_in_computer_network","222523138_Dealing_with_software_viruses_A_biological_paradigm","251627224_Delayed_computer_virus_propagation_model_and_its_dynamics","247207258_Population_Biology_of_Infectious_Diseases","233175294_Exact_finite_difference_and_non-standard_finite_difference_schemes_for","228922545_Modeling_and_analyzing_of_botnet_interactions","224043450_Mathematical_Models_in_Population_Biology_and_Epidemiology_Springer_New_York","223248954_Fixed_period_of_temporary_immunity_after_run_of_anti-malicious_software_on_computer_nodes","222651207_Global_analysis_of_an_SEIR_model_with_varying_population_size_and_vaccination"]}
