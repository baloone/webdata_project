{"id":"318814221_Recognizing_Graphs_Close_to_Bipartite_Graphs_with_an_Application_to_Colouring_Reconfiguration","abstract":"We continue research into a well-studied family of problems that ask whether the vertices of a graph can be partitioned into sets $A$ and~$B$, where $A$ is an independent set and $B$ induces a graph from some specified graph class ${\\cal G}$. We let ${\\cal G}$ be the class of $k$-degenerate graphs. This problem is known to be polynomial-time solvable if $k=0$ (bipartite graphs) and NP-complete if $k=1$ (near-bipartite graphs) even for graphs of maximum degree $4$. Yang and Yuan [DM, 2006] showed that the $k=1$ case is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of maximum degree $3$. This also follows from a result of Catlin and Lai [DM, 1995]. We consider graphs of maximum degree $k+2$ on $n$ vertices. We show how to find $A$ and $B$ in $O(n)$ time for $k=1$, and in $O(n^2)$ time for $k\\geq 2$. Together, these results provide an algorithmic version of a result of Catlin [JCTB, 1979] and also provide an algorithmic version of a generalization of Brook's Theorem, which was proven in a more general way by Borodin, Kostochka and Toft [DM, 2000] and Matamala [JGT, 2007]. Moreover, the two results enable us to complete the complexity classification of an open problem of Feghali et al. [JGT, 2016]: finding a path in the vertex colouring reconfiguration graph between two given $\\ell$-colourings of a graph of maximum degree $k$.","authors":["Marthe Bonamy","Konrad Kazimierz Dabrowski","Carl Feghali","Matthew Johnson"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Graph Theory 98(1)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.22683"],"references":["318813958_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Sets_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Diameter","318813787_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Set_for_P_5-Free_Graphs","276458326_Finding_Shortest_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings","276378124_Recognition_of_Unipolar_and_Generalised_Split_Graphs","318540153_Partitioning_a_triangle-free_planar_graph_into_a_forest_and_a_forest_of_bounded_degree","285207706_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring_and_CSP_Reconfiguration","284132954_Partitioning_a_triangle-free_planar_graph_into_a_forest_and_a_forest_of_bounded_degree","277976289_Algorithms_for_the_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem","271387962_A_Reconfigurations_Analogue_of_Brooks'_Theorem_and_Its_Consequences","271225749_Stable-_P_partitions_of_graphs"]}
