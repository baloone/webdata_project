{"id":"333462237_Supercomputing_technologies_in_the_digital_world_theory_practice_education","abstract":"Supercomputing technologies are used in almost all fields of science today, and determine the competitiveness of science and industry among national entities. USA, Europe, China, and Japan are investing billions in the development of supercomputing technologies, promoting national programs for the development of this field, and these programs will determine the success of future developments. The underestimation of the value of supercomputing technologies has led Russia to fall behind in global trends, and squanders the enormous potential of Russian specialists in computer science. Russia needs a comprehensive supercomputer program, and cannot delay its enactment.","authors":["Vladimir Voevodin"],"meta":["April 2019Vestnik Rossijkoj Akademii Nauk 89(4):351-354","DOI:10.31857/S0869-5873894351-354"],"references":[]}
