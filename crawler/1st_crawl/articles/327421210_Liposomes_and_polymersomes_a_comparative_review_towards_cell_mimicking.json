{"id":"327421210_Liposomes_and_polymersomes_a_comparative_review_towards_cell_mimicking","abstract":"Cells are integral to all forms of life due to their compartmentalization by the plasma membrane. However, living organisms are immensely complex. Thus there is a need for simplified and controllable models of life for a deeper understanding of fundamental biological processes and man-made applications. This is where the bottom-up approach of synthetic biology comes from: a stepwise assembly of biomimetic functionalities ultimately into a protocell. A fundamental feature of such an endeavor is the generation and control of model membranes such as liposomes and polymersomes. We compare and contrast liposomes and polymersomes for a better a priori choice and design of vesicles and try to understand the advantages and shortcomings associated with using one or the other in many different aspects (properties, synthesis, self-assembly, applications) and which aspects have been studied and developed with each type and update the current development in the field.","authors":["Emeline Rideau","Rumiana Dimova","Petra Schwille","Frederik R Wurm"],"meta":["September 2018Chemical Society Reviews 47(23)","DOI:10.1039/C8CS00162F"],"references":["325408262_Photosynthetic_artificial_organelles_sustain_and_control_ATP-dependent_reactions_in_a_protocellular_system","324818146_Light-induced_ATP_driven_self-assembly_of_actin_heavy-meromyosin_in_a_proteo-tubularsomes_as_a_step_toward_an_artificial_cell","324682137_Mastering_Complexity_Towards_Bottom-up_Construction_of_Multifunctional_Eukaryotic_Synthetic_Cells","323856815_Biomimetic_artificial_organelles_with_in_vitro_and_in_vivo_activity_triggered_by_reduction_in_microenvironment","323782346_Light-triggered_enzymatic_reactions_in_nested_vesicle_reactors","323758064_Constructing_vesicle-based_artificial_cells_with_embedded_living_cells_as_organelle-like_modules","340906231_Cell_Biology_by_the_Numbers","325276738_Orientation_assignment_of_LH2_and_LH1-RC_complexes_from_Thermochromatium_tepidum_reconstituted_in_PC_liposome_and_their_ultrafast_excitation_dynamics_comparison_between_in_artificial_and_in_natural_ch","324220997_Feedback-Induced_Temporal_Control_of_Breathing_Polymersomes_To_Create_Self-Adaptive_Nanoreactors","323505431_A_reverse-phase_method_revisited_Rapid_high-yield_preparation_of_giant_unilamellar_vesicles_GUVs_using_emulsification_followed_by_centrifugation"]}
