{"id":"321105944_Engineering_of_assembly_systems_using_graph_-based_design_languages","abstract":"Car Manufacturers are subject to continuous and fundamental changes. Already today increasing time pressure, rising complexity and a soaring cost pressure require a shorter time to market. As assembly planning is one of car manufacturers' core competence an innovative approach to adapt the processes is needed. This paper presents the early idea of a novel approach for an automated design process covering the early design phase of assembly systems. Integrating various input data as well as requirements leads to a are a base for this approach for designing an assembly system. Uncertain input data, which are fact within early planning phases, need to be considered in order to reach a holistic planning alternatives for evaluation, optimization and afterwards decision-making. With so-called graph-based design languages an automated and efficient design process will be implemented. This leads to a faster designing process in order to reduce planning time and planning costs and reach resilient and sustainable decisions.","authors":["Theresa Breckle","Jens Kiefer","Stephan Rudolph","Martin Manns"],"meta":["August 2017","Conference: 21st International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED 17) 21-25.08.2017At: Vancouver, Canada,"],"references":["319776436_Uber_Ordnungsmechanismen_im_wissensbasierten_Entwurf_von_SCR-Systemen","303224548_Automotive_Revolution_Perspective_Towards_2030","279382071_Application-specific_UML_profiles_for_multidisciplinary_product_data_integration","279382031_Aufbau_und_Einsatz_von_Entwurfssprachen_zur_Auslegung_von_Satelliten","251423341_Modellgenerierung_im_Kontext_der_Digitalen_Fabrik_-_Stand_der_Technik_und_Herausforderungen","30872105_How_Designers_Think_-_The_Design_Process_Demystified","317840881_Integrated_Design_of_a_Product_Family_and_Its_Assembly_System","316269616_Konzeptentwicklung_und_Gestaltung_technischer_Produkte","313852933_Praxis_der_Montagetechnik","310402982_From_data_to_wisdom","256673855_Complexity_in_engineering_design_and_manufacturing","252165941_Digitale_Fabrik","245226537_Manufacturing_System_Design","43185094_Fabrikplanung_und_Fabrikbetrieb_Methoden_fur_die_wandlungsfahige_und_vernetzte_Fabrik"]}
