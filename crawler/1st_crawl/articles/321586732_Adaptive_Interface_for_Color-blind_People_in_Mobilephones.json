{"id":"321586732_Adaptive_Interface_for_Color-blind_People_in_Mobilephones","abstract":"This paper explores and evaluates the adaptive features provided by the different mobile operating systems (OS) for color-blind users. It presents a brief of color-blind disability and the challenges faced by color-blind users while operating mobile phones. The mobile OS provide static color-blind color schemes for different types of color-blind users that need to be adapted manually. A research application is developed to introduce an adaptive interface scheme with sensing of the color-blindness type and switch to respective color-blind mode. The evaluation of this adaptive environment is performed through usability experimentation. User task effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction are the criterion for the said evaluation. The results concluded that the provided color-blind modes may increase the usability in user satisfaction but not much gain can be obtained in effectiveness and efficiency. It is also found that only switching to respective mode might not make much difference in adaptive and non-adaptive environment until the adaptive interfaces are properly designed through user centered design (UCD) for specific users.","authors":["Muhammad Waseem Iqbal","Syed Khuram Shahzad","Nadeem Ahmad","Alessia Amelio"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1109/ICACS.2018.8333488","Conference: International Conference on Advancements in Computational SciencesAt: Lahore, PakistanVolume: IEEE Computer Society"],"references":["319445937_Usability_evaluation_of_adaptive_features_in_smartphones","311832580_A_Vision_of_Traffic_Lights_for_Color-Blind_People","290226421_Implementation_of_color-blind_aid_system","289082255_Integrating_adaptation_and_HCI_concepts_to_support_usability_in_user_interfaces_A_rule-based_approach","288357859_Designing_maps_for_the_colour-vision_impaired","277606386_Smart_Phone_Application_Evaluation_with_Usability_Testing_Approach","275339974_A_Comparative_Study_of_Mobile_Phone's_Operating_Systems","274068611_People_centered_HMI's_for_deaf_and_functionally_illiterate_users","269670816_A_Case_Study_of_Color_Combination_Issues_in_Various_Websites","261210199_Mobile_services_supporting_color_vision_deficiency","261175632_Adaptive_Model-Driven_User_Interface_Development_Systems","257488361_Evaluating_Interface_Layout_for_Visually_and_Mobility_Impaired_Users_through_Simulation","241623461_Improving_Calibration_Time_and_Accuracy_for_Situation-Specific_Models_of_Color_Differentiation_To_appear_ASSETS","228913414_An_Adaptative_Fuzzy-Based_System_to_Evaluate_Color_Blindness","227991322_Usability_Testing","225261962_Can_Adaptive_Interfaces_Improve_the_Usability_of_Mobile_Applications","224752312_Towards_image_retrieval_for_eight_percent_of_color-blind_men","224227331_Temporal_Color_Consistency-Based_Video_Reproduction_for_Dichromats","221516512_An_interface_to_support_color_blind_computer_users","220733211_Image_recolorization_for_the_colorblind","38015459_A_Physiologically-Based_Model_for_Simulation_of_Color_Vision_Deficiency_vol_15_pg_1291_2009","328124708_Research_Methods_in_Human-Computer_Interaction","282255156_An_interactive_app_for_color_deficient_viewers","261985809_Usability_of_Online_Assistance_From_Semi-literate_Users'_Perspective","235410901_Interaction_and_Recognition_Challenges_in_Interpreting_Children's_Touch_and_Gesture_Input_on_Mobile_Devices","228543488_Human-Computer_Interaction_Standards","223497537_Benefits_and_costs_of_adaptive_user_interfaces","222561297_International_standards_for_HCI_and_usability","221098937_Fine-Grained_Adaptive_User_Interface_for_Personalization_of_a_Word_Processor_Principles_and_a_Preliminary_Study"]}
