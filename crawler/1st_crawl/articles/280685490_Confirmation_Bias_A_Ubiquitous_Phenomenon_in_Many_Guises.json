{"id":"280685490_Confirmation_Bias_A_Ubiquitous_Phenomenon_in_Many_Guises","abstract":"Confirmation bias, as the term is typically used in the psychological literature, connotes the seeking or interpreting of evidence in ways that are partial to existing beliefs, expectations, or a hypothesis in hand. The author reviews evidence of such a bias in a variety of guises and gives examples of its operation in several practical contexts. Possible explanations are considered, and the question of its utility or disutility is discussed.","authors":["Raymond Nickerson"],"meta":["June 1998Review of General Psychology 2(2):175-220","DOI:10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175"],"references":["350653652_The_Psychology_of_Deductive_Reasoning_Psychology_Revivals","349128952_Mathematics_and_Plausible_Reasoning_Volume_1_Induction_and_Analogy_in_Mathematics","346675311_The_story_model_for_juror_decision_making","346642185_Informal_covariation_assessment_Data-based_versus_theory-based_judgments","344904534_Rationality_and_Intelligence","344844825_Shortcomings_in_the_attribution_process_On_the_origins_and_maintenance_of_erroneous_social_assessments","332690722_Semantics_and_Comprehension","332646607_Semantics_And_Comprehension","324461053_The_American_Jury","324376900_Change_in_View_Principles_of_Reasoning"]}
