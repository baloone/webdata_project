{"id":"9056033_In_Two_Minds_Dual-Process_Accounts_of_Reasoning","abstract":"Researchers in thinking and reasoning have proposed recently that there are two distinct cognitive systems underlying reasoning. System 1 is old in evolutionary terms and shared with other animals: it comprises a set of autonomous subsystems that include both innate input modules and domain-specific knowledge acquired by a domain-general learning mechanism. System 2 is evolutionarily recent and distinctively human: it permits abstract reasoning and hypothetical thinking, but is constrained by working memory capacity and correlated with measures of general intelligence. These theories essentially posit two minds in one brain with a range of experimental psychological evidence showing that the two systems compete for control of our inferences and actions.","authors":["Jonathan St B T Evans"],"meta":["November 2003Trends in Cognitive Sciences 7(10):454-9","DOI:10.1016/j.tics.2003.08.012","SourcePubMed"],"references":["252664640_Evolutionary_Versus_Instrumental_Goals_How_Evolutionary_Psychology_Misconceives_Human_Rationality","240239751_Individual_Differences_in_Working_Memory_and_Conditional_Reasoning_with_Concrete_and_Abstract_Content","237518293_Hempel's_Paradox_and_Wason's_Selection_Task_Logical_and_Psychological_Puzzles_of_Confirmation","229071271_Representativeness_Revisited_Attribute_Substitution_in_Intuitive_Judgment","228580834_Cognitive_Ability_and_Variation_in_Selection_Task_Performance","225130187_Is_probability_matching_smart_Associations_between_probabilistic_choices_and_cognitive_ability","222504218_Are_Humans_Good_Intuitive_Statisticians_After_All_Rethinking_Some_Conclusions_from_the_Literature_on_Judgment_Under_Uncertainty","222423421_Frequency_Illusions_and_Other_Fallacies","200045300_The_Empirical_Case_For_Two_Systems_of_Reasoning","31229920_Evolutionary_Psychology_the_Massive_Modularity_Hypothesis","12342529_No_interpretation_without_representation_The_role_of_domain-specific_representations_and_inferences_in_the_Wason_Selection_Task","12031916_A_Theory_of_Implicit_and_Explicit_Knowledge","12031890_Individual_Differences_in_Reasoning_Implications_for_the_Rationality_Debate","11336514_Background_beliefs_in_Bayesian_inference","11086323_Conditionals_A_Theory_of_Meaning_Pragmatics_and_Inference","10976376_Explaining_Modulation_of_Reasoning_by_Belief","10651687_Explicit_and_implicit_processes_in_multicue_judgment","325671241_Conditionals_A_theory_of_meaning_pragmatics_and_inference","289963936_Reasoning_ability_is_little_more_than_working-memory_capacity","289963056_Reasoning_ability_is_little_more_than_working-memory_capacity","286786460_Thinking_and_believing","284860066_Human_evolution_and_the_cognitive_basis_of_science","281195998_Introduction_-_Heuristics_and_Biases_Then_and_Now","278146289_Logic_and_human_reasoning_An_assessment_of_the_deduction_paradigm","263917133_Reasoning_Independently_of_Prior_Belief_and_Individual_Differences_in_Actively_Open-Minded_Thinking","263749390_The_Influence_of_Linguistic_Form_on_Reasoning_The_Case_of_Matching_Bias","259645852_Rationality_in_an_uncertain_world_Essays_on_the_cognitive_science_of_human_reasoning","247515591_Working_memory_and_reasoning_An_individual_differences_perspective","246773747_Matching_Bias_in_Conditional_Reasoning_Do_We_Understand_it_After_25_Years","232460655_The_elusive_thematic-materials_effect_in_Wason's_selection_task","232173355_On_belief_bias_in_syllogistic_reasoning","223623866_Relevance_theory_explains_the_selection_task","222839119_Frequency_versus_probability_formats_in_statistical_word_problems","222395840_Solving_probabilistic_and_statistical_problems_A_matter_of_information_structure_and_question_form","16575665_On_the_Conflict_between_Logic_and_Belief_in_Syllogistic_Reasoning","15200563_Working_memory_and_bias_in_reasoning_across_the_life_span","12289276_Dissociation_of_Mechanisms_Underlying_Syllogistic_Reasoning","12271625_Shifting_from_the_Perceptual_Brain_to_the_Logical_Brain_The_Neural_Impact_of_Cognitive_Inhibition_Training","12267722_The_Episodic_Buffer_A_New_Component_of_Working_Memory","12220218_Motivated_Scientific_Reasoning_Biases_Epistemological_Beliefs_and_Theory_Polarization_A_Two-Process_Approach_to_Adolescent_Cognition","11933468_Analytic_and_Heuristic_Processing_Influences_on_Adolescent_Reasoning_and_Decision-Making","11865823_The_probabilistic_approach_to_human_reasoning","11799485_Necessity_Possibility_and_Belief_A_Study_of_Syllogistic_Reasoning","11648133_Access_to_Deductive_Logic_Depends_on_a_Right_Ventromedial_Prefrontal_Area_Devoted_to_Emotion_and_Feeling_Evidence_from_a_Training_Paradigm","11522049_Implicit_and_explicit_processes_in_a_hypothesis_testing_task","11328042_Representation_facilitates_reasoning_What_natural_frequencies_are_and_what_they_are_not","11218353_Use_or_misuse_of_the_selection_task_Rejoinder_to_Fiddick_Cosmides_and_Tooby","11081731_Heuristic_and_analytic_processing_Age_trends_and_associations_with_cognitive_ability_and_cognitive_styles","11059241_Logic_and_Human_Reasoning_An_Assessment_of_the_Deduction_Paradigm","5597411_Judgments_under_uncertainty_Representativeness_or_potential_surprise"]}
