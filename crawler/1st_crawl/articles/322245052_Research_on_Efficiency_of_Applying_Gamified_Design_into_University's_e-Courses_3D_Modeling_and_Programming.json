Our research was conducted within two higher education institutions and includes full-time and part-time students who enrolled in the courses 3D modeling and Programming. Based on the research results, three hypotheses were tested. These hypotheses give a better insight into some psychological phenomes. The first hypotheses tested the level of knowledge in experimental and control groups for all students who achieved a minimum of 50% score in the pre-test. Our results confirmed the existence of statistically significant difference in the benefit of the experimental group. The other two hypotheses are spreading results even more. We analyzed 50% of the highest ranked and also 50% of the lowest ranked students' score with the use of t-test. Based on our analysis of the average number of points on the post-test for participants with the lowest ranking we found no statistically significant difference. On the other hand, the same analysis for participants with the highest ranking shows, with statistically significant difference, that the experimental group achieved notably better score.","authors":["Andrija Bernik","Danijel Radosevic","Daniel Strmeƒçki"],"meta":["January 2018Journal of Computer Science 13(12)","DOI:10.3844/jcssp.2017.718.727","Project: Gamification"],"references":["323411799_Applying_Gamification_in_a_Parallel_Programming_Course","318690383_Introducing_gamification_into_e-learning_university_courses","317989357_Use_of_Gamification_to_Teach_Agile_Values_and_Collaboration_A_multi-week_Scrum_simulation_project_in_an_undergraduate_software_engineering_course","283636584_A_Pilot_Study_of_the_Influence_of_Gamification_on_the_Effectiveness_of_an_e-Learning_Course","282599647_The_Model_for_Introduction_of_Gamification_into_E-learning_in_Higher_Education","266853048_Play_As_You_Learn_Gamification_as_a_Technique_for_Motivating_Learners","317813574_Engaged_Cohorts_Can_Gamification_Engage_All_College_Students_in_Class","317620241_A_Framework_for_Gamification_in_Software_Engineering","312077966_Impact_of_Gamification_on_Code_review_process_An_Experimental_Study","301411666_Gamification_framework_model_based_on_social_engagement_in_e-learning_20"]}
