A couple of their more interesting characteristics include: They are capable of hovering and flying at high and low speeds, and they can move in any direction and take off and land vertically. A very promising class of these vehicles comprises small vehicles that can be flown either indoor or outdoor and offer the possibility for near-area surveillance, crop dusting, precision farming [1], microwave autonomous copter systems for geological remote sensing as shown in [2], geographic studies, fire monitoring, security applications, search- and-rescue, and attack and rendezvous [3], [4]. However, challenging requirements in terms of size, weight, and maneuverability for these systems are presented in [5]. A type of aircraft with an important and significant potential is the so-called Quadrotor that is considered by most research studies as a promising UAV [6].","authors":["Hassan Shraim","Ali Awada","Rafic Younes"],"meta":["July 2018IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine 33(7):14-33","DOI:10.1109/MAES.2018.160246","Project: Vehicle Dynamics"],"references":["302580086_Quadrotors_unmanned_aerial_vehicles_A_review","294091261_Fault_Estimation_For_a_Quad-rotor_MAV_Using_a_Polynomial_Observer","288157659_Benchmarking_of_obstacle_field_navigation_algorithms_for_autonomous_helicopters","286275844_A_Survey_of_Modelling_and_Identification_of_Quadrotor_Robot","282374690_Topology-Dependent_Stability_of_a_Network_of_Dynamical_Systems_with_Communication_Delays","281558507_Design_and_Development_of_an_Y4_Copter_Control_System","276499059_A_Review_of_Control_Algorithms_for_Autonomous_Quadrotors","273292167_Fault_Diagnosis_in_a_Networked_Control_System_under_Communication_Constraints_A_Quadrotor_Application","272474564_Robust_Control_Algorithm_Considering_the_Actuator_Faults_for_Attitude_Tracking_of_an_UAV_Quadrotor_Aircraft","270723492_A_Survey_of_Small-Scale_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles_Recent_Advances_and_Future_Development_Trends","269299851_Cooperative_sense_and_avoid_Implementation_in_simulation_and_real_world_for_small_unmanned_aerial_vehicles","269299843_Decision_strategies_for_automated_visual_collision_avoidance","268557091_System_Identification_of_a_Quadrotor_Micro_Air_Vehicle","267490301_Classification_of_Flapping_Wing_Mechanisms_for_Micro_Air_Vehicles","264923020_A_mixed_active_and_passive_GLR_test_for_a_fault_tolerant_control_system","333758867_Design_and_Development_of_an_Y4_Copter_Control_System","325912416_Position_trajectory_tracking_of_a_quadrotor_helicopter_based_on_L1_adaptive_control","321621086_Delay_Effects_on_Stability_A_Robust_Control_Approach","317130621_Linear_time_delay_systems_Some_recent_advances_and_open_problems_1","317019305_Bibliographical_review_on_reconfigurable_fault-tolerant_control_systems","313029063_Basic_helicopter_aerodynamics_Second_edition","312942865_Backstepping_and_Sliding-mode_Techniques_Applied_to_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","288537775_Sensor_fault_diagnosis_in_quadrotors_using_nonlinear_adaptive_estimators","279386500_Sliding_Modes_in_Control_and_Optimization","279357913_Sliding_Modes_in_Control_and_Optimization","279357910_Sliding_Modes_in_Control_and_Optimization","271492503_A_Feedback_Linearization_Approach_to_Fault_Tolerance_in_Quadrotor_Vehicles","271326573_Robust_Model-based_Fault_Diagnosis_for_Dynamic_Systems","269500408_Detection_of_Abrupt_Changes_Theory_and_Applications","269263981_A_Fault_Detection_and_Diagnosis_Technique_for_Spacecraft_in_Formation_Flying","269217795_Fault_Detection_and_Diagnosis_for_GTM_UAV_with_dual_Unscented_Kalman_Filter","269074744_Observer_Based_Residual_Generation_and_Evaluation_of_Networked_Control_Systems_Subject_to_Random_Packet_Dropout","268676196_A_real-Time_Vision-based_Frontal_obstacle_detection_snad_avoidance_for_low_cost_UAVs_in_GPS_denied_Environment","268571415_A_Combined_MBPC2_DOF_H_infinity_Controller_for_a_Quad_Rotor_UAV","268571037_A_Review_on_Fault-tolerant_Control_for_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles_UAVs","268557581_Dynamics_and_Optimal_Control_of_Quadrotor_Platform","268557547_Development_of_a_Cross_Style_Quadrotor","268556555_Simulation_and_Robust_Backstepping_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_Aircraft","268554626_Reactive_Vision_Based_Obstacle_Avoidance_with_Camera_Field_of_View_Constraints","268048450_Nonlinear_Control_of_Vehicles_and_Robots","267700779_Control_of_Quadrotors_for_Robust_Perching_and_Landing","267070500_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Networked_Control_Systems","266378280_Modeling_and_Performance_Assessment_of_the_HyTAQ_a_Hybrid_TerrestrialAerial_Quadrotor","266293969_Development_of_Fault_Detection_and_Diagnosis_Techniques_with_Applications_to_Fixed-wing_and_Rotary-wing_UAVs","266089392_Adaptive_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_with_Dynamic_Changes_in_the_Center_of_Gravity","264199284_Identification_of_Linear_Models_for_the_Dynamics_of_a_Hovering_Quadrotor","263879970_Guaranteed_cost_control_of_networked_control_systems_with_time-delays_and_packet_losses","262938435_A_Review_on_Basic_Data-Driven_Approaches_for_Industrial_Process_Monitoring","262934034_A_Generic_Strategy_for_Fault-Tolerance_in_Control_Systems_Distributed_Over_a_Network","262282858_A_Comparative_Study_of_Collision_Avoidance_Techniques_for_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","262166685_Approach_to_the_design_of_robust_networked_control_systems","261550850_A_Model-Based_Fault_Diagnosis_System_for_a_Mini-Quadrotor","261581214_Robust_fault_isolation_for_a_class_of_non-linear_input-output_systems","261503858_First_Flight_Tests_for_a_Quadrotor_UAV_with_Tilting_Propellers","261460005_Robust_attitude_tracking_control_of_a_quadrotor_helicopter_in_the_presence_of_uncertainty"]}
