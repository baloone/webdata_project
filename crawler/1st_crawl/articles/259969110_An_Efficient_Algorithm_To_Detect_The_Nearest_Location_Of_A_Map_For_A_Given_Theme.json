{"id":"259969110_An_Efficient_Algorithm_To_Detect_The_Nearest_Location_Of_A_Map_For_A_Given_Theme","abstract":"This paper presents an algorithm for efficient detection of the nearest police station for a specific position(coordinates). The algorithm is based on Geographic Information System (GIS), Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) and the J48 classification algorithm. In other words, the proposed algorithm is an effective integration of these three. The salient feature of this algorithm is that it facilitates the detection of the current ground position on a digital map accurately and easily. The algorithm is tested by detecting the nearest police station of a given coordinate of the Sri Lankan map. The test results reported an average accuracy of 87.92%.","authors":["M.A.P.
