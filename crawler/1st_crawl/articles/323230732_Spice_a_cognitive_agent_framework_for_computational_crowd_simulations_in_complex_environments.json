{"id":"323230732_Spice_a_cognitive_agent_framework_for_computational_crowd_simulations_in_complex_environments","abstract":"Pedestrian behavior is an omnipresent topic, but the underlying cognitive processes and the various influences on movement behavior are still not fully understood. Nonetheless, computational simulations that predict crowd behavior are essential for safety, economics, and transport. Contemporary approaches of pedestrian behavior modeling focus strongly on the movement aspects and seldom address the rich body of research from cognitive science. Similarly, general purpose cognitive architectures are not suitable for agents that can move in spatial domains because they do not consider the profound findings of pedestrian dynamics research. Thus, multi-agent simulations of crowd behavior that strongly incorporate both research domains have not yet been fully realized. Here, we propose the cognitive agent framework Spice. The framework provides an approach to structure pedestrian agent models by integrating concepts of pedestrian dynamics and cognition. Further, we provide a model that implements the framework. The model solves spatial sequential choice problems in sufficient detail, including movement and cognition aspects. We apply the model in a computer simulation and validate the Spice approach by means of data from an uncontrolled field study. The Spice framework is an important starting point for further research, as we believe that fostering interdisciplinary modeling approaches will be highly beneficial to the field of pedestrian dynamics.","authors":["Peter Michael Kielar","Andre Borrmann"],"meta":["May 2018Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems 32(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10458-018-9383-2"],"references":["346695104_Crowd_disasters_as_systemic_failures_analysis_of_the_Love_Parade_disaster","315536355_A_Unified_Pedestrian_Routing_Model_for_Graph-Based_Wayfinding_Built_on_Cognitive_Principles","313554168_Self-organized_pedestrian_crowd_dynamics_Experiments_simulations_and_design_solutions","309463160_A_Modular_Routing_Graph_Generation_Method_for_Pedestrian_Simulation","309462996_Coupling_Spatial_Task_Solving_Models_to_Simulate_Complex_Pedestrian_Behavior_Patterns","314380803_How_Do_People_Search_A_Modelling_Perspective","313092576_Microscopic_pedestrian_wayfinding_and_dynamics_modelling","312892892_Reflections_of_the_environment_in_memory","311568793_How_Do_People_Queue_A_Study_of_Different_Queuing_Models","310793152_Pedestrian_group_behavior_in_a_cellular_automaton"]}
