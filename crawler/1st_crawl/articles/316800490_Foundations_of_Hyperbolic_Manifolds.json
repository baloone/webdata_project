{"id":"316800490_Foundations_of_Hyperbolic_Manifolds","abstract":"This book is an exposition of the theoretical foundations of hyperbolic manifolds. It is intended to be used both as a textbook and as a reference. The reader is assumed to have a basic knowledge of algebra and topology at the first year graduate level of an American university. The book is divided into three parts. The first part, Chapters 1-7, is concerned with hyperbolic geometry and discrete groups. The second part, Chapters 8-12, is devoted to the theory of hyperbolic manifolds. The third part, Chapter 13, integrates the first two parts in a development of the theory of hyperbolic orbifolds. There are over 500 exercises in this book and more than 180 illustrations.","authors":["John G.
