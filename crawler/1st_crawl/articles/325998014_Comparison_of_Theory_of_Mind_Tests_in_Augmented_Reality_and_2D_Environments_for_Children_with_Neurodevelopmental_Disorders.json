{"id":"325998014_Comparison_of_Theory_of_Mind_Tests_in_Augmented_Reality_and_2D_Environments_for_Children_with_Neurodevelopmental_Disorders","abstract":"In this work, we use AR and 2D virtual environments to do TOM tests on the computer with the suitable interface properties for CWND (Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders). The study is the first to test ToM on 2D and 3D virtual environments and include their comparisons. The study is a vital instance to merge the psychology and the computer science disciplines to provide benefits about the developments of learning skills of and interaction with CWND. We believe that the results will give the new ideas for the researchers who study in this area.","authors":["N.
