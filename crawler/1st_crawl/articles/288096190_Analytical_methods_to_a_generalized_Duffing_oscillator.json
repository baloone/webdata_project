{"id":"288096190_Analytical_methods_to_a_generalized_Duffing_oscillator","abstract":"In this paper, Modified Homotopy Perturbation Method (MHPM) and The Max-Min Approach (MMA) are applied to study the generalized Duffing equation. The general solution can be used to yield the relationship between amplitude and frequency in different strengths of nonlinearity. At first the basic concepts of these methods are explained, application of solution procedure illustrated in both modified homotopy perturbation method and the max-min approach and finally the obtained results are compared with exact integration solution. The advantages of using these methods are high accuracy and simple procedure in comparison to exact solution.","authors":["Mofid Gorji-Bandpy","M.
