{"id":"260586809_Rendezvous_of_mobile_agents_with_constrained_energy_and_intermittent_communication","abstract":"This study addresses the rendezvous problem for networks of mobile agents with limited energy and intermittent communication. An energy-aware rendezvous protocol is developed which can prevent the agents from depleting their energy. Moreover, the agents with the least energy among their neighbours are allowed to remain static to conserve energy under the proposed protocol. A necessary condition and a sufficient condition are also derived for achieving rendezvous. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the main results.","authors":["Caixia Song","Gang Feng","Y.
