{"id":"261066162_Random_Matrices_and_Erasure_Robust_Frames","abstract":"Data erasure can often occur in communication. Guarding against erasures\ninvolves redundancy in data representation. Mathematically this may be achieved\nby redundancy through the use of frames. One way to measure the robustness of a\nframe against erasures is to examine the worst case condition number of the\nframe with a certain number of vectors erased from the frame. The term {\\em\nnumerically erasure-robust frames (NERFs)} was introduced in \\cite{FicMix12} to\ngive a more precise characterization of erasure robustness of frames. In the\npaper the authors established that random frames whose entries are drawn\nindependently from the standard normal distribution can be robust against up to\napproximately 15\\% erasures, and asked whether there exist frames that are\nrobust against erasures of more than 50\\%. In this paper we show that with very\nhigh probability random frames are, independent of the dimension, robust\nagainst any amount of erasures as long as the number of remaining vectors is at\nleast $1+\\delta$ times the dimension for some $\\delta_0>0$. This is the best\npossible result, and it also implies that the proportion of erasures can\narbitrarily close to 1 while still maintaining robustness. Our result depends\ncrucially on a new estimate for the smallest singular value of a rectangular\nrandom matrix with independent standard normal entries.","authors":["Yang Wang"],"meta":["February 2018Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications 24(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00041-016-9486-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["225994233_Equal-Norm_Tight_Frames_with_Erasures","222565757_Grassmannian_Frames_with_Applications_to_Coding_and_Communication","222532215_Optimal_frames_for_erasures","312919385_Eigenvalues_and_condition_numbers_of_random_matrices","255614882_Quantized_Frame_Expansions_with_Erasures_1","231513148_Group-theoretic_constructions_of_erasure-robust_frames","224513791_A_Simple_Proof_of_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property_for_Random_Matrices","222700497_Frame_expansions_with_erasures_An_approach_through_the_non-commutative_operator_theory","221665540_Numerically_erasure-robust_frames","220685215_Near-Optimal_Signal_Recovery_From_Random_Projections_Universal_Encoding_Strategies","220481360_Phase_Retrieval_via_Matrix_Completion","200524187_The_restricted_isometry_property_and_its_implications_for_compressed_sensing","47758386_Introduction_to_the_non-asymptotic_analysis_of_random_matrices","45906377_Non-asymptotic_Theory_of_Random_Matrices_Extreme_Singular_Values","37601702_Eigenvalues_and_Condition_Numbers_of_Random_Matrices"]}
