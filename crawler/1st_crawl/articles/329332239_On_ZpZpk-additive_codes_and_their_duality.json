{"id":"329332239_On_ZpZpk-additive_codes_and_their_duality","abstract":"In this paper, two different Gray-like maps from $Z_p^\\alpha\\times Z_{p^k}^\\beta$, where $p$ is prime, to $Z_p^n$, $n={\\alpha+\\beta p^{k-1}}$, denoted by $\\phi$ and $\\Phi$, respectively, are presented. We have determined the connection between the weight enumerators among the image codes under these two mappings. We show that if $C$ is a $Z_p Z_{p^k}$-additive code, and $C^\\bot$ is its dual, then the weight enumerators of the image $p$-ary codes $\\phi(C)$ and $\\Phi(C^\\bot)$ are formally dual. This is a partial generalization of [D. S. Krotov, On $Z_{2^k}$-dual binary codes, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 53 (2007), 1532--1537, arXiv:math/0509325], and the result is generalized to odd characteristic $p$ and mixed alphabet. Additionally, a construction of $1$-perfect additive codes in the mixed $Z_p Z_{p^2}... Z_{p^k}$ alphabet is given.","authors":["Minjia Shi","Rongsheng Wu","Denis S Krotov"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2018.2883759"],"references":["322537470_On_mathbbZ_2s-Linear_Hadamard_Codes_kernel_and_partial_classification","275617426_The_Structure_of_Z2Z2s-Additive_Codes_Bounds_on_the_Minimum_Distance","271942872_On_Z_p_r_Z_p_s_-additive_codes","267478982_Z_2_Z_4_-linear_codes_rank_and_kernel","260780408_Z2Z4-linear_codes_generator_matrices_and_duality","257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","267657180_Z_2_Z_4_-additive_perfect_codes_in_steganography","265715837_The_Kerdok_code_in_cyclic_form","265586948_Characterization_and_constructions_of_self-dual_codes_over_Z_2_Z_4","265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory"]}
