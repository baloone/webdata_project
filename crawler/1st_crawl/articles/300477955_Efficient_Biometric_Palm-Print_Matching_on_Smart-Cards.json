{"id":"300477955_Efficient_Biometric_Palm-Print_Matching_on_Smart-Cards","abstract":"Biometrics have been used as a solution for system access control, for many years. However, the simple use of biometrics can not be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are related to the data transmission way between where the users require access and the servers where the biometric data, captured upon registration, are stored. In this paper, the use smart-cards is adopted as a possible solution to this problem. we propose an efficient implementation of palm-print verification for smart-cards. In this implementation, the matching is done on-card. Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner card.","authors":["Rafael Soares Wyant","Nadia Nedjah","Luiza de Macedo Mourelle"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-09153-2_18","Conference: International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications"],"references":["220962911_Biometrics_Access_Control_Smart_Cards_A_Not_So_Simple_Combination","3308596_An_Introduction_to_Biometric_Recognition","245571002_Automated_personal_identification_by_palmprint","224608205_Theory_of_communication_Part_1_The_analysis_of_information","27411112_Online_palmprint_identification","23112221_Ferrier_Lecture_Functional_Architecture_of_Macaque_Monkey_Visual_Cortex","19140456_Uncertainty_relation_for_resolution_in_space_spatial_frequency_and_orientation_optimized_by_two-dimensional_visual_cortical_filters","15732240_Daugman_JG_Two-Dimensional_Spectral_Analysis_of_Cortical_Receptive_Field_Profile_Vision_Research_20_847-856","3192194_High_confidence_visual_recognition_of_persons_by_a_test_of_statistical_independence"]}
