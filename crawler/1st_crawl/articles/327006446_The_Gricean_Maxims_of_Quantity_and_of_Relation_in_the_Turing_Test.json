{"id":"327006446_The_Gricean_Maxims_of_Quantity_and_of_Relation_in_the_Turing_Test","abstract":"Previous research in the field of cognitive science has demonstrated the relevance of measuring reaction times to describe the cognitive cost of processing information, yet it has seldom been studied in the context of conversations and, to our knowledge, never in free flowing, interactive conversations. This study presents a way of analyzing entire online conversations in a protocol inspired by the Turing Test to investigate the relation between violations of Griceâ€™s Cooperation Principle and the response times of the participants. We hypothesized that response times are directly correlated to the cognitive cost required to generate implicatures from a statement. Our results show that violations of the maxim of Relation had an important effect on response time, especially for female participants. This confirms that measuring response times during a conversation can be a simple and relevant way of inferring the cognitive cost of processing an utterance.","authors":["Baptiste Jacquet","Jean Baratgin","Frank Jamet"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1109/HSI.2018.8431328","Conference: 2018 11th International Conference on Human System Interaction (HSI)At: Gdansk, Poland, Poland","Project: Turing test"],"references":["319127909_Evaluating_Natural_Language_Understanding_Services_for_Conversational_Question_Answering_Systems","317722612_End-to-end_joint_learning_of_natural_language_understanding_and_dialogue_manager","311430660_End-to-End_Joint_Learning_of_Natural_Language_Understanding_and_Dialogue_Manager","292814363_Relevance_in_computer-mediated_conversation","241065652_Is_there_a_maxim_of_truthfulness","233013510_Pragmatic_approach_to_decision_making_under_uncertainty_The_case_of_the_disjunction_effect","225971654_The_psychology_of_dynamic_probability_judgment_Order_effect_normative_theory_and_experimental_methodology","45230073_Principles_of_Evaluation_in_Natural_Language_Processing","23459798_Conversation_Effects_on_Neural_Mechanisms_Underlying_Reaction_Time_to_Visual_Events_while_Viewing_a_Driving_Scene_using_MEG","15421059_Integration_of_Visual_and_Linguistic_Information_in_Spoken_Language_Comprehension","14567385_Speed_of_Processing_in_the_Human_Visual_System","12601939_Not_only_base_rates_are_neglected_in_the_Engineer-Lawyer_problem_An_investigation_of_reasoners'_underutilization_of_complementarity","12253916_When_children_are_more_logical_than_adults_Experimental_investigations_of_scalar_implicature","317233958_Noticing_Students'_Conversations_and_Gestures_During_Group_Problem-Solving_in_Mathematics","309186306_Logic_and_conversation","285789753_When_children_are_more_logical_than_adults","279035048_Prosody_conveys_speaker's_intentions_Acoustic_cues_for_speech_act_perception","259703577_Relevance_Communication_Cognition","227799322_A_Global_Developmental_Trend_in_Cognitive_Processing_Speed","226911747_Laws_of_language_use_and_formal_logic","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","223623866_Relevance_theory_explains_the_selection_task","222555021_Pragmatics_in_human-computer_conversations","222523044_The_pragmatics_sentential_coordination_with_and","222413492_Do_speakers_and_listeners_observe_the_Gricean_Maxim_of_Quantity","23753450_Framing_the_Framing_Effect_The_Impact_of_Context_Cues_on_Solutions_to_the_'Asian_Disease'_Problem","20790832_A_Global_Developmental_Trend_in_Cognitive_Processing_Speed","17247568_Cognitive_aspects_of_information_processing_III_Set_for_speed_versus_accuracy","10993022_Eye_movements_and_spoken_language_comprehension_Effects_of_visual_context_on_syntactic_ambiguity_resolution"]}
