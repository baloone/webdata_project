{"id":"338362090_Improved_protein_structure_prediction_using_predicted_interresidue_orientations","abstract":"The prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the “ideality” of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.","authors":["Jianyi Yang","Ivan Anishchenko","Hahnbeom Park","Zhenling Peng"],"meta":["January 2020Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 117(3):201914677","DOI:10.1073/pnas.1914677117"],"references":["334815843_Evaluation_of_model_refinement_in_CASP13","334428525_Prediction_of_inter-residue_contacts_with_DeepMetaPSICOV_in_CASP13","333665901_Protein_contact_prediction_using_metagenome_sequence_data_and_residual_neural_networks","333637097_De_novo_protein_design_by_citizen_scientists","332422388_Protein_tertiary_structure_modeling_driven_by_deep_learning_and_contact_distance_prediction_in_CASP13","330260442_De_novo_design_of_potent_and_selective_mimics_of_IL-2_and_IL-15","327653004_De_novo_design_of_a_fluorescence-activating_b-barrel","325806547_HMMER_web_server_2018_update","307604085_Accurate_De_Novo_Prediction_of_Protein_Contact_Map_by_Ultra-Deep_Learning_Model","256452295_Assessing_the_utility_of_coevolution-based_residue-residue_contact_predictions_in_a_sequence-_and_structure-rich_era","233331722_Principles_for_designing_ideal_protein_structures","51924063_HHblits_Lightning-fast_iterative_protein_sequence_searching_by_HMM-HMM_alignment","40899046_PyRosetta_A_script-based_interface_for_implementing_molecular_modeling_algorithms_using_Rosetta","13529108_Crystallography_NMR_System_A_New_Software_Suite_for_Macromolecular_Structure_Determination","8637283_Protein_structure_prediction_using_ROSETTA","335094411_Distance-based_protein_folding_powered_by_deep_learning","334817195_Deep-learning_contact-map_guided_protein_structure_prediction_in_CASP13","334690023_A_further_leap_of_improvement_in_tertiary_structure_prediction_in_CASP13_prompts_new_routes_for_future_assessments","334590956_High-accuracy_refinement_using_Rosetta_in_CASP13","333782277_Driven_to_Near-Experimental_Accuracy_by_Refinement_via_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations","333001995_ResPRE_High-accuracy_protein_contact_prediction_by_coupling_precision_matrix_with_deep_residual_neural_networks","322277018_Tensorflow_Large-scale_machine_learning_on_heterogeneous_distributed_systems","321317106_Continuous_Automated_Model_Evaluation_CAMEO_Complementing_the_Critical_Assessment_of_Structure_Prediction_in_CASP12","319770252_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","312576672_Protein_structure_determination_using_metagenome_sequence_data","270903100_The_Protein_Data_Bank","11078561_Erratum_Distance-scaled_finite_ideal-gas_reference_state_improves_structure-derived_potentials_of_mean_force_for_structure_selection_and_stability_prediction_Protein_Science_2002_11_2714-2726","8240145_Scoring_function_for_automated_assessment_of_protein_structure_template_quality"]}
