{"id":"263339162_Coefficient_Estimates_for_a_General_Subclass_of_Analytic_and_Bi-Univalent_Functions","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce and investigate an interesting subclass N-Sigma(h,p) (lambda, mu) of analytic and bi-univalent functions in the open unit disk U. For functions belonging to the class N-Sigma(h,p) (lambda, mu), we obtain estimates on the first two Taylor-Maclaurin coefficients |a(2)| and |a(3)|. The results presented in this paper would generalize and improve some recent works of Caglar et al. [3], Xu et al. [10], and other authors.","authors":["Hari Mohan Srivastava","Serap Bulut","Murat ÇAĞLAR","Nihat Yağmur"],"meta":["March 2013Filomat 27:5 (2013)(5):831–842","DOI:10.2298/FIL1305831S"],"references":["279900936_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_class_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","267147453_Estimate_for_initial_Maclaurin_coefficients_of_bi-univalent_functions_for_a_class_defined_by_fractional_derivatives","266599267_Two_new_subclasses_of_bi-univalent_functions","320007235_Coefficient_bounds_for_certain_subclasses_of_bi-univalent_functions","266860526_Coefficient_bounds_for_bi-univalent_functions","266049714_On_some_classes_of_bi-univalent_functions","262304724_Faber_polynomial_coefficient_estimates_for_a_comprehensive_subclass_of_analytic_bi-univalent_functions","257293990_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_certain_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","256936630_A_certain_general_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions_and_associated_coefficient_estimate_problems","256759131_Some_starlikeness_criterions_for_analytic_functions"]}
