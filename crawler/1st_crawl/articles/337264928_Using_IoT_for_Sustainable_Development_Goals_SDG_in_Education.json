{"id":"337264928_Using_IoT_for_Sustainable_Development_Goals_SDG_in_Education","abstract":"Whereas the demand of pure Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) jobs is increasing, young people interested on STEM studies are decreasing. Among the reasons, different studies show that male and female students do not have a clear perception of engineering. Furthermore, there is a very worrying gender gap in fields as Computer Science. The lack of role models, stereotypes and the perception of a machine and programming oriented discipline are pointed out as possible reasons. In order to reverse the situation, this paper presents an ongoing project to be conducted at the early years of high school to connect computer engineering with environment giving the students the idea that computer engineering is not only about programming and giving them real-life applications. Then, the project serves of Internet of Things (IoT) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to propose students a real world problem to face and promote engineering vocations. One of the key aspects of the project is to be directed to young students. This increases the impact in both number of students attending the activity and the possibility that teachers accomplish actions against the gender gap before it is well established.","authors":["Laura Oliva-Maza","Enrique Torres-Moreno","María Villarroya-Gaudó","N.
