{"id":"318407779_Graph_Signal_Recovery_via_Primal-Dual_Algorithms_for_Total_Variation_Minimization","abstract":"We consider the problem of recovering a smooth graph signal from noisy samples taken on a subset of graph nodes. The smoothness of the graph signal is quantified in terms of total variation. We formulate the signal recovery task as a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of the graph signal while controlling its global or node-wise empirical error. We propose a first-order primal-dual algorithm to solve these total variation minimization problems. A distributed implementation of the algorithm is devised to handle large-dimensional applications efficiently. We use synthetic and real-world data to extensively compare the performance of our approach with state-of-the art methods.","authors":["Peter Berger","Gabor Hannak","Gerald Matz"],"meta":["July 2017IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726978"],"references":["308883904_Compressed_Sensing_and_Adaptive_Graph_Total_Variation_for_Tomographic_Reconstructions","303496007_Kernel-Based_Reconstruction_of_Graph_Signals","282402877_Efficient_Sampling_Set_Selection_for_Bandlimited_Graph_Signals_Using_Graph_Spectral_Proxies","280630702_Signals_on_Graphs_Uncertainty_Principle_and_Sampling","279159876_Signal_Recovery_on_Graphs_Variation_Minimization","275210378_Distributed_Algorithm_for_Graph_Signal_Inpainting","274012268_A_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_Sampling_Theory_of_Graph_Signals","273788318_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Sampling_Theory","266971982_Local-Set-Based_Graph_Signal_Reconstruction","265150631_A_General_Framework_for_a_Class_of_First_Order_Primal-Dual_Algorithms_for_TV_Minimization","262231664_Semi-Supervised_Multiresolution_Classification_Using_Adaptive_Graph_Filtering_With_Application_to_Indirect_Bridge_Structural_Health_Monitoring","261344786_Signal_processing_techniques_for_interpolation_in_graph_structured_data","260686281_Gossip_Algorithms_for_Distributed_Signal_Processing","260637730_Perfect_Reconstruction_Two-Channel_Wavelet_Filter_Banks_for_Graph_Structured_Data","257592339_Localized_Iterative_Methods_for_Interpolation_in_Graph_Structured_Data","237054062_Multiclass_Total_Variation_Clustering","232743728_The_Emerging_Field_of_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Extending_High-Dimensional_Data_Analysis_to_Networks_and_Other_Irregular_Domains","232272943_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs","221497344_Kernels_and_Regularization_on_Graphs","220493422_LSQR_An_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Linear_Equations_and_Sparse_Least_Squares","220385725_Nonlocal_Operators_with_Applications_to_Image_Processing","200044306_Opinion_Extraction_Summarization_and_Tracking_in_News_and_Blog_Corpora","323817781_Adaptive_Graph-Based_Total_Variation_for_Tomographic_Reconstructions","312901184_Tikhonov_regularization_and_semi-supervised_learning_on_large_graphs","308744309_Fast_dual_proximal_gradient_algorithms_with_rate_O1k15_for_convex_minimization","305789724_Efficient_Graph_Signal_Recovery_over_Big_Networks","303597151_An_introduction_to_continuous_optimization_for_imaging","302406472_Scalable_Graph_Signal_Recovery_for_Big_Data_Over_Networks","284161422_An_Augmented_ADMM_Algorithm_With_Application_to_the_Generalized_Lasso_Problem","284096844_Random_Sampling_of_Bandlimited_Signals_on_Graphs","275280004_Sampling_of_Graph_Signals_With_Successive_Local_Aggregations","269853837_Proximal_Algorithms","269294777_On_the_convergence_of_average_consensus_with_generalized_metropolis-hasting_weights","264828551_Big_Data_Analysis_with_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Representation_and_processing_of_massive_data_sets_with_irregular_structure","263559970_An_Algorithm_for_Total_Variation_Minimization_and_Applications_Special_Issue_on_Mathematics_and_Image_Analysis","261454906_Big_data_Issues_challenges_tools_and_Good_practices","259118010_A_fast_dual_proximal_gradient_algorithm_for_convex_minimization_and_applications","255608821_ALGORITHMS_FOR_TOTAL_VARIATION_MINIMIZATION","243787569_Introductory_Lectures_on_Convex_Optimization_A_Basic_Course","236736824_An_efficient_primal-dual_hybrid_gradient_algorithm_for_total_variation_image_restoration","236597470_Adaptive_Primal-Dual_Hybrid_Gradient_Methods_for_Saddle-Point_Problems","228345771_Distributed_Average_Consensus_with_Time-Varying_Metropolis_Weights","227856755_Identifying_Influential_and_Susceptible_Members_of_Social_Networks","224750875_Regularization_and_semi-supervised_learning_on_large_graphs","224567393_Fast_Gradient-Based_Algorithms_for_Constrained_Total_Variation_Image_Denoising_and_Deblurring_Problems","222433645_Non-linear_protocols_for_optimal_distributed_consensus_in_networks_of_dynamic_agents","221365268_Weighted_PageRank_Algorithm","220438085_Issue_Publics_on_the_Web_Applying_Network_Theory_to_the_War_Blogosphere","220124383_A_Fast_Iterative_Shrinkage-Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","215601311_Introductory_Lectures_on_Convex_Optimization_A_Basic_Course_Applied_Optimization","24344326_NESTA_A_Fast_and_Accurate_First-order_Method_for_Sparse_Recovery","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","44241018_A_First-Order_Primal-Dual_Algorithm_for_Convex_Problems_with_Applications_to_Imaging","41781562_Semi-Supervised_Learning","23948415_Smooth_minimization_of_non-smooth_functions"]}
