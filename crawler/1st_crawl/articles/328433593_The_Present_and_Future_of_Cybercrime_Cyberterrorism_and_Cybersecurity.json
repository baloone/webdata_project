{"id":"328433593_The_Present_and_Future_of_Cybercrime_Cyberterrorism_and_Cybersecurity","abstract":"Cybercriminology combines knowledge from criminology, psychology, sociology, computer science, and cybersecurity to provide an in-depth understanding of cybercrime. Cybercrime and cybersecurity are interconnected across many places, platforms, and actors. Cybercrime issues are continuously and expeditiously changing and developing, especially with the advent of new technologies. The International Journal of Cybersecurity Intelligence and Cybercrime (IJCIC) aims to contribute to the growing field of cybercriminology and cybersecurity. The IJCIC is eager to work with scholars, policy analysts, practitioners, and others to enhance theory, methods, and practice within cybercrime and cybersecurity at the regional, national, and international levels.","authors":["Kyung-Shick Choi","Claire Lee"],"meta":["August 2018","Project: Cybercrime Project"],"references":["327177424_A_Failure_to_Regulate_The_Demands_and_Dilemmas_of_Tackling_Illegal_Content_and_Behaviour_on_Social_Media_A_Failure_to_Regulate_The_Demands_and_Dilemmas_of_Tackling_Illegal_Content_and_Behavior_on_Soci","321716315_Space_Transition_Theory_of_Cyber_Crimes","238621672_Computer_Crime_Victimization_and_Integrated_Theory_An_Empirical_Assessment","353425445_Spreading_Propaganda_in_Cyberspace_Comparing_Cyber-Resource_Usage_of_Al_Qaeda_and_ISIS","353423955_An_Argument_for_Interdisciplinary_Programs_in_Cybersecurity","353421396_Juvenile_Hackers_An_Empirical_Test_of_Self-Control_Theory_and_Social_Bonding_Theory","285588284_Cyberciminology_and_Digital_Investigation","259253929_The_Causes_of_Delinquency","37703526_A_General_Theory_of_Crime"]}
