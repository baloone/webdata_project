{"id":"234785613_Crisis_and_aftermath","abstract":"During November 1988 the Internet was infected with a worm program that eventually spread to thousands of machines, disrupting normal activities and Internet connectivity for many days. This article examines just how this worm operated. The worm took advantage of some flaws in standard software installed on many UNIX systems. It also took advantage of a mechanism used to simplify the sharing of resources in local area networks. Specific patches for these flaws have been widely circulated in days since the worm program attacked the Internet.","authors":["Eugene Spafford"],"meta":["June 1989Communications of the ACM 32(6):678-687","DOI:10.1145/63526.63527","SourceDBLP"],"references":["279003238_A_Hygiene_Lesson","234832430_Lessons_from_the_UNIX_breakins_at_Stanford","234783120_President's_letter"]}
