{"id":"320148067_An_Enhanced_Learning_Style_Index_Implementation_and_Integration_into_an_Intelligent_and_Adaptive_e-Learning_System","abstract":"Advances and accessibility of Internet services around the world have transformed the traditional classroom learning into web-based e-learning systems. In recent years, designing adaptive e-learning systems has become one of striking topic of discussions in the literature. Additionally, integrating such systems with intelligent and adaptive systems that can measure the learning preferences of the user can enable learners to obtain the most suitable learning objects that might be matched with their learning styles. Moreover, even in the classroom teaching, knowing the learning styles of students can also help teachers to adopt appropriate learning materials for efficient learning. This paper is concerned with the study, implementation, and application of a web-based learning style index. The paper also described a case study on the integration of the learning style index into an adaptive and intelligent e-learning system.","authors":["Mohammed Hamada","Mohammed Hassan"],"meta":["July 2017Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 13(8):4449-4470","DOI:10.12973/eurasia.2017.00940a"],"references":["312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","306432295_A_generic_framework_of_intelligent_adaptive_learning_systems_from_learning_effectiveness_to_training_transfer","302883994_The_Learning_Preferences_of_Digital_Learners_in_K-12_Schools_in_China","228403640_Index_of_Learning_Styles_Questionnaire","224215518_Adaptive_and_Intelligent_Systems_for_Collaborative_Learning_Support_A_Review_of_the_Field","223187051_Development_of_an_adaptive_learning_system_with_two_sources_of_personalization_information","220265800_On_the_Application_of_the_Semantic_Web_Concepts_to_Adaptive_E-learning","3911056_An_Affective_Model_of_Interplay_Between_Emotions_and_Learning_Reengineering_Educational_Pedagogy-Building_a_Learning_Companion","2693708_Methods_and_Techniques_of_Adaptive_Hypermedia","315373156_Recommending_Learning_Peers_for_Collaborative_Learning_through_Social_Network_Sites","313691471_Enhancing_learning_objects_recommendation_using_multi-criteria_recommender_systems","313690917_A_multimedia_learning_environment_for_information_theory","311783501_An_Interactive_Learning_Environment_for_Information_and_Communication_Theory","304295725_Learning_system_and_analysis_of_learning_style_for_African_and_Asian_students","302586778_Yet_another_adaptive_learning_management_system_based_on_Felder_and_Silverman'S_Learning_Styles_and_Mashup","302578582_Online_Learning_Era_Exploring_the_Most_Decisive_Determinants_of_MOOCs_in_Taiwanese_Higher_Education","301609600_Role_of_learning_style_preferences_and_interactive_response_systems_on_student_learning_outcomes","292473736_Cognitive-conative-affective_processes_in_aptitude_learning_and_instruction_An_introduction","290553608_Effects_of_Cooperative_E-Learning_on_Learning_Outcomes","286124759_An_Evaluation_of_Gas_Law_WebQuest_Based_on_Active_Learning_Style_in_a_Secondary_School_in_Malaysia","284367628_Pervasive_Knowledge_Social_Networks_and_Cloud_Computing_E-Learning_20","283342336_Learning_Environments_Designed_According_to_Learning_Styles_and_Its_Effects_on_Mathematics_Achievement","269824537_Design_and_Assessment_of_Joyful_Mobile_Navigation_Systems_based_on_TAM_and_Integrating_Learning_Models_Applied_on_Ecological_Teaching_Activity","264738078_Implementing_a_New_Approach_for_the_Design_of_an_E-Learning_Platform_in_Engineering_Education","259308976_The_design_and_implementation_of_knowledge_management_systems_and_e-learning_for_improved_occupational_health_and_safety_in_small_to_medium_sized_enterprises_A_Floyde_G_Lawson_S_Shalloe_1_R_Eastgate_2","247702234_Teaching_Through_Modality_Strengths_Concepts_and_Practices","246670283_Learning_Styles_And_Pedagogy_In_Post-16_Learning_A_Systematic_And_Critical_Review","243781107_Learning_style_An_overview","232586344_Relationships_among_learning_styles_instructional_methods_and_the_nature_of_learning_experiences","225508617_Development_and_Use_of_the_ARCS_Model_of_Instructional_Design","222347195_Our_flexible_friend_The_implications_of_individual_differences_for_information_technology_teaching","220143724_An_Integrated_Virtual_Environment_for_Active_and_Collaborative_e-Learning_in_Theory_of_Computation","3622272_Addressing_diverse_learning_styles_through_the_use_of_multimedia"]}
