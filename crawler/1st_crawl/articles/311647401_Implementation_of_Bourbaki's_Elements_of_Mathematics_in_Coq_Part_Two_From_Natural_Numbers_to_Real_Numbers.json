{"id":"311647401_Implementation_of_Bourbaki's_Elements_of_Mathematics_in_Coq_Part_Two_From_Natural_Numbers_to_Real_Numbers","abstract":"This paper describes a formalization of the first book of the series ``Elements of Mathematics'' by Nicolas Bourbaki, using the Coq proof assistant. In a first paper published in this journal, we presented the axioms and basic constructions (corresponding to a part of the first two chapters of book I, theory of sets). We discuss here the set of integers (third chapter of book I, theory of set), the sets Z and Q (first chapter of book II, Algebra) and the set of real numbers (Chapter 4 of book III, General topology). We start with a comparison of the Bourbaki approach, the Coq standard library, and the Ssreflect library, then present our implementation.","authors":["Jos√© Grimm"],"meta":["December 2016Journal of Formalized Reasoning 9(2)","DOI:10.6092/issn.1972-5787/4771"],"references":["280790424_Fibonacci_numbers_and_the_Stern-Brocot_tree_in_Coq","302307679_More_About_the_Function_fusc_A_Sequel_to_EWD570","278776661_Formalization_of_Real_Analysis_A_Survey_of_Proof_Assistants_and_Libraries","268896375_Contributions_to_the_founding_of_the_theory_of_transfinite_numbers_Translated_by_P_E_B_Jourdain","265366028_Elements_of_mathematics_Theory_of_sets","258454133_Construction_of_Real_Algebraic_Numbers_in_Coq","243107522_Uber_eine_zahlentheoretische_Funktion","220658012_Exact_arithmetic_on_the_Stern-Brocot_tree","50333958_Elements_de_mathematique_theorie_des_ensembles","50332248_Elements_of_mathematics_algebra"]}
