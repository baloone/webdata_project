{"id":"303028642_Requirements_Analysis_for_Context-oriented_Systems","abstract":"Context-oriented systems are systems that observe and handle context information from the environment to guide their own behavior. Engineering such systems represents a complex task not only due to their complexity, but also due to the notion of context. Handling this notion involves tackling several challenges, demanding to system designers a certain knowledge and expertise about this notion. In order to help designers on this engineering process, we propose in this paper a roadmap on context management and a requirements elicitation process. This roadmap aims at sharing with non-expert designers the necessary expertise on context management allowing them to better understand the notion of context and its challenges. The elicitation process aims at guiding these non-expert designers across the roadmap, supporting them in their requirements elicitation process concerning context management. The proposal is presented on a running example that illustrates the approach.","authors":["Manuele Kirsch Pinheiro","Ra√∫l Mazo","Carine Souveyet","Danillo Sprovieri"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Computer Science 83:253-261","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2016.04.123"],"references":["317447415_Towards_a_Requirements_Specification_Multi-View_Framework_for_Self-Adaptive_Systems","279258418_Ontology-Based_Resource_Discovery_in_Pervasive_Collaborative_Environments","278798270_Unified_and_Conceptual_Context_Analysis_in_Ubiquitous_Environments","265466879_Towards_a_Requirements_Specification_Multi-View_Framework_for_Self-Adaptive_Systems","262879172_Enabling_Self-learning_in_Dynamic_and_Open_IoT_Environments","259231285_Using_Constraint_Programming_to_Manage_Configurations_in_Self-Adaptive_Systems","248203633_Understanding_and_Using_Context_Personal_and_Ubiquitous_Computing_Journal","262236049_Building_ubiquitous_QoC-aware_applications_through_model-driven_software_engineering","261327710_Resource_discovery_mechanisms_in_grid_systems_A_survey","257660217_Middleware_for_pervasive_computing_A_survey_Pervasive_Mobile_Computing_92_177-200","244231610_Towards_Reasoning_About_Context_in_the_Presence_of_Uncertainty","241258069_An_Architecture_for_Context_Prediction","234810124_Semantic_representation_of_context_models_A_framework_for_analyzing_and_understanding","230758376_Context_Modeling_Context_as_a_Dressing_of_a_Focus","230627476_A_Survey_of_Context_Data_Distribution_for_Mobile_Ubiquitous_Systems"]}
