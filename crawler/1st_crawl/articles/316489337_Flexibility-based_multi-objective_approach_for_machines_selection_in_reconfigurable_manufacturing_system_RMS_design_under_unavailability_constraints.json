{"id":"316489337_Flexibility-based_multi-objective_approach_for_machines_selection_in_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system_RMS_design_under_unavailability_constraints","abstract":"The reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) is a recent manufacturing paradigm driven by the high responsiveness and performance efficiencies. In such system, machines, material handling units or machines components can be added, modified, removed or interchanged as needed. Hence, the design of RMS is based on reconfigurable machines capabilities and product specification. This paper addresses the problem of machines selections for RMS design under unavailability constraints and aims to develop an approach to ensure the best process plan according to the customised flexibility required to produce all parts of a given product. More specifically, we develop a flexibility-based multi-objective approach using an adapted version of the well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to select adequate machines from a set of candidate (potential) ones, in order to ensure the best responsiveness of the designed system in case of unavailability of one of the selected machines. The responsiveness is based on the flexibility of the designed system and a generated process plan, which guarantees the management of machines unavailability. It is defined as the ability and the capacity to adapt the process plan in response to machines unavailability. Two objectives are considered, respectively, the maximisation of the flexibility index of the system and the minimisation of the total completion time. To choose the best solution in the Pareto front, a multi-objective decision-making method called technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is used. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, a simple example is presented and the numerical results are analysed.","authors":["Hichem Haddou Benderbal","Mohammed Dahane","Lyes
