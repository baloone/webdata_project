{"id":"286208470_Good_Quality_Discussion_is_Necessary_but_Not_Sufficient_in_Asynchronous_Tuition_A_Brief_Narrative_Review_of_the_Literature","abstract":"The growth of online learning within education has corresponded to an increase in use of asynchronous discussion. Asynchronous discussion is a form of interaction that is mediated rather than directed, and is characterized by a time lag in the interactions between discussants. In this paper we conducted a brief narrative review of the literature on asynchronous discussion. We argue, initially, that discussion is necessary, but not sufficient, for successful pedagogic outcomes-especially in the case of online learning. We identified areas of agreement within the literature on what can be considered the key factors for successful asynchronous discussion.","authors":["William Fear","Andrew Erikson-Brown"],"meta":["June 2014Journal of Asynchronous Learning Network 18(2)","DOI:10.24059/olj.v18i2.399"],"references":["267978240_Blended_Course_Design_A_Synthesis_of_Best_Practices","248580777_The_Design_and_Sequencing_of_eLearning_InteractionsA_Grounded_Approach","293030962_Providing_service_innovations_to_students_inside_and_outside_of_the_online_classroom_Focusing_on_student_success","292717996_Designs_management_tactics_and_strategies_in_asynchronous_learning_discussions","288802319_What_Do_Unsuccessful_Online_Students_Want_Us_To_Know","286535995_Interpersonal_interaction_in_online_learning_Experienced_online_instructors'_perceptions_of_influencing_factors","284309582_Models_to_evaluate_online_learning_communities_of_asynchronous_discussion_forums","279552798_Interaction_in_an_Asynchronous_Online_Course_a_Synthesis_of_Quantitative_Predictors","273793982_Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Communication_in_an_Online_Environment_Faculty_Experiences_and_Perceptions","259521148_The_relationships_between_higher_order_thinking_skills_cognitive_density_and_social_presence_in_online_learning"]}
