{"id":"282380648_Radar_tasks_scheduling_for_a_multifunction_phased_array_radar_with_hard_time_constraint_and_priority","abstract":"This paper presents the radar tasks scheduling problem for a set of tasks called Hard Time Constraint tasks which cannot delay their processing by more than a positive constant Î± and for a set of tasks called Soft Time Constraint tasks which can be processed at any time. For this problem, we present a method composed of an algorithm which sequence HTC tasks; composed of an heuristic which sequence STC tasks and composed of a selection rule in order to determine which task has to be scheduled between the first task of both sequences.","authors":["Vincent Jeauneau","Frederic Barbaresco","Thomas Guenais"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1109/RADAR.2014.7060250","Project: Radar Resource Management"],"references":["282287542_Phased_array_radar_resource_management_using_continuous_double_auction","295706845_Tracking_and_control_in_multi-function_radar","286820001_Scheduling_on_a_fixed_multifunction_radar_antenna_with_hard_time_constraint","260630301_Scheduling_for_multifunction_radar_via_two-slope_benefit_functions","255731228_Search_Optimization_for_Minimum_Load_under_Detection_Performance_Constraints_in_Multifunction_Radars","245124295_Knapsack-like_scheduling_problems_the_Moore-Hodgson_algorithm_and_the_'tower_of_sets'_property","242929706_One-Processor_Scheduling_with_Symmetric_Earliness_and_Tardiness_Penalties","238514003_Intelligent_multi-mission_radar_resources_management","224320718_A_survey_of_radar_resource_management_algorithms","220121311_Multifunction_Radar_Task_Scheduling","4758214_Scheduling_for_a_multifunction_phased_array_radar_system","4050319_Intelligent_Radar_Management_by_advanced_beamscheduling_algorithms_based_on_short-time_planning_constraints_relaxation","3718271_Resource_Management_For_A_Rotating_Multi-function_Radar","3595832_Optimal_radar_pulse_scheduling_using_a_neural_network","3480425_Comparison_of_scheduling_algorithms_for_multifunction_radar"]}
