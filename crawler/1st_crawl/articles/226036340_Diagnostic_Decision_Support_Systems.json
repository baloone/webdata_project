{"id":"226036340_Diagnostic_Decision_Support_Systems","abstract":"Since primeval times, mankind has attempted to explain natural phenomena using models. For the past four decades, a new kind\nof modeler, the healthcare informatician, has developed and proliferated a new kind of model, the Clinical Diagnostic Decision\nSupport System (DDSS). Modeling historically was, and still remains, an inexact science. Ptolemy, in the “Almagest,” placed\nthe earth at the center of the universe and could still explain why the sun would rise in the east each morning. Newton’s\nnonrelativistic formulation of the laws of mechanics works well for earth-bound engineering applications. Past and present\nDDSS incorporate inexact models of the incompletely understood and exceptionally complex process of clinical diagnosis. Yet\nmankind, using imperfect models, has built machines that fly, and has cured many diseases. Because DDSS augment the natural\ncapabilities of human diagnosticians, they have the potential to be employed productively.1","authors":["Randolph A.
