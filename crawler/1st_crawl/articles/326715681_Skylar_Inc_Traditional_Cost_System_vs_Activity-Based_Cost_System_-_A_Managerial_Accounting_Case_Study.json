The case focuses on the application of activity-based costing in assigning costs to activity cost pools, calculating activity rates, and assigning activity costs to cost objects. It also highlights the difference between the traditional cost system and ABC in regards to allocating manufacturing and non-manufacturing overhead costs and assigning direct costs to products. This case is designed to provide students with both number crunching exercises and theoretical discussions of the topics.","authors":["Qianyun (Ivy) Huang"],"meta":["July 2018Applied Finance and Accounting 4(2):55","DOI:10.11114/afa.v4i2.3496"],"references":["318352613_Competitive_Price_Strategy_with_Activity-Based_Costing_-_Case_Study_of_Bicycle_Part_Company","313720164_The_rise_of_activity-based_costing_-_part_four_what_do_activity-based_cost_systems_look_like","312751748_The_rise_of_activity-based_costing_-_Part_two_When_do_I_need_an_activity-based_cost_system","309645420_Time-Driven_Activity-Based_Costing_for_Surgical_Episodes","284237687_Profit_priorities_from_activity-baced_costing","277551254_Managerial_Accounting","247980922_The_Rise_of_Activity_Based_Costing-Part_One_What_is_an_Activity-Based_Cost_System","247159552_Measure_Cost_Right_Make_the_Right_Decisions"]}
