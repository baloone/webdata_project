{"id":"305986291_Class-Oriented_Model_Graph_Design_Based_on_Abstract_Syntax_Tree","abstract":"Software model graph might play an important role in the representation of software system. To achieve this, essential initial works are found in the literature. For instance, construction of the model graph for software system includes different types of classes and their relationships between the classes. It is now essential to find a system such that it will be possible to implement model graph to visualize a software system or software design. In this paper, proposes an approach for constructing of a class-oriented model graph and analyzing source code using abstract syntax tree. This approach recovers the high-level structure of software architectures solidly from source code to produce a Class-Oriented (software) Model Graph. The obtained model graph will endow with profoundly understanding of relations between the classes while compared with Unified Modeling Language class diagram","authors":["Muttipati Appala Srinuvasu"],"meta":["August 2016INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING 7(2)","DOI:10.090592/IJCSC.2016.126"],"references":["262395668_Tool_for_generating_code_metrics_for_C_source_code_using_abstract_syntax_tree_technique","221307490_Clone_Detection_Using_Abstract_Syntax_Trees","237106818_The_Unified_Modeling_Language_User_Guide"]}
