{"id":"304925118_Analysis_of_Factors_Affecting_Achievement_in_Maker_Programming_Education_in_the_Age_of_Wireless_Communication","abstract":"Since 2010 countries around the world have been emphasizing the importance of informatics education based on computer science rather than ICT use. Korea devised an informatics curriculum that emphasizes SW education as part of its revised curriculum of 2015. The purpose of this study is to examine the factors affecting SW education achievement before implementation of the curriculum so that the revised curriculum could be efficiently established in schools. SW education was provided for 4221 elementary school students, and the factors affecting academic achievement were extracted. The results of the study showed that the achievement level of female students was higher than that of male students, and the level of understanding increased in higher grades. It was found that satisfaction with overall SW education influenced academic achievement. That is, the more satisfied students were with the key factors, such as the infrastructure required for providing SW education and interaction among teachers and students during class time, the higher the level of satisfaction. This study intended to find the key factors necessary for helping SW education take root in schools.","authors":["SeungJin Lee","Jamee Kim","Wongyu Lee"],"meta":["March 2017Wireless Personal Communications 93(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-016-3450-2"],"references":["317644295_Title_Computational_thinking_practices_Analyzing_and_modeling_a_critical_domain_in_computer_science_education","286707679_Development_of_State-Based_Squeak_and_an_Examination_of_Its_Effect_on_Robot_Programming_Education","272017037_An_Integrated_Teaching_and_Learning_Assistance_System_Meeting_Requirements_for_Smart_Education","265797241_New_frameworks_for_studying_and_assessing_the_development_of_computational_thinking","234812396_Education_Paving_the_way_for_computational_thinking","278694075_Imagining_Creating_Playing_Sharing_Reflecting_How_Online_Community_Supports_Young_People_as_Designers_of_Interactive_Media","266653457_CS4Impact_measuring_computational_thinking_concepts_present_in_CS4HS_participant_lesson_plans","257675929_Problem_Based_Learning_PBL_for_Engineering_Education_in_India_Need_and_Recommendations","257675926_The_First_Year_Nursing_Students'_Achievement_and_Critical_Thinking_in_Local_Wisdom_Course_Using_Problem_Based_Learning_Process","257675539_Campus_View_An_Innovative_Location_and_Context-Aware_Video_Sharing_Application_on_Smart_Phone"]}
