{"id":"326420532_Grating-Assisted_Fiber_to_Chip_Coupling_for_SOI_Photonic_Circuits","abstract":"Fiber to chip coupling is a critical aspect of any integrated photonic circuit. In terms of ease of fabrication as well as wafer-scale testability, surface grating couplers are by far the most preferred scheme of the coupling to integrated circuits. In the past decade, considerable effort has been made for designing efficient grating couplers on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) and other allied photonic platforms. Highly efficient grating couplers with sub-dB coupling performance have now been demonstrated. In this article, we review the recent advances made to develop grating coupler designs for a variety of applications on SOI platform. We begin with a basic overview of design methodology involving both shallow etched gratings and the emerging field of subwavelength gratings. The feasibility of reducing footprint by way of incorporating compact tapers is also explored. We also discuss novel grating designs like polarization diversity as well as dual band couplers. Lastly, a brief description of various packaging and wafer-scale testing schemes available for fiber-chip couplers is elaborated.","authors":["Siddharth Nambiar","Purnima Sethi","Shankar Kumar Selvaraja"],"meta":["July 2018Applied Sciences 8(7):1142","DOI:10.3390/app8071142"],"references":["324595278_Integrating_photonics_with_silicon_nanoelectronics_for_the_next_generation_of_systems_on_a_chip","323684948_Multidimensional_quantum_entanglement_with_large-scale_integrated_optics","319271776_Multipurpose_silicon_photonics_signal_processor_core","316679905_Ultra-compact_low-loss_broadband_waveguide_taper_in_silicon-on-insulator","323378989_Compact_broadband_taper_for_low-loss_coupling_to_a_silicon_nitride_photonic_wire","322845797_High-efficiency_broad-bandwidth_subwavelength_grating-based_fiber-chip_coupler_in_silicon-on-insulator","320825174_Compact_tapers_for_silicon_grating_fibre-chip_couplers_in_O_C_and_L_band","317843312_Dual-etch_apodised_grating_couplers_for_efficient_fibre-chip_coupling_near_1310_nm_wavelength","311766850_Photonic_Packaging_Transforming_Silicon_Photonic_Integrated_Circuits_into_Photonic_Devices","303802038_Single-etch_subwavelength_engineered_fiber-chip_grating_couplers_for_13_m_datacom_wavelength_band"]}
