{"id":"291229445_Which_tone-mapping_operator_is_the_best_A_comparative_study_of_perceptual_quality","abstract":"Tone-mapping operators (TMO) are designed to generate perceptually similar\nlow-dynamic range images from high-dynamic range ones. We studied the\nperformance of fifteen TMOs in two psychophysical experiments where observers\ncompared the digitally generated tone-mapped images to their corresponding\nphysical scenes. All experiments were performed in a controlled environment and\nthe setups were designed to emphasise different image properties: in the first\nexperiment we evaluated the local relationships among intensity-levels, and in\nthe second one we evaluated global visual appearance among physical scenes and\ntone-mapped images, which were presented side by side. We ranked the TMOs\naccording to how well they reproduce the results obtained in the physical\nscene. Our results show that ranking position clearly depends on the adopted\nevaluation criteria, which implies that, in general, these tone-mapping\nalgorithms consider either local or global image attributes but rarely both. We\nconclude that a more thorough and standardized evaluation criteria are needed\nto study all the characteristics of TMOs, as there is ample room for\nimprovement in future developments.","authors":["Xim Cerda-Company","C.
