{"id":"262522734_Innovation_and_Design_Approaches_within_Prospective_Ergonomics","abstract":"In this conceptual article the topic of “Prospective Ergonomics” will be discussed within the context of innovation, design thinking and design processes & methods. Design thinking is essentially a human-centred innovation process that emphasises observation, collaboration, interpretation, visualisation of ideas, rapid concept prototyping and concurrent business analysis, which ultimately influences innovation and business strategy. The objective of this project is to develop a roadmap for innovation, involving consumers, designers and business people in an integrative process, which can be applied to product, service and business design. A theoretical structure comprising of Innovation perspectives (1), Worldviews supported by rationalist-historicist and empirical-idealistic dimensions (2) and Models of “design” reasoning (3) precedes the development and classification of existing methods as well as the introduction of new ones.","authors":["Eric Brangier","André Liem"],"meta":["February 2012Work 41(1):5243-5250","DOI:10.3233/WOR-2012-0013-5243","Project: Prospective ergonomics"],"references":["288393685_The_Innovation_Pyramid_A_Categorization_of_the_Innovation_Phenomenon_in_the_Product-design_Field","270639013_Bottom-Up_Building_of_an_Innovative_Organization","242709879_Ideation_for_Product_Innovation_What_are_the_Best_Methods","285953688_User_Value_Competing_Theories_and_Models","262179151_Human_Problem_Solving","252063854_The_PDMA_Toolbook_for_New_Product_Development","251880127_Wicked_Problems_in_Design_Thinking","249563009_A_Social_Model_of_Design_Issues_of_Practice_and_Research","245678054_Co-Opting_Customer_Competence","243782913_Third_Generation_RD_-_Managing_The_Link_to_Corporate_Strategy"]}
