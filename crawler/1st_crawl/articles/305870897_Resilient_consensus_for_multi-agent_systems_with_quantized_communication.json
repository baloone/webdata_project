{"id":"305870897_Resilient_consensus_for_multi-agent_systems_with_quantized_communication","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the resilient consensus problem for multi-agent systems with quantized communication. We assume that each agent in the network can only exchange quantized information with its neighbors. A novel quantized-data based secure control law with built-in security mechanism is proposed to achieve consensus in the presence of attack agents. It is shown that for a directed network, as long as the number of attack nodes is bounded in each nodeâ€™ neighborhood, the consensus can be achieved with a given sufficient network connectivity. Finally, we offer a numerical example to demonstrate the validity of the derived results.","authors":["Yiming Wu","Xiongxiong He","Shuai Liu"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1109/ACC.2016.7526474","Conference: 2016 American Control Conference (ACC)","Project: Security of industrial control systems"],"references":["265691583_Distributed_Fault_Detection_and_Isolation_Resilient_to_Network_Model_Uncertainties","263449273_Consensus_of_discrete-time_multi-agent_systems_with_adversaries_and_time_delays","312890364_Consensus_seeking_in_multi-agent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","284661956_Consensus_seeking_in_multi-agent_systems_using_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies","274196548_Consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_in_the_presence_of_locally_bounded_faults","267102975_Resilient_Distributed_Control_in_the_Presence_of_Misbehaving_Agents_in_Networked_Control_Systems","262938431_A_Reputation-Based_Secure_Distributed_Control_Methodology_in_D-NCS","262390230_Continuous-time_and_sampled-data-based_average_consensus_with_logarithmic_quantizers","257827547_Resilient_Asymptotic_Consensus_in_Robust_Networks"]}
