{"id":"318305770_The_Tightly_Super_2-extra_Connectivity_and_2-extra_Diagnosability_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","abstract":"Connectivity plays an important role in measuring the fault tolerance of an interconnection network G = (V, E). A faulty set F ⊆ V is called a g-extra faulty set if every component of G - F has more than g nodes. A g-extra cut of G is a g-extra faulty set F such that G - F is disconnected. The minimum cardinality of g-extra cuts is said to be the g-extra connectivity of G. G is super g-extra connected if every minimum g-extra cut F of G isolates one connected subgraph of order g + 1. If, in addition, G - F has two components, one of which is the connected subgraph of order g + 1, then G is tightly |F| super g-extra connected. Diagnosability is an important metric for measuring the reliability of G. A new measure for fault diagnosis of G restrains that every fault-free component has at least (g + 1) fault-free nodes, which is called the g-extra diagnosability of G. The locally twisted cube LTQn is applied widely. In this paper, it is proved that LTQn is tightly (3n - 5) super 2-extra connected for n ≥ 5, and the 2-extra diagnosability of LTQn is 3n - 3 under the PMC model (n ≥ 5) and MM∗ model (n ≥ 6).","authors":["YUNXIA REN","SHIYING WANG"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Interconnection Networks 17(2)","DOI:10.1142/S0219265917500062"],"references":["276489006_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_the_Locally_Twisted_Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model","273523144_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model_and_MM_Model","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","308532539_h-restricted_connectivity_of_locally_twisted_cubes","305749910_The_2-Extra_Connectivity_and_2-Extra_Diagnosability_of_Bubble-Sort_Star_Graph_Networks","301248292_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","295254875_G-Good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_3-ary_n-cube_networks","287148222_23-Restricted_Connectivity_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","273490370_The_g_-extra_conditional_diagnosability_and_sequential_t_k_-diagnosability_of_hypercubes","221132175_The_Diagnosability_of_g-good-neighbor_Conditional-Faulty_Hypercube_under_PMC_Model","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3048452_An_0n25_Fault_Identification_Algorithm_for_Diagnosable_Systems"]}
