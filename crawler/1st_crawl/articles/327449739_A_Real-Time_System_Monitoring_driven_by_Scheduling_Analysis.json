{"id":"327449739_A_Real-Time_System_Monitoring_driven_by_Scheduling_Analysis","abstract":"Real-Time system engineers may introduce task scheduling analysis at the early stage of the design process. System temporal behavior and task schedules are strongly related. The noncompliance to an expected schedule is a symptom of an erroneous state that may result in a serious risk for the system integrity. Spreading the design task model, as a timing reference to guide run-time verification, is a kind of extension to the model driven design paradigm. This paper presents the overall architecture of a nonintrusive hybrid monitor. Configured by the result of a scheduling simulation, the monitor is intended to observe the system execution and raised an alarm in case of divergence with the predicted schedule. To advance this goal, a first experiment shows the scheduling of 2 tasks rebuilt from the events collected by the monitor while the RTEMS OS' scheduler was executing.","authors":["Stéphane Rubini","Valerie-Anne Nicolas","Frank Singhoff","José Rufino"],"meta":["December 2018Ada User Journal 39(4):282-286","Project: Project Cheddar,  a  tool for real-time scheduling analysis"],"references":["296467453_Run-Time_Monitoring_of_Timing_Constraints_A_Survey_of_Methods_and_Tools","235077559_The_Architecture_Analysis_Design_Language_AADL_An_Introduction","234827571_Cheddar_A_Flexible_Real_Time_Scheduling_Framework","3188210_Requirements-based_monitors_for_real-time_systems","267707883_Microcontroller_Assembly_Synthesis_from_Timed_Automaton_Task_Specifications","262335191_Scheduling_and_thread_management_with_RTEMS","220762683_The_Flight_Recorder_An_Architectural_Aid_for_System_Monitoring","3187265_Noninterference_monitoring_and_replay_mechanism_for_real-time_software_testing_and_debugging"]}
