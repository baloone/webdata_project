{"id":"339650468_DC-SPP-YOLO_Dense_connection_and_spatial_pyramid_pooling_based_YOLO_for_object_detection","abstract":"Although the YOLOv2 method is extremely fast on object detection, its detection accuracy is restricted due to the low performance of its backbone network and the under-utilization of multi-scale region features. Therefore, a dense connection (DC) and spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) based YOLO (DC-SPP-YOLO) method is proposed in this paper for ameliorating the object detection accuracy of YOLOv2. Specifically, the backbone network of YOLOv2 adopts the dense connection of convolution layers, which strengthen the feature extraction and alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem. Moreover, an improved spatial pyramid pooling is introduced to pool and concatenate the multi-scale region features, so that the network learns the object features more comprehensively. The DC-SPP-YOLO model is established and trained based on a new loss function composed of MSE (mean square error) loss and cross-entropy loss. The experimental results indicate that the mAP (mean Average Precision) of DC-SPP-YOLO is higher than that of YOLOv2 on the PASCAL VOC datasets and the UA-DETRAC datasets. The effectiveness of DC-SPP-YOLO method proposed is demonstrated.","authors":["Zhanchao Huang","Jianlin Wang","Xuesong Fu","Tao Yu"],"meta":["March 2020Information Sciences 522(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2020.02.067"],"references":["332814133_Enhancement_of_SSD_by_concatenating_feature_maps_for_object_detection","319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","318487976_Residual_Features_and_Unified_Prediction_Network_for_Single_Stage_Detection","316432841_Arbitrary-Oriented_Scene_Text_Detection_via_Rotation_Proposals","316184205_MobileNets_Efficient_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Mobile_Vision_Applications","312759848_DSSD_Deconvolutional_Single_Shot_Detector","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","301878495_SqueezeNet_AlexNet-level_accuracy_with_50x_fewer_parameters_and_05MB_model_size","286513835_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","277411157_Deep_Learning","221362642_Boosted_local_structured_HOG-LBP_for_object_localization","332692870_Proposal_Pyramid_Networks_for_Fast_Face_Detection","329748420_Scale-Transferrable_Object_Detection","329743881_R-FCN-3000_at_30fps_Decoupling_Detection_and_Classification","324423720_Feature-fused_SSD_fast_detection_for_small_objects","324387691_YOLOv3_An_Incremental_Improvement","322592076_Extend_the_shallow_part_of_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector_via_Convolutional_Neural_Network","322376340_Advanced_Deep-Learning_Techniques_for_Salient_and_Category-Specific_Object_Detection_A_Survey","321719027_Weaving_Multi-scale_Context_for_Single_Shot_Detector","321180477_Light-Head_R-CNN_In_Defense_of_Two-Stage_Object_Detector","320968382_Xception_Deep_Learning_with_Depthwise_Separable_Convolutions","320967941_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_Stronger","320653986_UA-DETRAC_2017_Report_of_AVSS2017_IWT4S_Challenge_on_Advanced_Traffic_Monitoring","320634179_Geometric_proposals_for_faster_R-CNN","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319575218_Evolving_boxes_for_fast_vehicle_detection","318205093_ShuffleNet_An_Extremely_Efficient_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Mobile_Devices","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","311609043_Exploit_All_the_Layers_Fast_and_Accurate_CNN_Object_Detector_with_Scale_Dependent_Pooling_and_Cascaded_Rejection_Classifiers","311573567_Feature_Pyramid_Networks_for_Object_Detection","308277265_A_Unified_Multi-scale_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Fast_Object_Detection","303409473_R-FCN_Object_Detection_via_Region-based_Fully_Convolutional_Networks","301874967_Inception-v4_Inception-ResNet_and_the_Impact_of_Residual_Connections_on_Learning","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","285648386_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","283335151_Scale-aware_Fast_R-CNN_for_Pedestrian_Detection","280329704_Training_Very_Deep_Networks","277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","275669302_Fast_r-cnn","272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","262351604_Data_Decomposition_and_Spatial_Mixture_Modeling_for_Part_Based_Model","45200127_Object_Detection_with_Discriminatively_Trained_Part-Based_Models"]}
