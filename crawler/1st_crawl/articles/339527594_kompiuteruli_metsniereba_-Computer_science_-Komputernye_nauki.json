{"id":"339527594_kompiuteruli_metsniereba_-Computer_science_-Komputernye_nauki","abstract":"In order to conduct geological or environmental research, it is often necessary to know the value of a variable over the entire study area, but for some reason it is impossible to take samples at some points and therefore, we cannot determine any variable parameters in these areas. To draw conclusions we need a full range of data. In this case, to determine the value of any variables at the point where it is not calculated, we use spatial interpolation. There are various interpolation methods. For conducting spatial analysis, geographic information system programs have special methods and tools. Each\nmethod has its own set of input parameters, with which you can choose a method for a specific case and for specific data. In the Surfer software package, 12 interpolation methods are presented. To create an interpolated model that is close to the idea, it is necessary to choose the right model as well as its parameters. The answer to the\nquestion whether the created model is adequate to the real model can only be obtained after analyzing and calculating the so-called residuals. The article contains a table and a map of discrepancies, where clearly visible the quality characteristics of the created model.","authors":["N.
