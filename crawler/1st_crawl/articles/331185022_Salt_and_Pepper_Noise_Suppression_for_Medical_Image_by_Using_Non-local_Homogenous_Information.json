{"id":"331185022_Salt_and_Pepper_Noise_Suppression_for_Medical_Image_by_Using_Non-local_Homogenous_Information","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method to suppress salt and pepper noise for medical images based on the homogenous information obtained by non-symmetrical and anti-packing model (NAM). The NAM could divide the image into several homogenous blocks and it is sensitive to the additive extra energy. Thus the noise could be detected effectively due to the usage of bit-plane during the division. Then corrupted points are estimated by using a distance based weighted mean filter according to the homogenous information in its non-local region, which could keep local structure. Experimental results show that our method can obtain denoising results with high quality.","authors":["Hu Liang","Zhao Shengrong"],"meta":["January 2020Studies in Computational Intelligence","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-04946-1_19","In book: Cognitive Internet of Things: Frameworks, Tools and Applications (pp.189-199)"],"references":["319164070_Salt-n-pepper_noise_filtering_using_Cellular_Automata","262384558_Rough_set_based_image_denoising_for_brain_MR_images","3328020_Salt-and-Pepper_Noise_Removal_by_Median-Type_Noise_Detectors_and_Detail-Preserving_Regularization","318999540_Motor_Anomaly_Detection_for_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles_Using_Reinforcement_Learning","313352817_The_NAMlet_transform_A_novel_image_sparse_representation_method_based_on_non-symmetry_and_anti-packing_model","289631200_The_research_based_on_the_genetic_algorithm_of_wavelet_image_denoising_threshold_of_medicine","259095093_Underwater_image_dehazing_using_joint_trilateral_filter","223931455_Local_self-adaptive_fuzzy_filter_for_impulsive_noise_removal_in_color_images","222417711_Tetrolet_transform_A_new_adaptive_Haar_wavelet_algorithm_for_sparse_image_representation","5562179_Adaptive_median_filter_new_algorithms_and_results","3343613_A_New_Directional_Weighted_Median_Filter_for_Removal_of_Random-Valued_Impulse_Noise","3343070_Advanced_Impulse_Detection_Based_on_Pixel-Wise_MAD","3325237_Progressive_switching_median_filter_for_the_removal_of_impulse_noise_from_highly_corrupted_images","3314063_Analysis_of_the_properties_of_median_and_weighted_median_filters_using_threshold_logic_and_stack_filter_representation"]}
