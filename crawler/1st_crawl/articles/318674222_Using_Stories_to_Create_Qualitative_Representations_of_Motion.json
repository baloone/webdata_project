{"id":"318674222_Using_Stories_to_Create_Qualitative_Representations_of_Motion","abstract":"Qualitative representations of motion transform kinematic floating point data into a finite set of concepts. Their main advantage is that they usually reflect a human understanding of the moving system, so we can more straightforwardly implement human-like navigation rules; in addition, they reduce the overhead of floating point computations. Therefore, they are an asset for mobile robots or unmanned vehicles— both terrestrial and aerial—especially those that interact with humans. In this paper we provide a method to create new qualitative representations of motion from any qualitative spatial representation by using a story-based approach.","authors":["Juan Purcalla Arrufi","Alexandra Kirsch"],"meta":["July 2017","Conference: ProSocrates 2017, 2nd Symposium on Problem-solving, Creativity and Spatial Reasoning in Cognitive SystemsAt: Hanse-Wissenschafstkolleg (HWK), Institute for Advanced Study, Delmenhorst, Germany"],"references":["261399755_Analysis_of_human-robot_spatial_behaviour_applying_a_qualitative_trajectory_calculus","235245933_SailAway_Formalizing_Navigation_Rules","221562009_Interpreting_Motion_Expressions_in_Route_Instructions_Using_Two_Projection-Based_Spatial_Models","303750072_A_Survey_of_Qualitative_Spatial_and_Temporal_Calculi_--_Algebraic_and_Computational_Properties","283925025_Maintaining_Knowledge_about_Temporal_Intervals","271898381_A_survey_of_qualitative_spatial_representations","257404943_QRPC_A_new_qualitative_model_for_representing_motion_patterns","235361607_The_Hidden_Dimension","233857966_Representing_and_reasoning_about_continuously_moving_objects_a_qualitative_approach","221471597_Reasoning_about_Binary_Topological_Relations"]}
