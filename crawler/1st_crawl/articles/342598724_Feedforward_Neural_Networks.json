{"id":"342598724_Feedforward_Neural_Networks","abstract":"This chapter provides a more in-depth description of supervised learning, deep learning, and neural networksâ€”presenting the foundational mathematical and statistical learning concepts and explaining how they relate to real-world examples in trading, risk management, and investment management. These applications present challenges for forecasting and model design and are presented as a reoccurring theme throughout the book. This chapter moves towards a more engineering style exposition of neural networks, applying concepts in the previous chapters to elucidate various model design choices.","authors":["Matthew Dixon","Igor Halperin","Paul Bilokon"],"meta":["July 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-41068-1_4","In book: Machine Learning in Finance (pp.111-166)"],"references":["343402476_Deep_Local_Volatility","328107188_Implicit_Self-Regularization_in_Deep_Neural_Networks_Evidence_from_Random_Matrix_Theory_and_Implications_for_Learning","309131837_Why_Deep_Neural_Networks","308964873_The_Generalized_Reparameterization_Gradient","301841654_Learning_Real_and_Boolean_Functions_When_Is_Deep_Better_Than_Shallow","273388040_Deep_Learning_and_the_Information_Bottleneck_Principle","266225209_Large_Scale_Distributed_Deep_Networks","260869405_Optimal_perceptual_inference","221618913_Convex_Neural_Networks","200744506_Exponential_family_harmoniums_with_an_application_to_information_retrieval","331025367_Deep_Learning_Volatility","324054908_Posterior_Concentration_for_Sparse_Deep_Learning","321581423_Classification-based_financial_markets_prediction_using_deep_neural_networks","319770134_Stochastic_Backpropagation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Deep_Generative_Models","319770007_Benefits_of_depth_in_neural_networks","316708588_Machine_Learning_An_Applied_Econometric_Approach","315942694_Measuring_the_unmeasurable_an_application_of_uncertainty_quantification_to_Treasury_bond_portfolios","314361329_Nearly-tight_VC-dimension_bounds_for_piecewise_linear_neural_networks","305119629_Deep_Learning_for_Mortgage_Risk","301844682_Deep_Learning_in_Finance","299487629_Classification-Based_Financial_Markets_Prediction_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks","287249598_A_Theoretically_Grounded_Application_of_Dropout_in_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","282072203_A_Statistical_Theory_of_Deep_Learning_via_Proximal_Splitting","277959098_Dropout_as_a_Bayesian_Approximation_Representing_Model_Uncertainty_in_Deep_Learning","272521934_Probabilistic_Backpropagation_for_Scalable_Learning_of_Bayesian_Neural_Networks","267706055_Practical_Variational_Inference_for_Neural_Networks","266248467_BAYESIAN_LEARNING_FOR_NEURAL_NETWORKS_Bayesian_Learning_for_Neural_Networks","260022128_Neural_Variational_Inference_and_Learning_in_Belief_Networks","259400035_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","252657040_Learning_and_Evaluating_Boltzmann_Machines","246899051_Multilayer_feedforward_networks_are_universal_approximator","245582009_A_practical_Bayesian_framework_for_backpropagation_networks","243787569_Introductory_Lectures_on_Convex_Optimization_A_Basic_Course","243771025_Ensemble_learning_in_Bayesian_neural_networks","239546749_Statistical_Learning_Theory","227360435_A_Unified_Theory_of_Estimation_and_Inference_for_Nonlinear_Dynamic_Models_AR_Gallant_and_H_White","224513847_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_Information_Science_and_Statistics","222797300_Multilayer_Feedforward_Networks_are_Universal_Approxmations_Neural_Networks_2_No_5_359-366","221346268_Training_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_using_Approximations_to_the_Likelihood_Gradient","220320714_Probabilistic_Non-linear_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Gaussian_Process_Latent_Variable_Models","216300763_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction","200744527_Learning_Stochastic_Feedforward_Networks","200744453_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines","45893028_Learning_the_Structure_of_Deep_Sparse_Graphical_Models","13338024_Variational_Learning_in_Nonlinear_Gaussian_Belief_Networks","4768426_A_Nonparametric_Approach_to_Pricing_and_Hedging_Derivative_Securities_Via_Learning_Networks","4724934_Testing_for_Neglected_Nonlinearity_in_Long-Memory_Models","4721455_On_the_Nonlinear_Predictability_of_Stock_Returns_Using_Financial_and_Economic_Variables","3545279_There_exists_a_neural_network_that_does_not_make_avoidable_mistakes","2813278_Computing_With_Infinite_Networks","2718006_Bayesian_Training_of_Backpropagation_Networks_by_the_Hybrid_Monte_Carlo_Method","2357203_A_Model_Selection_Approach_to_Assessing_the_Information_in_the_Term_Structure_Using_Linear_Models_and_Artificial_Neural_Networks","2280218_Keeping_Neural_Networks_Simple_by_Minimizing_the_Description_Length_of_the_Weights","1961033_Mean_Field_Theory_for_Sigmoid_Belief_Networks"]}
