{"id":"311858889_An_Indonesian_Adaptation_of_the_System_Usability_Scale_SUS","abstract":"As a key aspect of product development, usability of a product is needed to be assessed by conducting usability evaluation. Within the usability evaluation methods, there are several usability assessment questionnaires; one of the most commonly used is the System Usability Scale (SUS). However, the SUS is originally developed in English and there had not been any study conducted to develop the Indonesian version of SUS. The adapted version is expected to help usability researchers and practitioners in Indonesia while conducting usability product evaluation. Therefore, this study was carried out to adapt the original SUS into the Indonesian version by using cross-cultural adaptation and reliability test. The Cronbachâ€™s Alpha of the Indonesian adaptation of SUS was 0.841, which concludes that this version is reliable to be used by usability practitioners.","authors":["Zahra Sharfina","Harry B.
