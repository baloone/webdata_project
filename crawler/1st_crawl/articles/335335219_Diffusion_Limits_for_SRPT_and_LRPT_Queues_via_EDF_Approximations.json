{"id":"335335219_Diffusion_Limits_for_SRPT_and_LRPT_Queues_via_EDF_Approximations","abstract":"We derive a heavy traffic analysis for a G/G/1 queue in which the server uses the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) policy from diffusion limits for G/G/1 Earliest Deadline First (EDF) systems. Our approach yields simple, concise justifications and new insights for SRPT heavy traffic limit theorems of Gromoll, Kruk and Puha [9]. Corresponding results for the longest remaining processing time (LRPT) policy are also provided.","authors":["Łukasz Kruk"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-27181-7_16","In book: Queueing Theory and Network Applications, 14th International Conference, QTNA 2019, Ghent, Belgium, August 27–29, 2019, Proceedings (pp.263-275)"],"references":["263967835_Diffusion_Limits_for_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Queues_under_Nonstandard_Spatial_Scaling","220462421_Queues_With_Equally_Heavy_Sojourn_Time_and_Service_Requirement_Distributions","220442627_Fluid_Limits_for_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Queues","2858734_Classifying_Scheduling_Policies_with_Respect_to_Unfairness_in_an_MGI1","2119922_A_large-deviations_analysis_of_the_GIGI1_SRPT_queue","318916738_Diffusion_Limits_for_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Queues","301579670_Fluid_Limits_for_Multiple-Input_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Queues","292799109_Heavy_traffic_in_a_system_with_a_discipline_of_priority_servicing_for_the_job_of_shortest_remaining_length_with_interruption","274497441_Analysis_of_SRPT_scheduling","266750869_A_system_with_Schrage_servicing_discipline_in_the_case_of_a_high_load","266553825_Diffusion_approximation_for_a_GG1_EDF_queue_with_unbounded_lead_times","265349175_Multiple_Channel_Queues_in_Heavy_Traffic_II","243556012_The_Steady-State_Appearance_of_the_MG1_Queue_under_the_Discipline_of_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time","242449491_The_Queue_MGI_with_the_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Discipline","239283427_A_Proof_of_the_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Discipline","220084779_Multi-layered_round_robin_routing_for_parallel_servers","45929287_Invariance_of_fluid_limits_for_the_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_and_Shortest_Job_First_policies","24136354_Priority_Auctions_and_Queue_Disciplines_That_Depend_on_Processing_Time","2817222_Real-Time_Queues_in_Heavy_Traffic_with_Earliest-Deadline-First_Queue_Discipline","2286633_Flow_and_Stretch_Metrics_for_Scheduling_Continuous_Job_Streams","2112687_Diffusion_approximation_for_a_processor_sharing_queue_in_heavy_traffic"]}
