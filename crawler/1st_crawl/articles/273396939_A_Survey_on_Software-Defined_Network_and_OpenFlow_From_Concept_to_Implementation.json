{"id":"273396939_A_Survey_on_Software-Defined_Network_and_OpenFlow_From_Concept_to_Implementation","abstract":"Software-defined network (SDN) has become one of the most important architectures for the management of largescale complex networks, which may require repolicing or reconfigurations from time to time. SDN achieves easy repolicing by decoupling the control plane from data plane. Thus, the network routers/switches just simply forward packets by following the flow table rules set by the control plane. Currently, OpenFlow is the most popular SDN protocol/standard and has a set of design specifications. Although SDN/OpenFlow is a relatively new area, it has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. In this paper, we will conduct a comprehensive survey of the important topics in SDN/OpenFlow implementation, including the basic concept, applications, language abstraction, controller, virtualization, quality of service, security, and its integration with wireless and optical networks. We will compare the pros and cons of different schemes and discuss the future research trends in this exciting area. This survey can help both industry and academia R&D people to understand the latest progress of SDN/OpenFlow designs.","authors":["Fei Hu","Qi Hao","Ke Bao"],"meta":["April 2014IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials 16(4):2181-2206","DOI:10.1109/COMST.2014.2326417"],"references":["303164480_A_NICE_way_to_test_OpenFlow_applications","272788552_Forwarding_and_Control_Element_Separation_ForCES_Framework","269035215_Exploitation_of_OpenFlow_in_wireless_sensor_networks","262329667_Enhancing_rural_connectivity_with_software_defined_networks","262276380_The_Case_for_Software-Defined_Networking_in_Heterogeneous_Networked_Environments","261447915_PolicyCop_An_Autonomic_QoS_Policy_Enforcement_Framework_for_Software_Defined_Networks","261226987_Deployment_of_Flow-Sensors_in_Internet_of_Things'_Virtualization_via_OpenFlow","261131634_Enhancing_responsiveness_and_scalability_for_OpenFlow_networks_via_control-message_quenching","261116087_Network_virtualization_and_resource_allocation_in_OpenFlow-based_wide_area_networks","261115864_Scalable_fault_management_for_OpenFlow","261075906_Toward_Software-Defined_Cellular_Networks","261060581_OpenQoS_An_OpenFlow_controller_design_for_multimedia_delivery_with_end-to-end_Quality_of_Service_over_Software-Defined_Networks","260670412_Software_defined_networks_Guest_Editorial","260651699_ProtoGENI_a_Prototype_GENI_Under_Security_Vulnerabilities_An_Experiment-Based_Security_Study","260514929_Improving_Network_Management_with_Software_Defined_Networking","260305361_Scalable_Network_Virtualization_in_Software-Defined_Networks","316857366_M2cloud_software_defined_multi-site_data_center_network_control_framework_for_multi-tenant","313422398_Autoslice_Automated_and_scalable_slicing_for_software-defined_networks","313038610_A_scalable_commodity_data_center_network_architecture","310793964_Enabling_future_internet_architecture_research_and_experimentation_by_using_software_defined_networking","301177043_OpenFlowSDN_for_MetroBackbone_Optical_Networks","301176872_OpenFlowSDN_and_Optical_Networks","288636852_Splendid_isolation_Language-based_security_for_softwaredefined_networks","278664988_DevoFlow","274455278_Broadband_internet_performance","271496673_BalanceFlow_Controller_load_balancing_for_OpenFlow_networks","267334704_Interdomain_Concepts_and_Quality_of_Service","266653104_ECOS_leveraging_software-defined_networks_to_support_mobile_application_offloading","263050494_Simultaneously_Reducing_Latency_and_Power_Consumption_in_OpenFlow_Switches","262423689_On_Controller_Performance_in_Software-defined_Networks","262209340_HyperFlow_A_Distributed_Control_Plane_for_OpenFlow","261501491_Considerations_for_Software_Defined_Networking_SDN_Approaches_and_use_cases","261501446_Towards_QoE-driven_multimedia_service_negotiation_and_path_optimization_with_software_defined_networking","261491036_Macroflows_and_Microflows_Enabling_Rapid_Network_Innovation_through_a_Split_SDN_Data_Plane","261461727_On_QoS_Support_to_Ofelia_and_OpenFlow","261396758_Enabling_Hardware_Exploration_in_Software-Defined_Networking_A_Flexible_Portable_OpenFlow_Switch","261394129_Role_of_network_virtualization_in_future_Internet_innovation","261351998_A_Design_and_Implementation_of_OpenFlow_Controller_Handling_IP_Multicast_with_Fast_Tree_Switching","261320787_Reliability-aware_controller_placement_for_Software-Defined_Networks","261313115_Why_OpenFlowSDN_can_succeed_where_GMPLS_failed","261110451_End-to-End_Header_Compression_over_Software-Defined_Networks_A_Low_Latency_Network_Architecture","261084304_Palette_Distributing_Tables_in_Software-Defined_Networks","261076014_Techno-economic_Analysis_of_Software_Defined_Networking_as_Architecture_for_the_Virtualization_of_a_Mobile_Network","261075908_OpenFlow_Virtualization_Framework_with_Advanced_Capabilities","261060209_Traffic_engineering_in_software_defined_networks","261057543_Improving_Cloud_Datacentre_Scalability_Agility_and_Performance_Using_OpenFlow","260708200_On_scalability_of_software-defined_networking","260670444_MobileFlow_Toward_Software-Defined_Mobile_Networks","260584066_Software-Defined_Networking_On_the_Verge_of_a_Breakthrough","260514931_Languages_for_software-defined_networks","259179104_Sensor_OpenFlow_Enabling_Software-Defined_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","259132133_A_Loss-Free_Multipathing_Solution_for_Data_Center_Network_Using_Software-Defined_Networking_Approach","260060930_Implementing_Layer_2_Network_Virtualization_Using_OpenFlow_Challenges_and_Solutions","259207352_LibNetVirt_The_network_virtualization_library","258440035_Software_Defined_Wireless_Networks_Unbridling_SDNs"]}
