{"id":"337214802_A_Novel_Statistical_Analysis_and_Autoencoder_Driven_Intelligent_Intrusion_Detection_Approach","abstract":"In the current digital era, one of the most critical and challenging issue is ensuring cybersecurity in information technology (IT) infrastructures. Indeed, with the significant improvement of technology, hackers have been developing ever more complex and dangerous malware attacks that make the intrusion recognition a very difficult task. In this context, the existing traditional analytic tools are facing severe challenges to detect and mitigate these threats. In this work, we introduce a statistical analysis and autoencoder (AE) driven intelligent intrusion detection (IDS) system. Specifically, the proposed IDS combines data analytics, statistical techniques with recent advances in machine learning theory to extract optimized and more correlated features. The validity of the proposed IDS is tested using the benchmark NSL-KDD database. Experimental results show that the designed IDS achieves better classification performance as compared to deep and conventional shallow machine learning as well as recently proposed state-of-the-art techniques.","authors":["Cosimo Ieracitano","Ahsan Adeel","Francesco Carlo Morabito","Amir Hussain"],"meta":["November 2019Neurocomputing 387","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2019.11.016"],"references":["333379379_Facial_Expression_Recognition_Based_on_a_Hybrid_Model_Combining_Deep_and_Shallow_Features","329450947_A_comparison_study_for_intrusion_database_KDD99_NSL-KDD_based_on_self_organization_map_SOM_artificial_neural_network","325887753_Deep_Learning_Method_for_Denial_of_Service_Attack_Detection_Based_on_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine","323750220_Sentic_LSTM_a_Hybrid_Network_for_Targeted_Aspect-Based_Sentiment_Analysis","322668042_Information_Theoretic-Based_Interpretation_of_a_Deep_Neural_Network_Approach_in_Diagnosing_Psychogenic_Non-Epileptic_Seizures","321069732_Applications_of_Deep_Learning_and_Reinforcement_Learning_to_Biological_Data","320435651_A_fast_online_sequential_learning_accelerator_for_IoT_network_intrusion_detection_work-in-progress","320213729_Reducing_and_Stretching_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Features_for_Accurate_Image_Classification","315469263_Method_of_intrusion_detection_using_deep_neural_network","309698316_Performance_analysis_of_NSL-KDD_dataset_using_ANN","301734420_Deep_Belief_Networks_for_Quantitative_Analysis_of_a_Gold_Immunochromatographic_Strip","288991542_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Network_Intrusion_Detection_System","277411157_Deep_Learning","228664767_Vision_and_Challenges_for_Realizing_the_Internet_of_Things","48446353_A_detailed_analysis_of_the_KDD_CUP_99_data_set","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","328739764_Robust_Pixelwise_Saliency_Detection_via_Progressive_Graph_Rankings","328121892_A_Convolutional_Neural_Network_approach_for_Classification_of_Dementia_Stages_based_on_2D-Spectral_Representation_of_EEG_recordings","327612194_A_Novel_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Approach_for_Network_Intrusion_Detection_on_Cloud-Based_Robotic_System","327470284_A_New_Switching-Delayed-PSO-Based_Optimized_SVM_Algorithm_for_Diagnosis_of_Alzheimer's_Disease","327299183_An_Intrusion_Detection_System_Using_a_Deep_Neural_Network_With_Gated_Recurrent_Units","326565838_Effective_Feature_Extraction_via_Stacked_Sparse_Autoencoder_to_Improve_Intrusion_Detection_System","325433721_A_New_Two-layer_Mixture_of_Factor_Analyzers_with_Joint_Factor_Loading_Model_for_the_Classification_of_Small_Dataset_Problems","322866638_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_to_Network_Intrusion_Detection","320366926_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Intrusion_Detection_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","319567060_Facial_Expression_Recognition_via_Learning_Deep_Sparse_Autoencoders","313450024_Toward_an_Online_Anomaly_Intrusion_Detection_System_Based_on_Deep_Learning","313263240_Got_Phished_Internet_Security_and_Human_Vulnerability","309729096_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Network_Intrusion_Detection_in_Software_Defined_Networking","286192171_Random_Neural_Network_based_novel_decision_making_framework_for_optimized_and_autonomous_power_control_in_LTE_uplink_system","279421890_Support_Vector_Machines","261474720_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis","221995504_The_Use_of_the_Area_Under_the_ROC_Curve_in_the_Evaluation_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","5598858_Vapnik_VN_An_overview_of_statistical_learning_theory_IEEE_Trans_Neural_Netw_10_988-999","3083296_Axiomatic_Derivation_of_the_Principle_of_Maximum_Entropy_and_the_Principle_of_Minimum_Cross-Entropy"]}
