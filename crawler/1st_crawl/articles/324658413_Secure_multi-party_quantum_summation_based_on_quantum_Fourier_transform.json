{"id":"324658413_Secure_multi-party_quantum_summation_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel secure multi-party quantum summation protocol based on quantum Fourier transform, where the traveling particles are transmitted in a tree-type mode. The party who prepares the initial quantum states is assumed to be semi-honest, which means that she may misbehave on her own but will not conspire with anyone. The proposed protocol can resist both the outside attacks and the participant attacks. Especially, one party cannot obtain other partiesâ€™ private integer strings; and it is secure for the colluding attack performed by at most \\( n - 2 \\) parties, where \\( n \\) is the number of parties. In addition, the proposed protocol calculates the addition of modulo \\( d \\) and implements the calculation of addition in a secret-by-secret way rather than a bit-by-bit way.","authors":["Hui-Yi Yang","Tian-Yu Ye"],"meta":["April 2018Quantum Information Processing 17(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-018-1890-1"],"references":["318755023_Quantum_solution_to_a_class_of_two-party_private_summation_problems","318194822_Cryptanalysis_of_a_multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_protocol_based_on_commutative_encryption","315960511_Quantum_key_agreement_protocols_with_single_photon_in_both_polarization_and_spatial-mode_degrees_of_freedom","315596605_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Based_on_Quantum_Search_Algorithm","311698128_Multi-party_Quantum_Key_Agreement_without_Entanglement","309922427_Two_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocols_Immune_to_Collective_Noise","317887654_A_Generic_Construction_of_Quantum-Oblivious-Key-Transfer-Based_Private_Query_with_Ideal_Database_Security_and_Zero_Failure","314829083_Secure_multi-party_quantum_computation","313321156_Multi-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party_based_on_single_particles","312685110_Quantum_cryptography_based_on_Bell's_theorem","308005605_Two-party_quantum_key_agreement_against_collective_noise","301880421_Multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_protocol_secure_against_collusion_attacks","294733570_Collusive_Attacks_to_Circle-Type_Multi-party_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocols","309436067_Improved_multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_in_travelling_mode","301279477_Practical_quantum_private_query_with_better_performance_in_resisting_joint-measurement_attack"]}
