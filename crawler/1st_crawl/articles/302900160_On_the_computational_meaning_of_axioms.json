{"id":"302900160_On_the_computational_meaning_of_axioms","abstract":"This paper investigates an anti-realist theory of meaning suitable for both logical and proper axioms. Unlike other anti-realist accounts such as Dummett–Prawitz verificationism, the standard framework of classical logic is not called into question. This account also admits semantic features beyond the inferential ones: computational aspects play an essential role in the determination of meaning. To deal with these computational aspects, a relaxation of syntax is necessary. This leads to a general kind of proof theory, where the objects of study are not typed objects like deductions, but rather untyped ones, in which formulas are replaced by geometrical configurations.","authors":["Alberto Naibo","Mattia Petrolo","Thomas Seiller"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-26506-3_5","In book: Epistemology, Knowledge and the Impact of Interaction (pp.141-184)Chapter: 5Publisher: Springer International PublishingEditors: Juan Redmond, Olga Pombo Martins, Ángel Nepomuceno Fernández"],"references":["283545786_The_Baltic_International_Yearbook_of_Cognition_Logic_and_Communication_CONSTRUCTIVE_TYPE_THEORY_AND_THE_DIALOGICAL_APPROACH_TO_MEANING","239549896_Radical_Anti-Realism_and_Substructural_Logics","228577539_Inferentialism_logicism_harmony_and_a_counterpoint","227143052_On_How_to_Be_a_Dialogician","226691831_Constructions_proofs_and_the_meaning_of_logical_constants","225871689_Feasibility_In_Logic","344552720_Basic_Proof_Theory","321497732_Logische_Propadeutik","319394112_On_the_meanings_of_the_logical_constant_and_the_justifications_of_the_logical_laws","315197572_Proclus_A_Commentary_on_the_First_Book_of_Euclid's_Elements","303472129_Hilbert_and_Logic","290990830_Geometry_and_empirical_science","282372678_The_Game_of_Language","281796838_Regles_et_signification_le_point_de_vue_de_la_logique_classique","280847299_A_computational_analysis_of_logical_constants_From_inferentialism_to_an_untyped_perspective_with_Thomas_Seiller","277470107_Popular_Lectures_on_Mathematical_Logic","271845125_Konstruktive_Wissenschaftstheorie","268709473_Axiomatic_method_and_intuitionism","268547096_On_how_to_be_a_dialogician_A_short_overview_on_recent_developments_on_dialogues_and_games","267130589_Gentzen_Calculi_for_Modal_Propositional_Logic","267065141_The_blind_spot_Lectures_on_logic","265817915_Proof_analysis_A_contribution_to_Hilbert's_last_problem","265548251_Lectures_on_the_Curry-Howard_Isomorphism","265536201_Substructural_Logics_A_Primer","265332090_Elements_of_Intuitionism","262641249_Interaction_Graphs_Graphings","261957888_Are_Uniqueness_and_Deducibility_of_Identicals_the_Same","259654699_Logique_dans_le_Facteur_Hyperfini_Geometrie_de_l'Interaction_et_Complexite","259106322_Interaction_Graphs_Exponentials","257666400_Figures_of_dialogue_A_view_from_Ludics","257144596_Dependent_choice_'quote'_and_the_clock","251120028_Begriffsbildung_und_Beweis_in_der_Mathematik","249494696_Proofs_as_Acts_and_Proofs_as_Objects_Some_questions_for_Dag_Prawitz","248878119_Proof_theory_some_personal_recollections","247944349_The_Philosophical_Basis_of_Intuitionistic_Logic","246928086_Neue_Fassung_des_Widerspruchsfreiheitsbeweises_fur_die_reine_Zahlentheorie","246241712_Frege_Philosophy_of_Language","243647283_What_is_a_Theory_of_Meaning_I","240332343_The_Seas_of_Language","240153301_On_the_Meanings_of_the_Logical_Constants_and_the_Justifications_of_the_Logical_Laws","240001242_Foundations_of_Intuitionistic_Logic","238359827_Towards_A_Foundation_of_A_General_Proof_Theory","233191975_Completeness_and_Categoricity_Part_I_Nineteenth-century_Axiomatics_to_Twentieth-century_Metalogic","228550345_From_proof_theory_to_theories_theory","227306983_Ludics_and_Rhetorics","226690416_Truth_of_a_proposition_evidence_of_a_judgement_validity_of_a_proof","226402198_Game_Semantics_and_the_Manifestation_Thesis","226399806_Ein_System_des_Verknupfenden_Schliessens","225173927_Radical_anti-realism_Wittgenstein_and_the_length_of_proofs","225075038_Interaction_Graphs_Multiplicatives","225075037_Interaction_Graphs_Additives","222541451_Proof_theory_in_the_abstract","221942985_Linear_Logic","220690164_Structural_Proof_Theory","220689587_Elements_of_the_History_of_Mathematics"]}
