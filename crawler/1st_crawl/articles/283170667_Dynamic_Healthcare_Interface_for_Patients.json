{"id":"283170667_Dynamic_Healthcare_Interface_for_Patients","abstract":"Canadian healthcare is a fundamental part of society. Challenges such as the aging baby boomer generation require the healthcare industry to meet higher demands while using fewer resources. Computer systems designed to record and report physical health properties of an individual personcan be used in part to accomplish this task. In this paper, we present the architecture of a hypothetical multi-agent system designed to provide healthcare information about specific patients through continuous monitoring. The resulting data from the system is accessible by the patient to whom it belongs as well as his or her healthcare professional. Furthermore, the proposed system utilizes an adaptive user interface for the purpose of improving the overall experience for users with poor vision or motor skills. Specifically, we focus on the implementation of several of the key components involved in the adaptive user interface: learning component and the user model. To demonstrate the feasibility of the implementation two scenarios are provided. We conclude with several possible future directions for this research.","authors":["Elhadi Shakshuki","Malcolm Reid","Tarek R.
