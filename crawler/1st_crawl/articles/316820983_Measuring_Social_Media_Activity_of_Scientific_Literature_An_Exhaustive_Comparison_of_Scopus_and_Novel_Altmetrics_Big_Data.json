{"id":"316820983_Measuring_Social_Media_Activity_of_Scientific_Literature_An_Exhaustive_Comparison_of_Scopus_and_Novel_Altmetrics_Big_Data","abstract":"This paper measures social media activity of 15 broad scientific disciplines indexed in Scopus database using Altmetric.com data. First, the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database is investigated, overall and across disciplines. Second, the correlation between the bibliometric and altmetric indices is examined using Spearman correlation. Third, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is used to determine the association of various factors with increasing or decreasing citations. Lastly, the effectiveness of altmetric indices to identify publications with high citation impact is comprehensively evaluated by deploying Area Under the Curve (AUC) - an application of receiver operating characteristic. Results indicate a rapid increase in the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database from 10.19% in 2011 to 20.46% in 2015. A zero-truncated negative binomial model is implemented to measure the extent to which different bibliometric and altmetric factors contribute to citation counts. Blog count appears to be the most important factor increasing the number of citations by 38.6% in the field of Health Professions and Nursing, followed by Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8% in the field of Physics and Astronomy. Interestingly, both Blog count and Twitter count always show positive increase in the number of citations across all fields. While there was a positive weak correlation between bibliometric and altmetric indices, the results show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to discriminate highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC= 0.725 between highly cited publications and total altmetric count. Overall, findings suggest that altmetrics could better distinguish highly cited publications.","authors":["Saeed-Ul Hassan","Mubashir Imran","Uzair Gillani","Naif Radi Aljohani"],"meta":["May 2017Scientometrics","DOI:10.1007/s11192-017-2512-x"],"references":["311337980_Bibliographic_Analysis_of_Nature_Based_on_Twitter_and_Facebook_Altmetrics_Data","309962068_Twitter_Predicts_Citation_Rates_of_Ecological_Research","307303664_Scholarly_use_of_social_media_and_altmetrics_A_review_of_the_literature","289292128_How_well_developed_are_altmetrics_cross-disciplinary_analysis_of_the_presence_of_'alternative_metrics'_in_scientific_publications_RIP","280802210_I_Like_I_Cite_Do_Facebook_Likes_Predict_the_Impact_of_Scientific_Work","268271559_Users_Narcissism_and_Control-Tracking_the_Impact_of_Scholarly_Publications_in_the_21_st_Century","266620796_Disciplinary_differences_in_Twitter_scholarly_communication","261365934_How_well_developed_are_Altmetrics_Cross-disciplinary_analysis_of_the_presence_of_'alternative_metrics'_in_scientific_publications","255206038_Predicting_the_importance_of_current_papers","236978654_Do_Altmetrics_Work_Twitter_and_Ten_Other_Social_Web_Services","236455602_Coverage_and_adoption_of_altmetrics_sources_in_the_bibliometric_community","225045676_Beyond_citations_Scholars'_visibility_on_the_social_Web","51883205_Correction_Can_Tweets_Predict_Citations_Metrics_of_Social_Impact_Based_on_Twitter_and_Correlation_with_Traditional_Metrics_of_Scientific_Impact","1890381_Scientific_citations_in_Wikipedia","320608894_On_the_differences_between_citations_and_altmetrics_An_investigation_of_factors_driving_altmetrics_vs_citations_for_Finnish_articles","314116441_Uncovering_fine-grained_research_excellence_The_global_research_benchmarking_system","313417403_What_we_can_learn_from_tweets_linking_to_research_papers","313035423_Context_of_altmetrics_data_matters_an_investigation_of_count_type_and_user_category","309240917_Enriching_scholarly_content_with_article-level_discussion_and_metrics","276234398_The_relationship_between_tweets_citations_and_article_views_for_PLOS_ONE_articles","272271907_Altmetric_Enriching_scholarly_content_with_article-leveldiscussion_and_metrics","261855483_Evaluating_altmetric","261365829_What_is_the_impact_of_the_publications_read_by_the_different_Mendeley_users_Could_they_help_to_identify_alternative_types_of_impact","260306816_Do_Blog_Citations_Correlate_With_a_Higher_Number_of_Future_Citations_Research_Blogs_as_a_Potential_Source_for_Alternative_Metrics","260282747_Altmetrics_A_Manifesto","259783194_Do_altmetrics_correlate_with_citations_Extensive_comparison_of_altmetric_indicators_with_citations_from_a_multidisciplinary_perspective","256804987_Which_Factors_Help_Authors_Produce_the_Highest_Impact_Research_Collaboration_Journal_and_Document_Properties","255704500_Tweeting_Biomedicine_An_Analysis_of_Tweets_and_Citations_in_the_Biomedical_Literature","227604791_Earlier_Web_Usage_Statistics_as_Predictors_of_Later_Citation_Impact","222570343_MPACT_and_citation_impact_Two_sides_of_the_same_scholarly_coin","221901291_Altmetrics_in_the_wild_Using_social_media_to_explore_scholarly_impact","220065946_Applying_Social_Bookmarking_Data_to_Evaluate_Journal_Usage","215993579_Scientometrics_20_New_metrics_of_scholarly_impact_on_the_social_Web"]}
