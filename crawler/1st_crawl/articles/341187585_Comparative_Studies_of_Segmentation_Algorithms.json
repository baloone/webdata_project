{"id":"341187585_Comparative_Studies_of_Segmentation_Algorithms","abstract":"Digital Image Processing is a transforming process from analog signal to digital signal. It is an essential part of Computer Science. In Image Processing filed, Image Segmentation addresses issues about how to extract some regions that people are interested in, which is a challenging task for many scientists and scholars. In general, image segmentation algorithms could be divided into two categories: region-based and edge-based. This paper investigates and compares four common Image Segmentation algorithms include Thresholding, Region Growing Labeling, Edge Detection and Mean Shift algorithms. Due to image segmentation problems are similar with classification problems in Machine Learning, plotting Receiver Operating characteristic curve and Precision Recall curve to in algorithm evaluation phase. Results of experiments demonstrate that each algorithm has its advantage and disadvantage. The significance of comparative studies for different segmentation algorithms tries to improve existing algorithms or find new algorithms to achieve better performance.","authors":["Yanda Zhu","Yuxuan Zhao","Ka Lok Man"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Integrated Circuits and Systems"],"references":["318665037_Performance_metrics_comparison_of_various_image_segmentation_methods","292773066_Mean_shift_towards_feature_space_analysis","242616107_The_fundamentals_of_digital_image_processing_prentice-hall","235157603_ROC_Analysis_of_IR_Segmentation_Techniques","220659724_Learning_Probabilistic_Models_for_Contour_Completion_in_Natural_Images","215721564_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_From_Grey_Level_Histograms","215721562_Efficient_Graph-Based_Image_Segmentation"]}
