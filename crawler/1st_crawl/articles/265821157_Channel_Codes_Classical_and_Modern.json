{"id":"265821157_Channel_Codes_Classical_and_Modern","abstract":"Channel coding lies at the heart of digital communication and data storage, and this detailed introduction describes the core theory as well as decoding algorithms, implementation details, and performance analyses. Known for their writing clarity, Professors Ryan and Lin provide the latest information on modern channel codes, including turbo and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. They also present detailed coverage of BCH codes, Reed-Solomon codes, convolutional codes, finite geometry codes, and product codes, providing a one-stop resource for both classical and modern coding techniques. Assuming no prior knowledge in the field of channel coding, the opening chapters begin with basic theory to introduce newcomers to the subject. Later chapters then extend to advanced topics such as code ensemble performance analyses and algebraic code design. 250 varied and stimulating end-of-chapter problems are also included to test and enhance learning, making this an essential resource for students and practitioners alike.","authors":["William E Ryan","Shu Lin"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1017/CBO9780511803253"],"references":["225019400_Simple_Reconfigurable_Low-Density_Parity-Check_Codes","4353260_Constructions_of_high_performance_non-binary_quasi-cyclic_LDPC_codes","224679147_Burst-Correction_Decoding_of_Cyclic_LDPC_Codes","224678893_Algebraic_Constructions_of_Nonbinary_Quasi-Cyclic_LDPC_Codes","224675746_An_IS_simulation_technique_for_very_low_BER_performance_evaluation_of_LDPC_codes","224516702_Toward_low_LDPC-code_floors_A_case_study","224343635_Pinning_Techniques_for_Low-Floor_DetectionDecoding_of_LDPC-Coded_Partial_Response_Channels","220684166_The_limiting_behavior_of_the_Z-channel_Corresp","4275873_Erasure-Burst_and_Error-Burst_Decoding_of_Linear_Codes","3917507_Regular_low-density_parity-check_codes_from_oval_designs"]}
