{"id":"297583941_Reconstruction_of_Tissue-Specific_Metabolic_Networks_Using_CORDA","abstract":"Human metabolism involves thousands of reactions and metabolites. To interpret this complexity, computational modeling becomes an essential experimental tool. One of the most popular techniques to study human metabolism as a whole is genome scale modeling. A key challenge to applying genome scale modeling is identifying critical metabolic reactions across diverse human tissues. Here we introduce a novel algorithm called Cost Optimization Reaction Dependency Assessment (CORDA) to build genome scale models in a tissue-specific manner. CORDA performs more efficiently computationally, shows better agreement to experimental data, and displays better model functionality and capacity when compared to previous algorithms. CORDA also returns reaction associations that can greatly assist in any manual curation to be performed following the automated reconstruction process. Using CORDA, we developed a library of 76 healthy and 20 cancer tissue-specific reconstructions. These reconstructions identified which metabolic pathways are shared across diverse human tissues. Moreover, we identified changes in reactions and pathways that are differentially included and present different capacity profiles in cancer compared to healthy tissues, including up-regulation of folate metabolism, the down-regulation of thiamine metabolism, and tight regulation of oxidative phosphorylation.","authors":["Andr√© Schultz","Amina Qutub"],"meta":["March 2016PLoS Computational Biology 12(3):e1004808","DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004808"],"references":["302937300_Drug_off-target_effects_predicted_using_structural_analysis_in_the_context_of_a_metabolic_network_model","281514126_Tumors_and_Mitochondrial_Respiration_A_Neglected_Connection","280492322_Human_metabolic_atlas_An_online_resource_for_human_metabolism","277781227_Flux_balance_analysis_predicts_essential_genes_in_clear_cell_renal_cell_carcinoma_metabolism","275835689_Proteome-_and_Transcriptome-Driven_Reconstruction_of_the_Human_Myocyte_Metabolic_Network_and_Its_Use_for_Identification_of_Markers_for_Diabetes","277351458_Antimetabolite_Treatment_for_Pancreatic_Cancer","276265330_The_human_transcriptome_across_tissues_and_individuals","276204581_The_human_transcriptome_across_tissues_and_individuals","272755180_Reconstruction_of_genome-scale_human_metabolic_models_using_omics_data","272412219_Are_acinic_cell_carcinomas_of_the_breast_and_salivary_glands_distinct_diseases","271709927_Identifying_anti-growth_factors_for_human_cancer_cell_lines_through_genome-scale_metabolic_modeling","271335186_Proteomics_Tissue-based_map_of_the_human_proteome","266626818_Generalized_framework_for_context-specific_metabolic_model_extraction_methods","269183839_A_Role_for_the_Mitochondrial_Pyruvate_Carrier_as_a_Repressor_of_the_Warburg_Effect_and_Colon_Cancer_Cell_Growth","266246476_Salivary_Gland_Cancer_in_BRCA-Positive_Families_A_Retrospective_Review"]}
