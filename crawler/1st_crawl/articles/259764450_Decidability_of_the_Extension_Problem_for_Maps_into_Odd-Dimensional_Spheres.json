{"id":"259764450_Decidability_of_the_Extension_Problem_for_Maps_into_Odd-Dimensional_Spheres","abstract":"In a recent paper (Čadek et al., Discrete Comput Geom 51:24–66, 2014), it was shown that the problem of the existence of a continuous map \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) extending a given map \\(A \\rightarrow Y\\), defined on a subspace \\(A \\subseteq X\\), is undecidable, even for Y an even-dimensional sphere. In the present paper, we prove that the same problem for Y an odd-dimensional sphere is decidable. More generally, the same holds for any d-connected target space Y whose homotopy groups \\(\\pi _n Y\\) are finite for \\(2d<n<\\dim X\\). We also prove an equivariant version, where all spaces are equipped with free actions of a given finite groupG and all maps are supposed to respect these actions. This yields the computability of the \\(\\mathbb Z/2\\)-index of a given space up to an uncertainty of 1.","authors":["Lukáš Vokřínek"],"meta":["January 2017Discrete & Computational Geometry 57(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9835-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262830029_Extendability_of_Continuous_Maps_Is_Undecidable","259212184_Are_Two_Given_Maps_Homotopic_An_Algorithmic_Viewpoint","251566772_Algorithmic_Solvability_of_the_Lifting-Extension_Problem","233399208_Polynomial-Time_Computation_Of_Homotopy_Groups_And_Postnikov_Systems_In_Fixed_Dimension","51936092_Computing_All_Maps_into_a_Sphere","280173086_Polynomial-Time_Computation_of_Homotopy_Groups_and_Postnikov_Systems_in_Fixed_Dimension","268683244_Cohomology_operations_and_obstructions_to_extending_continuous_functions_Colloquium_lectures","260039735_Robust_Satisfiability_of_Systems_of_Equations","37687843_Simplicial_Objects_in_Algebraic_Topology"]}
