{"id":"3024070_Optimal_Control_of_Two_Level_Quantum_Systems","abstract":"We study the manipulation of two-level quantum systems. This\nresearch is motivated by the design of quantum mechanical logic gates\nwhich perform prescribed logic operations on a two-level quantum system,\na quantum bit. We consider the problem of driving the evolution operator\nto a desired state, while minimizing an energy-type cost.\nMathematically, this problem translates into an optimal control problem\nfor systems varying on the Lie group of special unitary matrices of\ndimension two, with cost that is quadratic in the control. We develop a\ncomprehensive theory of optimal control for two-level quantum systems.\nThis includes, in particular, a classification of normal and abnormal\nextremals and a proof of regularity of the optimal control functions.\nThe impact of the results of the paper on nuclear magnetic resonance\nexperiments and quantum computation is discussed","authors":["Domenico D'Alessandro","Mohammed Dahleh"],"meta":["July 2001IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 46(6):866 - 876","DOI:10.1109/9.928587","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["243475290_Complete_Control_of_Hamiltonian_Quantum_Systems_Engineering_of_Floquet_Evolution","215930210_The_Feyman_Lectures_on_Physics","321600821_Information_Complexity_and_Control_in_Quantum_Physics_Proceedings_of_the_4th_International_Seminar_on_Mathematical_Theory_of_Dynamical_Systems_and_Microphysics_Udine_September_4-13_1985","285441778_The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics","265465706_Elliptic_Functions_and_Applications","262178088_Optical_Resonance_and_Two-Level_Atoms","258890870_Ordinary_and_Delay_Differential_Equations","257012432_Topological_properties_of_reachable_sets_and_the_control_of_quantum_bits","253500972_Quantum_Control_and_Measurement","251748737_Quantum_computation_and_spin_physics","247677411_Supports_of_di_usion_processes_and_controllability_problems","244432774_Introduction_to_Lie_Groups_and_Lie_Algebras","243781824_Differential_Geometry_and_Symmetric_Spaces","243092707_The_High_Order_Maximal_Principle_and_Its_Application_to_Singular_Extremals","234968785_Geodesics_and_Classical_Mechanics_on_Lie_Groups","233971694_Holmes_PJ_Nonlinear_Oscillations_Dynamical_Systems_and_Bifurcations_of_Vector_Fields_Springer_New_York","226787217_Geometric_methods_for_nonlinear_optimal_control_problems","224537508_Geometrical_Representation_of_the_Schrdinger_Equation_for_Solving_Maser_Problems","224043755_Nonlinear_Oscillations_Dynamical_Systems_and_Bifurcations_of_Vector_Fields","50336570_Ordinary_Differential_Equation","50332008_Deterministic_and_Stochastics_Optimal_Control","44368912_Deterministic_and_stochastic_optimal_control_Wendell_Helms_Fleming","23816275_Control_systems_on_Lie_groups","23613808_System_Theory_on_Group_Manifolds_and_Coset_Spaces","4694984_Lie_Theory_and_Control_Systems_Defined_on_Spheres"]}
