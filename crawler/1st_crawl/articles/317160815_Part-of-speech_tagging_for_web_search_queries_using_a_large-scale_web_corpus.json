{"id":"317160815_Part-of-speech_tagging_for_web_search_queries_using_a_large-scale_web_corpus","abstract":"This paper proposes an accurate part-of-speech (POS) tagging method for Web search queries using the sentence level morphological analysis results of a large-scale Web corpus. POS tagging is a fundamental technique for analyzing queries; however, the existing NLP tools often fail to correctly identify POS tags because queries are not based on natural language grammar. We propose a method not affected by the queries' characteristics lacking capitalization and free word order with the term-POS database (TPDB). Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms those using existing NLP tools and the state-of-the-art method. In addition, the data set we created is expected to be useful for future researches on both POS tagging systems to queries and IR systems leveraging POS tags.","authors":["Atsushi Keyaki","Jun Miyazaki"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.1145/3019612.3019694","Conference: the Symposium"],"references":["303546932_Short_queries_natural_language_and_spoken_documents_retrieval_experiments_at_Glasgow_University","2882867_Feature-Rich_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_with_a_Cyclic_Dependency_Network","2604435_Short_Queries_Natural_Language_and_Spoken_Document_Retrieval_Experiments_at_Glasgow_University","285762269_Word_sense_disambiguation_improves_information_retrieval","282744876_Short_text_understanding_through_lexical-semantic_analysis","271452989_The_linguistic_structure_of_English_Web-search_queries","266658569_Improving_unsupervised_query_segmentation_using_parts-of-speech_sequence_information","262255716_Interpreting_keyword_queries_over_web_knowledge_bases","262220162_Using_search-logs_to_improve_query_tagging","234819712_The_SMART_Retrieval_System-Experiments_in_Automatic_Document_Processing","221614399_Structural_annotation_of_search_queries_using_pseudo-relevance_feedback","221299586_Extracting_Structured_Information_from_User_Queries_with_Semi-Supervised_Conditional_Random_Fields","220874746_Understanding_the_Semantic_Structure_of_Noun_Phrase_Queries","220873082_Joint_Annotation_of_Search_Queries","51887367_A_Universal_Part-of-Speech_Tagset","2936117_Query_Type_Classification_for_Web_Document_Retrieval","2567046_Using_Part-of-speech_Patterns_to_Reduce_Query_Ambiguity","2319300_Improving_Information_Retrieval_Systems_using_Part_of_Speech_Tagging"]}
