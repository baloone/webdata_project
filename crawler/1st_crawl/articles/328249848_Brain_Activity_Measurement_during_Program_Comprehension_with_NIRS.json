{"id":"328249848_Brain_Activity_Measurement_during_Program_Comprehension_with_NIRS","abstract":"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used as a low cost, noninvasive method to measure brain activity. In this paper, we measure the effects of variables and controls in a source code on brain activity during program comprehension. The measurement results are evaluated after noise reduction and normalization to statistical analysis. As the result of the experiment, significant differences in brain activity were observed at a task that requires memorizing variables to understand a code snippet. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed between different levels of mental arithmetic tasks. We conclude that the frontal pole reflects workload to short-term memory caused by variables without affected from calculation.","authors":["Yoshiharu Ikutani","Hidetake Uwano"],"meta":["November 2014International Journal of Networked and Distributed Computing 2(4):259-268","DOI:10.2991/ijndc.2014.2.4.7"],"references":["266656671_Quantifying_programmers'_mental_workload_during_program_comprehension_based_on_cerebral_blood_flow_measurement_A_controlled_experiment","220205490_Measurement_of_Brain_Function_of_Car_Driver_Using_Functional_Near-Infrared_Spectroscopy_fNIRS","8331826_On_the_suitability_of_near-infrared_NIR_systems_for_next-generation_brain-computer_interfaces","235920129_Toward_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_with_Functional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","224283606_A_brief_review_on_the_history_of_human_functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy_fNIRS_development_and_fields_of_application","14339810_Watanabe_E_Yamashita_Y_Maki_A_Ito_Y_Koizumi_HNon-invasive_functional_mapping_with_multi-channel_near_infra-red_spectroscopic_topography_in_humans_Neurosci_Lett_205_41-44","12035510_Interpretation_of_near-infrared_spectroscopy_signals_A_study_with_a_newly_developed_perfused_rat_brain_model","11083304_Quantitative_Comparison_of_Simultaneous_BOLD_fMRI_and_NIRS_Recordings_during_Functional_Brain_Activation"]}
