{"id":"235924920_Model-based_clustering_classification_and_discriminant_analysis_via_mixtures_of_multivariate_t-distributions_The_tEIGEN_family","abstract":"The last decade has seen an explosion of work on the use of mixture models for clustering. The use of the Gaussian mixture\nmodel has been common practice, with constraints sometimes imposed upon the component covariance matrices to give families\nof mixture models. Similar approaches have also been applied, albeit with less fecundity, to classification and discriminant\nanalysis. In this paper, we begin with an introduction to model-based clustering and a succinct account of the state-of-the-art.\nWe then put forth a novel family of mixture models wherein each component is modeled using a multivariate t-distribution with an eigen-decomposed covariance structure. This family, which is largely a t-analogue of the well-known MCLUST family, is known as the tEIGEN family. The efficacy of this family for clustering, classification, and discriminant analysis is illustrated with both\nreal and simulated data. The performance of this family is compared to its Gaussian counterpart on three real data sets.","authors":["Jeffrey Lambert Andrews","Paul McNicholas"],"meta":["September 2012Statistics and Computing 22(5):1021-1029","DOI:10.1007/s11222-011-9272-x"],"references":["284665947_Multivariate_data_analysis_as_a_discriminating_method_of_the_origin_of_wines","281696857_Gaussian_parsimonious_clustering_models","278628096_Variable_Selection_for_Clustering_with_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","236853556_Consistent_Estimate_of_the_Order_of_Mixture_Models","235174038_A_Computer_Program_for_the_Maximum-Likelihood_Analysis_of_Types","229100226_Mixture_Models_Inference_and_Applications_to_Clustering","225964520_Constrained_monotone_EM_algorithms_for_mixtures_of_multivariate_t_distributions","225069920_Detecting_Features_in_Spatial_Point_Processes_with_Clutter_via_Model-Based_Clustering","221649612_Weakly_Homoscedastic_Constraints_for_Mixtures_of_t-Distributions","220286644_Dimension_reduction_for_model-based_clustering","46036554_Model-Based_Clustering_of_Microarray_Expression_Data_via_Latent_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","317837054_Statistics_and_Computing","311508706_Consistent_estimation_of_the_order_of_mixture_models","301326177_Discriminant_Analysis_by_Gaussian_Mixtures","284507547_R_a_language_and_environment_for_statistical_computing_R_Foundation_for_Statistical_Computing","281247972_Robust_cluster_analysis_via_mixtures_of_multivariate_t-distributions","271205402_Bayes_Factor","269822231_Discriminant_Analysis_and_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition","268242663_Modern_Applied_Statistics_With_S-Plus","265620657_Bayesian_Computation_and_Stochastic_Systems","265505693_Model-Based_Gaussian_and_Non-Gaussian_Clustering","265369338_Mixture_Models_Theory_Geometry_and_Applications","261815374_Model-Based_Clustering_Discriminant_Analysis_and_Density_Estimation","256821857_A_Method_for_Cluster_Analysis","250754659_9_The_classification_and_mixture_maximum_likelihood_approaches_to_cluster_analysis","247641695_Statistical_Analysis_of_Finite_Mixture_Distributions_John_Wiley_and_Sons","245581819_Bayes_Factors_and_Model_Uncertainty","244958736_A_Missing_Information_Principle_Theory_and_Applications","244958264_A_maximization_technique_occurring_in_the_statistical_analysis_of_probabilistic_functions_of_Markov_chains","243787090_Maximum_likelihood_theory_for_incomplete_data_from_an_exponential_family","242997049_Mixture_models_Theory_geometry_and_applications","242404681_MCLUST_Version_3_for_R_Normal_mixture_modeling_and_model-based_clustering","240367010_How_Many_Clusters_Which_Clustering_Method_Answers_Via_Model-BasedCluster_Analysis","236647144_Clustering_Visualizations_of_Multidimensional_Data","232396353_Mixtures_of_modified_t-factor_analyzers_for_model-based_clustering_classification_and_discriminant_analysis","229100480_Statistical_Analysis_of_Finite_Mixture_Distributions","227652228_Model-based_clustering_of_longitudinal_data","226946139_Extending_mixtures_of_multivariate","226341438_Parsimonious_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","226069858_Weakly_Homoscedastic_Constraints_for_Mixtures_of_t-Distributions","222862063_Gaussian_Parsimonious_Clustering_Models","222826964_Model-based_clustering_for_longitudinal_data","222422416_Extension_of_the_mixture_of_factor_analyzers_model_to_incorporate_the_multivariate_distribution","222309020_Model-based_classification_using_latent_Gaussian_mixture_models","222278782_Model-based_classification_via_mixtures_of_multivariate_-distributions","221996717_Objective_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_Clustering_Methods","221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm","221345061_Mixtures_of_Factor_Analyzers","220055932_Serial_and_parallel_implementations_of_model-based_clustering_via_parsimonious_Gaussian_mixture_models","38364607_A_Maximization_Technique_Occurring_in_Statistical_Analysis_of_Probabilistic_Functions_of_Markov_Chains","31361470_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_via_the_ECM_Algorithm_A_General_Framework","38359692_Consistent_Estimation_of_a_Mixing_Distribution","38358303_Estimating_the_Dimension_of_a_Model","34843023_The_development_of_objective_criteria_for_evaluating_clustering_methods","31400969_Estimating_the_Components_of_a_Mixture_of_Two_Normal_Distribution"]}
