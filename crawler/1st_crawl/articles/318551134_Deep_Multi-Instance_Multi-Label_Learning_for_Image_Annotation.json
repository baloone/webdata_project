{"id":"318551134_Deep_Multi-Instance_Multi-Label_Learning_for_Image_Annotation","abstract":"Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning (MIML) is a popular framework for supervised classification where an example is described by multiple instances and associated with multiple labels. Previous MIML approaches have focused on predicting labels for instances. The idea of tackling the problem is to identify its equivalence in the traditional supervised learning framework. Motivated by the recent advancement in deep learning, in this paper, we still consider the problem of predicting labels and attempt to model deep learning in MIML learning framework. The proposed approach enables us to train deep convolutional neural network with images from social networks where images are well labeled, even labeled with several labels or uncorrelated labels. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","authors":["Haifeng Guo","Lixin Han","Shoubao Su","Zhoubao Sun"],"meta":["July 2017International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence 32(03)","DOI:10.1142/S021800141859005X"],"references":["6576878_Supervised_Learning_of_Semantic_Classes_for_Image_Annotation_and_Retrieval","5431822_Real-Time_Computerized_Annotation_of_Pictures","292724996_The_9th_annual_MLSP_competition_New_methods_for_acoustic_classification_of_multiple_simultaneous_bird_species_in_a_noisy_environment_Machine_Learning_for_Signal_Processing_MLSP","275055741_Structured_Visual_Feature_Learning_for_Classification_via_Supervised_Probabilistic_Tensor_Factorization","260712605_Sparse_Multi-Modal_Hashing","222430151_Learning_multi-label_scene_classification","2948781_Logistic_Regression_and_Boosting_for_Labeled_Bags_of_Instances"]}
