{"id":"220686132_Bent_and_Hyper-Bent_Functions_in_Polynomial_Form_and_Their_Link_With_Some_Exponential_Sums_and_Dickson_Polynomials","abstract":"Bent functions are maximally nonlinear Boolean functions with an even number of variables. They were intro- duced by Rothaus in 1976. For their own sake as interesting combinatorial objects, but also because of their relations to coding theory (Reed-Muller codes) and applications in cryptography (design of stream ciphers), they have attracted a lot of research, specially in the last 15 years. The class of bent functions contains a subclass of functions, introduced by Youssef and Gong in 2001, the so-called hyper-bent functions, whose properties are still stronger and whose elements are still rarer than bent functions. Bent and hyper-bent functions are not classified. A complete classification of these functions is elusive and looks hopeless. So, it is important to design constructions in order to know as many of (hyper)-bent functions as possible. This paper is devoted to the constructions of bent and hyper-bent Boolean functions in polynomial forms. We survey and present an overview of the constructions discovered recently. We extensively investigate the link between the bentness property of such functions and some exponential sums (involving Dickson polynomials) and give some conjectures that lead to constructions of new hyper-bent functions.
