{"id":"355885194_Perceived_Peer_Exclusion_as_Predictor_of_Students'_Help-Seeking_Strategies_in_Higher_Education_Differences_by_Gender_and_University_Major","abstract":"Feeling excluded by fellow students may be associated with lower levels of adaptive help-seeking. In a cross-sectional study, we compared self-reported help-seeking strategies (autonomy-oriented, dependency-oriented, help-seeking avoidance) among N = 418 students in 25 seminar and tutorial groups in the undergraduate introductory courses of two subject domains: computer science and education. Analyses showed that, overall, students reported lower autonomy-oriented help-seeking and higher help-seeking avoidance in computer science than in education. In computer science, perceived peer exclusion predicted more help-seeking avoidance among both male and female students and less autonomy-oriented help-seeking among females. In education, however, perceived peer exclusion was a significant predictor of both male and female students’ lower autonomy-oriented help-seeking. Results suggest that, in computer science, help-seeking appears to have an “image problem” signaling competence-related inferiority rather than being a form of effective self-regulated learning. Implications for enhancing adaptive help exchange cultures in computer science are discussed.","authors":["Lysann Zander","Elisabeth Höhne"],"meta":["November 2021Zeitschrift für Entwicklungspsychologie und Pädagogische Psychologie 53(1-2):27-41","DOI:10.1026/0049-8637/a000235"],"references":["342461535_Outperforming_yet_undervalued_Undergraduate_women_in_STEM","336918251_The_Role_of_Social_and_Ability_Belonging_in_Men's_and_Women's_pSTEM_Persistence","335082600_Sources_of_Male_and_Female_Students'_Belonging_Uncertainty_in_the_Computer_Sciences","333430906_Beliefs_in_Brilliance_and_Belonging_Uncertainty_in_Male_and_Female_STEM_StudentsTable_1docx","342612735_Barriers_to_academic_help-seeking_the_relationship_with_gender-typed_attitudes","340358115_Theories_in_use_that_explain_adolescent_help_seeking_and_avoidance_in_mathematics","340141009_Social_climate_and_help-seeking_avoidance_in_secondary_mathematics_classes","338156685_College_Students'_Sense_of_Belonging_A_National_Perspective","334182576_Visualizing_Gendered_Representations_of_Male_and_Female_Teachers_Using_a_Reverse_Correlation_Paradigm","332794014_Who_asks_whom_for_help_in_mathematics_A_sociometric_analysis_of_adolescents'_help-seeking_within_and_beyond_clique_boundaries"]}
