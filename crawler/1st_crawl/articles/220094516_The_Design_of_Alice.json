{"id":"220094516_The_Design_of_Alice","abstract":"This article explores the major design characteristics (both pedagogic as well as technical) that helped to shape Alice 2. It identifies several strengths of Alice as well as several weaknesses. An example problem is solved in Alice, covering many of the design characteristics. Finally, the effects and impacts of Alice instruction are presented, and the future directions of Alice development are provided.","authors":["Stephen Cooper"],"meta":["November 2010ACM Transactions on Computing Education 10(4):15","DOI:10.1145/1868358.1868362","SourceDBLP"],"references":["274309848_Computational_Thinking","234820045_Objects_visualization_of_behavior_and_state","234814597_Exploring_the_role_of_visualization_and_engagement_in_computer_science_education","220808237_Student_well-being_in_a_Computing_department","220612962_Evaluating_the_Educational_Impact_of_Visualization_Report_of_the_Working_Group_on_Evaluating_the_Educational_Impact_of_Visualization","285655290_Objects","245347469_An_invitation_to_Computer_Science","242542592_Karel_the_robot_a_gentle_introduction_to_the_art_of_programming_second_edition","242393297_Learning_to_Program_with_Alice","238281155_No_Silver_Bullet-Essence_and_Accident","234800080_How_to_Solve_It_by_Computer","234794185_Teaching_computer_science_in_context","228328531_Karel_the_Robot_A_Gentle_Introduction_to_the_Art_of_Programming","222408779_A_Meta-Study_of_Algorithm_Visualization_Effectiveness","221519949_Software_Visualization","220955859_Algorithm_Visualization_in_CS_Education_Comparing_Levels_of_Student_Engagement","220807846_Does_it_help_to_have_some_programming_experience_before_beginning_a_computing_degree_program"]}
