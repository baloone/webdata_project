{"id":"319770131_DeepFool_a_simple_and_accurate_method_to_fool_deep_neural_networks","abstract":"State-of-the-art deep neural networks have achieved impressive results on\nmany image classification tasks. However, these same architectures have been\nshown to be unstable to small, well sought, perturbations of the images.\nDespite the importance of this phenomenon, no effective methods have been\nproposed to accurately compute the robustness of state-of-the-art deep\nclassifiers to such perturbations on large-scale datasets. In this paper, we\nfill this gap and propose the DeepFool framework to efficiently compute\nperturbations that fools deep network and thus reliably quantify the robustness\nof arbitrary classifiers. Extensive experimental results show that our approach\noutperforms recent methods in the task of computing adversarial perturbations\nand making classifiers more robust. To encourage reproducible research, the\ncode of DeepFool will be available online.","authors":["Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli","Alhussein Fawzi","Pascal Frossard"],"meta":["November 2016"],"references":["307560165_Deep_neural_networks_are_easily_fooled_High_confidence_predictions_for_unrecognizable_images","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","272195158_Analysis_of_classifiers'_robustness_to_adversarial_perturbations","269935591_Explaining_and_Harnessing_Adversarial_Examples","269722671_Towards_Deep_Neural_Network_Architectures_Robust_to_Adversarial_Examples","269280482_Deep_Neural_Networks_Are_Easily_Fooled_High_Confidence_Predictions_for_Unrecognizable_Images","265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions","265777799_Nonlinear_Optimization","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","259440613_Intriguing_properties_of_neural_networks","241637478_Strategies_for_training_large_scale_neural_network_language_models","221376179_Convolutional_Networks_and_Applications_in_Vision","319770378_Explaining_and_harnessing_adversarial_examples","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","304417592_MatConvNet_convolutional_neural_networks_for_MATLAB","286860660_Deep_autoencoder_neural_networks_for_gene_ontology_annotation_predictions","280970055_What_Is_Holding_Back_Convnets_for_Detection","280329479_Manitest_Are_classifiers_really_invariant","269636298_MatConvNet_-_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_MATLAB","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","266259381_A_Deep_Learning_Network_Approach_to_ab_initio_Protein_Secondary_Structure_Prediction","260637318_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition_The_Shared_Views_of_Four_Research_Groups","252553420_Least_Change_Secant_Update_Methods_for_Undetermined_Systems","221089311_Object_Recognition_with_Gradient-Based_Learning"]}
