{"id":"313594211_Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants","abstract":"Young scholars in academia often seek to work in collaboration with top researchers in their field in pursuit of a successful career. While success in academia can be defined differently, everyone agrees that training with a well-known researcher can help lead to an efficacious career. This study aims to investigate whether collaborating with established scientists does, in fact, improve junior scholars' chances of success. If not, what makes young scientists soar in their academic careers? We investigate this question by analyzing the effect of collaboration with a known-star on success of a young scholar. The results suggest that working with leading experts can lead to a successful career, but that it is not the only way. Researchers who were not fortunate enough to start their career with an elite researcher could still succeed through hard work and passion. These findings emerged from analyses of two discrete sets of well-known scholars on the career of newcomers, suggesting their strength and validity.","authors":["Tehmina Amjad","Ying Ding","Jian xu","Chenwei Zhang"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Informetrics 11(1):307-323","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2017.01.004","Project: Scientometrics"],"references":["309691871_Data-driven_Discovery_A_New_Era_of_Exploiting_the_Literature_and_Data","306306253_Impact_of_mutual_influence_while_ranking_authors_in_a_co-authorship_network","287206575_Name_Disambiguation_by_Collective_Classification","282763469_Quality_versus_quantity_in_scientific_impact","276234409_Using_machine_learning_techniques_for_rising_star_prediction_in_co-author_network","275584784_Improving_Similarity_Measures_for_Publications_with_Special_Focus_on_Author_Name_Disambiguation","266025050_Author_Name_Disambiguation_Using_Vector_Space_Model_and_Hybrid_Similarity_Measures","262346065_A_Brief_Survey_of_Automatic_Methods_for_Author_Name_Disambiguation","260439659_Predicting_Scientific_Success_Based_on_Coauthorship_Networks","236596998_Finding_Rising_Stars_in_Social_Networks","235358635_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","230890815_Mentoring_Alternatives_The_Role_of_Peer_Relationships_in_Career_Development","230841691_Future_impact_Predicting_scientific_success","220788010_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","51986580_ArnetMiner_Extraction_and_Mining_of_Academic_Social_Networks","323836498_Finding_Rising_Stars_in_Social_Networks","307631671_The_pagerank_citation_ranking_Bringing_order_to_the_web","300552064_Will_This_Paper_Increase_Your_h-index","293014743_Can_Scientific_Impact_Be_Predicted","288933025_MuICE_Mutual_Influence_and_Citation_Exclusivity_Author_Rank","281493052_How_to_become_an_important_player_in_scientific_collaboration_networks","279593281_Social_Network_Theory_and_Analysis_A_Complementary_Lens_for_Inquiry","274645046_The_Child_is_Father_of_the_Man_Foresee_the_Success_at_the_Early_Stage","262816285_Publication_metrics_and_success_on_the_academic_job_market","254006037_To_better_stand_on_the_shoulder_of_giants","239800277_The_role_of_relationships_in_the_transition_from_doctoral_student_to_independent_scholar","236811936_Towards_a_Theory_of_Doctoral_Student_Professional_Identity_Development_A_Developmental_Networks_Approach","236204542_Scholarly_tailgating_defined_A_diverse_giant_network","234601610_Socialization_of_Graduate_and_Professional_Students_in_Higher_Education_A_Perilous_Passage_ASHE-ERIC_Higher_Education_Report_Volume_28_Number_3_Jossey-Bass_Higher_and_Adult_Education_Series","221996591_The_PageRank_Citation_Ranking_Bringing_Order_to_the_Web","220923865_Ranking_authors_in_digital_libraries","220907226_FutureRank_Ranking_Scientific_Articles_by_Predicting_their_Future_PageRank","220894848_A_Mixture_Model_for_Expert_Finding","220765084_A_Topic_Modeling_Approach_and_Its_Integration_into_the_Random_Walk_Framework_for_Academic_Search","46392186_Nurses_collaborating_with_cross_disciplinary_networks_starting_to_integrate_genomics_into_practice","7492196_An_Index_to_Quantify_An_Individual's_Scientific_Research_Output"]}
