{"id":"325107324_Formal_Modelling_of_Ontologies_An_Event-B_based_Approach_Using_the_Rodin_Platform","abstract":"This paper reports on the results of the French ANR IMPEX research project dealing with making explicit domain knowledge in design models. Ontologies are formalised as theories with sets, axioms, theorems and reasoning rules. They are integrated to design models through an annotation mechanism. Event-B has been chosen as the ground formal modelling technique for all our developments. In this paper, we particularly describe how ontologies are formalised as Event-B theories.","authors":["Yamine AÃ¯t-Ameur","Idir Ait Sadoune","Kahina Hacid","Linda Mohand Oussaid"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.271.2"],"references":["43652213_Rodin_An_Open_Toolset_for_Modelling_and_Reasoning_in_Event-B","319498267_Formal_Modelling_of_Domain_Constraints_in_Event-B","307853263_Annotation_of_Engineering_Models_by_References_to_Domain_Ontologies","305054745_Formal_Verification_of_Plastic_User_Interfaces_Exploiting_Domain_Ontologies","300459975_Integrating_Domain-Based_Features_into_Event-B_A_Nose_Gear_Velocity_Case_Study","287797502_Making_explicit_domain_knowledge_in_formal_system_development","281329465_On_Implicit_and_Explicit_Semantics_Integration_Issues_in_Proof-Based_Development_of_Systems","221473804_Knowledge_Models_to_Reduce_the_Gap_between_Heterogeneous_Models_Application_to_Aircraft_Systems_Engineering","220695465_Modeling_in_Event-B_-_System_and_Software_Engineering"]}
