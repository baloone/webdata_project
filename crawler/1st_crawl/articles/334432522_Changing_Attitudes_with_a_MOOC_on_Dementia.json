{"id":"334432522_Changing_Attitudes_with_a_MOOC_on_Dementia","abstract":"Introduction\nDementia is one of the most significant issues of our time and there are varying prevailing attitudes towards dementia, including negative stigma and perception. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a widely available online learning resource accessed for free which may present an opportunity to address prevailing attitudes.\n\nMethodology\nWe conducted a questionnaire before and after a six-week MOOC where participants learned about dementia. We collected data using a survey instrument and analysed them with statistical testing.\n\nResults and findings\nAlthough there was no statistically significant change between pre- and post-MOOC questionnaires, the change was observed in some questions and for particular groups.\n\nConclusion and recommendations\nOur findings indicate this MOOC has a greater effect on changing the attitudes of non-healthcare workers, older people and those living in the United Kingdom. We recommend further analysis of MOOC as a change intervention and consideration of their application in other disciplines.","authors":["David Robertshaw","Yasuhiro Kotera"],"meta":["July 2019European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning 22(2)","DOI:10.2478/eurodl-2019-0008"],"references":["322677357_The_relationship_between_work_motivation_and_worker_profile_in_UK_hospitality_workers","318770467_Never_say_die_Death_euphemisms_misunderstandings_and_their_implications_for_practice","312630942_Exploring_the_Factors_Associated_with_MOOC_Engagement_Retention_and_the_Wider_Benefits_for_Learners","302934635_'MOOC'_as_a_platform_for_social_learning_research_and_social_change_in_dementia","329486224_Roles_and_responsibilities_in_integrated_care_for_dementia","326895983_Care_of_the_Person_with_Dementia_Interprofessional_Practice_and_Education","318541573_Experiences_of_Integrated_Care_for_Dementia_from_Family_and_Carer_Perspectives_A_Framework_Analysis_of_Massive_Open_Online_Course_Discussion_Board_Posts","311247587_Team-Based_Interprofessional_Competency_Training_for_Dementia_Screening_and_Management","305362837_Evaluation_of_an_Audio-Visual_Novela_to_Improve_Beliefs_Attitudes_and_Knowledge_toward_Dementia_A_Mixed-Methods_Approach","304183971_A_New_Standard_in_Dementia_Knowledge_Measurement_Comparative_Validation_of_the_Dementia_Knowledge_Assessment_Scale_and_the_Alzheimer's_Disease_Knowledge_Scale"]}
