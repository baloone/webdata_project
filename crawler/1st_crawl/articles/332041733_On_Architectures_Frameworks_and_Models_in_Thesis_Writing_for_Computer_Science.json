{"id":"332041733_On_Architectures_Frameworks_and_Models_in_Thesis_Writing_for_Computer_Science","abstract":"Thesis writing can be a very complicated, confusing, and exhausting process. This paper looks at the why, how and when in using architectures, frameworks and models for thesis writing in computer science and related domains, as well as achieving clarity in thesis writing in general, with illustrations and examples. The underlying objects in computer science are data and processes, and these are put together into systems and applications. Architectures and frameworks are used to places all the components required to implement systems and applications, while models are used to mimic behaviour, and can then be used to explain, control, and predict. Good expositions of the relevant architectures, frameworks and models in a computer science thesis (or project) would then go a long way in situating the project, emphaising the main contributions, as well as determining what would be left for future work â€“ the basic ingredient for thesis writing (or project reports).","authors":["Zaharin Yusoff"],"meta":["December 2016Journal of IT in Asia 6(1):1-10","DOI:10.33736/jita.318.2016"],"references":["315869041_Queue_analysis_at_toll_plazas_inbound_A_basic_model_for_traffic_systems_towards_a_study_of_the_effect_on_toll_plazas_with_different_arrival_patterns"]}
