{"id":"324844564_A_survey_on_artifacts_from_CoNEXT_ICN_IMC_and_SIGCOMM_conferences_in_2017","abstract":"Reproducibility of artifacts is a cornerstone of most scientific publications. To improve the current state and strengthen ongoing community efforts towards reproducibility by design, we conducted a survey among the papers published at leading ACM computer networking conferences in 2017: CoNEXT, ICN, IMC, and SIGCOMM.\nThe objective of this paper is to assess the current state of artifact availability and reproducibility based on a survey. We hope that it will serve as a starting point for further discussions to encourage researchers to ease the reproduction of scientific work published within the SIGCOMM community. Furthermore, we hope this work will inspire program chairs of future conferences to emphasize reproducibility within the ACM SIGCOMM community as well as will strengthen awareness of researchers.","authors":["Matthias Flittner","Mohamed Naoufal Mahfoudi","Damien Saucez","Matthias WÃ¤hlisch"],"meta":["April 2018ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 48(1)","DOI:10.1145/3211852.3211864"],"references":["321237003_Studying_TLS_Usage_in_Android_Apps","321234622_On_the_Necessity_of_a_Prescribed_Block_Validity_Consensus_Analyzing_Bitcoin_Unlimited_Mining_Protocol","321233737_ZipNet-GAN_Inferring_Fine-grained_Mobile_Traffic_Patterns_via_a_Generative_Adversarial_Neural_Network","321068448_Broad_and_load-aware_anycast_mapping_with_verfploeter","321068300_An_empirical_characterization_of_IFTTT_ecosystem_usage_and_performance","321066274_Pinpointing_delay_and_forwarding_anomalies_using_large-scale_traceroute_measurements","321066165_Through_the_wormhole_tracking_invisible_MPLS_tunnels","320371004_Shortcuts_through_Colocation_Facilities","319926069_Now_content_sharing_application_over_NDN","319925607_Information-centric_networking_for_the_industrial_IoT","319925427_NFaaS_Named_Function_as_a_Service","319925208_Low-power_internet_of_things_with_NDN_cooperative_caching","319925199_Demo_named-data_networking_in_opportunistic_network","319924667_A_native_content_discovery_mechanism_for_the_information-centric_networks","318915565_RotorNet_A_Scalable_Low-complexity_Optical_Datacenter_Network","318915407_Who_is_Fiddling_with_Prices_Building_and_Deploying_a_Watchdog_Service_for_E-commerce","318914953_The_QUIC_Transport_Protocol_Design_and_Internet-Scale_Deployment","318914663_Bootstrapping_evolvability_for_inter-domain_routing_with_D-BGP","318652471_Constant_Time_Updates_in_Hierarchical_Heavy_Hitters","303856296_Bootstrapping_evolvability_for_inter-domain_routing_with_D-BGP","321237314_TCP_Congestion_Control_Beyond_Bandwidth-Delay_Product_for_Mobile_Cellular_Networks","321235017_Compressive_Millimeter-Wave_Sector_Selection_in_Off-the-Shelf_IEEE_8021_lad_Devices","321234926_Multipath_QUIC_Design_and_Evaluation","321230370_ECF_An_MPTCP_Path_Scheduler_to_Manage_Heterogeneous_Paths","321230209_MaxLength_Considered_Harmful_to_the_RPKI","321068624_Recursives_in_the_wild_engineering_authoritative_DNS_servers","321068616_Automatic_metadata_generation_for_active_measurement","321068615_Recursive_lattice_search_hierarchical_heavy_hitters_revisited","321068517_Fifteen_minutes_of_unwanted_fame_detecting_and_characterizing_doxing","321068370_Large-scale_scanning_of_TCP's_initial_window","321068369_A_high-performance_algorithm_for_identifying_frequent_items_in_data_streams","321068303_Tripwire_inferring_internet_site_compromise","321067872_liberate_n_a_library_for_exposing_traffic-classification_rules_and_avoiding_them_efficiently","321066265_The_record_route_option_is_an_option","321066163_High-resolution_measurement_of_data_center_microbursts","321066090_Mission_accomplished_HTTPS_security_after_diginotar","321066085_Your_state_is_not_mine_a_closer_look_at_evading_stateful_internet_censorship","319926245_The_need_for_a_name_to_MAC_address_mapping_in_NDN_towards_quantifying_the_resource_gain","319926068_Facilitating_ICN_deployment_with_an_extended_openflow_protocol","319925992_Virtualized_ICN_vICN_towards_a_unified_network_virtualization_framework_for_ICN_experimentation","319925949_A_unified_data_structure_of_name_lookup_for_NDN_data_plane","319925775_ICN_personalized_global-scale_testbed_using_GTS","319925342_Adaptive_forwarding_of_persistent_interests_in_named_data_networking","318916570_Beyond_fat-trees_without_antennae_mirrors_and_disco-balls","318915403_A_Formally_Verified_NAT","318915306_Neural_Adaptive_Video_Streaming_with_Pensieve","318915203_Dynamic_Service_Chaining_with_Dysco","318915202_SWIFT_Predictive_Fast_Reroute","318914891_Credit-Scheduled_Delay-Bounded_Congestion_Control_for_Datacenters","318914815_The_Impact_of_Router_Outages_on_the_AS-level_Internet","288280076_GEANT_world_testbed_facility_Federated_and_distributed_testbeds_as_a_service_facility_of_GEANT","282667659_FIT_IoT-LAB_A_large_scale_open_experimental_IoT_testbed","265359778_ndnSIM_ndn_simulator_for_NS-3","303384968_Queues_Don't_Matter_When_You_Can_JUMP_Them","242617460_University_of_oregon_route_views_project"]}
