{"id":"323705387_Design_of_experiments_application_concepts_examples_State_of_the_art","abstract":"Design of Experiments (DOE) is statistical tool deployed in various types of system, process and product design, development and optimization. It is multipurpose tool that can be used in various situations such as design for comparisons, variable screening, transfer function identification, optimization and robust design. This paper explores historical aspects of DOE and provides state of the art of its application, guides researchers how to conceptualize, plan and conduct experiments, and how to analyze and interpret data including examples. In addition, this paper reveals that in past 20 years application of DOE have been growing rapidly in manufacturing as well as non-manufacturing industries. It was most popular tool in scientific areas of medicine, engineering, biochemistry, physics, computer science and counts about 50% of its applications compared to all other scientific areas.","authors":["Benjamin Durakovic"],"meta":["December 2017Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences (PEN) 5(3):421-439","DOI:10.21533/pen.v5i3.145"],"references":["316667504_Simulation_and_experimental_validation_of_phase_change_material_and_water_used_as_heat_storage_medium_in_window_applications","310625791_Experimental_and_numerical_study_of_a_PCM_window_model_as_a_thermal_energy_storage_unit","301695145_The_Interrelationships_between_Quality_Management_Practices_and_Their_Effects_on_Innovation_Performance","322864005_Linking_BIM_and_Design_of_Experiments_to_balance_architectural_and_technical_design_factors_for_energy_performance","321277913_Textile_Cutting_Process_Optimization_Model_Based_on_Six_Sigma_Methodology_in_a_Medium-Sized_Company","321271995_Design_of_experiments_and_regression_modelling_in_food_flavour_and_sensory_analysis_A_review","319165574_Design_of_experiments_for_microencapsulation_applications_a_review","317114306_Design_of_Computer_Experiments_A_Review","315851493_Design_of_experiments_for_microencapsulation_applications_A_review","305826413_Analysis_of_a_solar_desalinator_humidification-dehumidification_cycle_including_a_compound_system_consisting_of_a_solar_humidifier_and_subsurface_condenser_using_DoE"]}
