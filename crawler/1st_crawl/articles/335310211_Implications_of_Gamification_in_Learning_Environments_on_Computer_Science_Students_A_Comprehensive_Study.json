{"id":"335310211_Implications_of_Gamification_in_Learning_Environments_on_Computer_Science_Students_A_Comprehensive_Study","abstract":"Gamification usually refers to the use of video game mechanics in existing processes and activities which are not related to video games. The purpose of using game elements is to increase the participants’ engagement and enjoyment. This notion has been growing in popularity over the years, especially among education researchers, since game elements provide a challenge to players and motivate them to set goals in the learning environment. using gamification can provide an optimal context to change the behavior and improve the users’ engagement and performance. However, designing gamification requires determining the target group and understanding their needs and factors such as gender, age, and cultural orientations since they can change gamification reception. Also,\nGamification is in its initial steps regarding behavior change which is one of the most challenging fields of human science.\nThere are many applications that use game elements to enhance students’\nparticipation and enjoyment. This discusses a review of different studies in different fields along with main findings and suggestions.","authors":["Leila Zahedi","Monique Ross","Jasmine Batten"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.18260/1-2--32946","Conference: ASEEAt: Tampa, FL","Project: Gamification- STEM-CYLE/SEP-CyLE"],"references":["336414212_Gender_Inclusivity_Dissemination_Guidelines","320372920_Gamification_in_Computer_Programming_Effects_on_learning_engagement_self-efficacy_and_intrinsic_motivation","344839591_Sectionality_or_Why_Section_Determines_Grades_an_Exploration_of_Engineering_Core_Course_Section_Grades_using_a_Hierarchical_Linear_Model_and_the_Multiple-Institution_Database_for_Investigating_Enginee","344481630_A_snapshot_of_rural_and_frontier_America","323412458_A_Computer-Based_Game_That_Promotes_Mathematics_Learning_More_Than_a_Conventional_Approach","321664337_Gamification_in_Software_Engineering_Education_An_Empirical_Study","315472671_Gamification_to_Engage_and_Motivate_Students_to_Achieve_Computer_Science_Learning_Goals","313685460_Development_of_a_game-design_workshop_to_promote_young_girls'_interest_towards_computing_through_identity_exploration","312454820_Designing_Gamification_in_the_Right_Way","305465792_The_multiple-institution_database_for_investigating_engineering_longitudinal_development_An_experiential_case_study_of_data_sharing_and_Reuse"]}
