{"id":"288069444_The_Myers-Briggs_Personality_Type_and_Its_Relationship_to_Computer_Programming","abstract":"This research investigated whether college students with certain personality types (as measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) performed better in an introductory programming class than students with the opposite personality types. A pilot study of 24 students and a follow-up study of 114 college students taking an introductory programming class indicated that sensing students performed better on programming assignments than intuitive students, and that judging students achieved higher programming averages than perceptive students. Additionally, it was found that personality type influenced achievement in programming performance, but did not influence achievement on exams or overall average.","authors":["Bishop-Clark Catherine","Daniel D.
