{"id":"225127628_A_Compact_Rijndael_Hardware_Architecture_with_S-Box_Optimization","abstract":"Compact and high-speed hardware architectures and logic optimization methods for the AES algorithm Rijndael are described.\nEncryption and decryption data paths are combined and all arithmetic components are reused. By introducing a new composite\nfield, the S-Box structure is also optimized. An extremely small size of 5.4 Kgates is obtained for a 128-bit key Rijndael\ncircuit using a 0.11-Î¼mCMOS standard cell library. It requires only 0.052 mm2 of area to support both encryption and decryption with 311 Mbps throughput. By making effective use of the SPN parallel feature,\nthe throughput can be boosted up to 2.6 Gbps for a high-speed implementation whose size is 21.3 Kgates.","authors":["Akashi Satoh","Sumio Morioka","Kohji Takano","Seiji Munetoh"],"meta":["November 2001","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45682-1_15","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security: Advances in Cryptology"],"references":["221291825_High_Performance_Single-Chip_FPGA_Rijndael_Algorithm_Implementations","221291817_Two_Methods_of_Rijndael_Implementation_in_Reconfigurable_Hardware","221291619_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221005718_Comparison_of_the_Hardware_Performance_of_the_AES_Candidates_Using_Reconfigurable_Hardware","239954254_Efficient_Rijndael_implementation_with_composite_field_arithmetic","221291858_Architectural_Optimization_for_a_182Gbitssec_VLSI_Implementation_of_the_AES_Rijndael_Algorithm","221005712_An_FPGA_Implementation_and_Performance_Evaluation_of_the_AES_Block_Cipher_Candidate_Algorithm_Finalists","221005707_A_Comparison_of_the_AES_Candidates_Amenability_to_FPGA_Implementation","221005704_Hardware_Evaluation_of_the_AES_Finalists","3826709_Design_methodology_for_a_one-shot_Reed-Solomon_encoder_and_decoder"]}
