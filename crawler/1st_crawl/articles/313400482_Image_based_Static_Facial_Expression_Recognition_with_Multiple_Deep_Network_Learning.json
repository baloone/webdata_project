{"id":"313400482_Image_based_Static_Facial_Expression_Recognition_with_Multiple_Deep_Network_Learning","abstract":"We report our image based static facial expression recognition method for the Emotion Recognition in the Wild Challenge (EmotiW) 2015. We focus on the sub-challenge of the SFEW 2.0 dataset, where one seeks to automatically classify a set of static images into 7 basic emotions. The proposed method contains a face detection module based on the ensemble of three state-of-the-art face detectors, followed by a classification module with the ensemble of multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Each CNN model is initialized randomly and pre-trained on a larger dataset provided by the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) Challenge 2013. The pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on the training set of SFEW 2.0. To combine multiple CNN models, we present two schemes for learning the ensemble weights of the network responses: by minimizing the log likelihood loss, and by minimizing the hinge loss. Our proposed method generates state-of-the-art result on the FER dataset. It also achieves 55.96% and 61.29% respectively on the validation and test set of SFEW 2.0, surpassing the challenge baseline of 35.96% and 39.13% with significant gains.","authors":["Zhiding Yu","Cha Zhang"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1145/2818346.2830595","Conference: the 2015 ACM"],"references":["305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","289927087_Combining_Multimodal_Features_with_Hierarchical_Classifier_Fusion_for_Emotion_Recognition_in_the_Wild","289926973_Emotion_Recognition_in_the_Wild_with_Feature_Fusion_and_Multiple_Kernel_Learning","285204187_Facial_Expression_Recognition_via_a_Boosted_Deep_Belief_Network","281276446_Emotion_Recognition_In_The_Wild_Challenge_2014_Baseline_Data_and_Protocol","266654836_Multiple_kernel_learning_for_emotion_recognition_in_the_wild","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","262313360_Emotion_Recognition_In_The_Wild_Challenge_2013","256575180_A_Semi-Automatic_Method_for_Collecting_Richly_Labelled_Large_Facial_Expression_Databases_from_Movies","243964130_Challenges_in_Representation_Learning_A_Report_on_Three_Machine_Learning_Contests","224165246_The_Extended_Cohn-Kanade_Dataset_CK_A_complete_dataset_for_action_unit_and_emotion-specified_expression","221429947_Static_facial_expression_analysis_in_tough_conditions_Data_evaluation_protocol_and_benchmark","221266405_The_SEMAINE_corpus_of_emotionally_coloured_character_interactions","220320677_Adaptive_Subgradient_Methods_for_Online_Learning_and_Stochastic_Optimization","42803851_Automatic_Recognition_of_Facial_Actions_in_Spontaneous_Expressions","23493444_A_Survey_of_Affect_Recognition_Methods_Audio_Visual_and_Spontaneous_Expressions","7864722_A_video_database_of_moving_faces_and_people","4181246_Web-based_database_for_facial_expression_analysis","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","312988531_The_semaine_corpus_of_emotionally_coloured_character_interactions","312831093_Deeply_Learning_Deformable_Facial_Action_Parts_Model_for_Dynamic_Expression_Analysis","312727767_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","286594780_Learning_Expressionlets_on_Spatio-temporal_Manifold_for_Dynamic_Facial_Expression_Recognition","286299355_Combining_Multiple_Kernel_Methods_on_Riemannian_Manifold_for_Emotion_Recognition_in_the_Wild","285671424_Joint_Cascade_Face_Detection_and_Alignment","269299894_Improving_multiview_face_detection_with_multi-task_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","266654707_Partial_least_squares_regression_on_Grassmannian_manifold_for_emotion_recognition","265929534_Introducing_the_Geneva_Multimodal_Emotion_Portrayal_GEMEP_corpus","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","262165643_Combining_modality_specific_deep_neural_networks_for_emotion_recognition_in_video","261306328_Face_Detection_Pose_Estimation_and_Landmark_Localization_in_the_Wild","239449334_A_dynamic_facial_expression_database","237000269_Deep_Learning_using_Linear_Support_Vector_Machines","234131103_Stochastic_Pooling_for_Regularization_of_Deep_Convolutional_NeuralNetworks","221497515_Adaptive_Subgradient_Methods_for_Online_Learning_and_Stochastic_Optimization","221369111_Representing_shape_with_a_spatial_pyramid_kernel","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair","221156854_Blur_Insensitive_Texture_Classification_Using_Local_Phase_Quantization","44618705_Multi-PIE","6397809_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Local_Binary_Patterns_with_an_Application_to_Facial_Expressions"]}
