{"id":"257605618_Optimal_Control_and_the_Fibonacci_Sequence","abstract":"We bridge mathematical number theory with optimal control and show that a generalised Fibonacci sequence enters the control function of finite-horizon dynamic optimisation problems with one state and one control variable. In particular, we show that the recursive expression describing the first-order approximation of the control function can be written in terms of a generalised Fibonacci sequence when restricting the final state to equal the steady-state of the system. Further, by deriving the solution to this sequence, we are able to write the first-order approximation of optimal control explicitly. Our procedure is illustrated in an example often referred to as the Brock–Mirman economic growth model.","authors":["Thomas von Brasch","Johan Byström","Lars Petter Lystad"],"meta":["September 2012Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications 154(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10957-012-0061-2"],"references":["44199755_Using_Generalized_Fibonacci_Sequences_for_Solving_the_One-Dimensional_LQR_Problem_and_its_Discrete-Time_Riccati_Equation","271202119_Further_Mathematics_for_Economic_Analysis","230641322_Optimal_Control","228451973_Recursive_Macroeconomic_Theory","227458467_Numerical_Method_in_Economics","222565693_Linear-quadratic_approximation_external_habit_and_targeting_rules","222537354_Fibonacci_sequence_golden_section_Kalman_filter_and_optimal_control","220227204_Expressing_stochastic_filters_via_number_sequences","220226864_State_estimation_and_control_of_the_Fibonacci_system","34598193_A_successive_sweep_method_for_solving_optimal_programming_problems","5005688_Linear-Quadratic_Approximation_of_Optimal_Policy_Problems","4976443_Optimal_economic_growth_and_uncertainty_The_discounted_case","4975746_A_Local_Analysis_of_n-Sector_Capital_Accumulation_under_Uncertainty","4975745_Some_New_Results_on_the_Local_Stability_of_the_Process_of_Capital_Accumulation"]}
