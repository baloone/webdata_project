{"id":"243773782_Spatial_representation_and_reasoning_in_RCC8_with_Boolean_region_terms","abstract":"We extend the expressive power of the region connec- tion calculus RCC-8 by allowing to apply the 8 binary relations of RCC-8 not only to atomic regions but also to Boolean combinations of them. It is shown that the statisfiability problem for the e xtended language in arbitrary topological spaces is still in NP; how ever, it be- comes PSPACE-complete if only the Euclidean spaces , , are regarded as possible interpretations. In particular, i n contrast to pure RCC-8, the new language is capable of distinguishing between connected and non-connected topological spaces.","authors":["Frank Wolter","Michael Zakharyaschev"],"meta":["January 2000"],"references":[]}
