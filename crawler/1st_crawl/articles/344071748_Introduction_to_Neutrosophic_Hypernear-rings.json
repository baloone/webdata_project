{"id":"344071748_Introduction_to_Neutrosophic_Hypernear-rings","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the introduction of neutrosophic hypernear-rings. The concept of neutrosophic A−hypergroup of a hypernear-ring A, neutrosophic A(I)− hypergroup of a neutrosophic hypernear-ring A(I) and their respective neutrosophic substructures are defined. We investigate and present some interesting results arising from the study of hypernear-rings in neutrosophic environment. It is shown that a constant neutrosophic hypernear-ring in general is not a constant hypernear-ring. In addition, we consider the neutrosophic ideals, neutrosophic homomorphism and neutrosophic quotient hypernear-rings of neutrosophic hypernear-rings.","authors":["Muritala Abiodun Ibrahim","Agboola Adesina Aa"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.4001123","Project: Neutrosophic Algebraic Structure"],"references":["343933792_On_Refined_Neutrosophic_Hypervector_Spaces","343906233_On_Refined_Neutrosophic_Algebraic_Hyperstructures_I","343906085_On_Refined_Neutrosophic_Hypergroup","343906045_On_Neutrosophic_Quadruple_Hypervector_Spaces","340860839_Introduction_to_Neutrosophic_Subtraction_Algebra_and_Neutrosophic_Subtraction_Semigroup","334480044_Refined_neutrosophic_quadruple_po-hypergroups_and_their_fundamental_group","319932518_Neutrosophic_quadruple_algebraic_hyperstructures","308949615_Basic_Neutrosophic_Algebraic_Structures_and_Their_Application_to_Fuzzy_and_Neutrosophic_Models","308790042_Neutrosophic_Hypervector_Spaces","308789893_On_Neutrosophic_Canonical_Hypergroups_and_Neutrosophic_Hyperrings"]}
