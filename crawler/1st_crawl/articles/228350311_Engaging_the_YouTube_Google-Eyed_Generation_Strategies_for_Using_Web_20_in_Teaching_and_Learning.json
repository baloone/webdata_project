{"id":"228350311_Engaging_the_YouTube_Google-Eyed_Generation_Strategies_for_Using_Web_20_in_Teaching_and_Learning","abstract":"YouTube, Podcasting, Blogs, Wikis and RSS are buzz words currently associated with the term Web 2.0 and represent a shifting pedagogical paradigm for the use of a new set of tools within education. The implication here is a possible shift from the basic archetypical vehicles used for (e)learning today (lecture notes, printed material, PowerPoint, websites, animation) towards a ubiquitous user-centric, user-content generated and user-guided experience. It is not sufficient to use online learning and teaching technologies simply for the delivery of content to students. A new \"Learning Ecology\" is present where these Web 2.0 technologies can be explored for collaborative and (co)creative purposes as well as for the critical assessment, evaluation and personalization of information. Web 2.0 technologies provide educators with many possibilities for engaging students in desirable practices such as collaborative content creation, peer assessment and motivation of students through innovative use of media. These can be used in the development of authentic learning tasks and enhance the learning experience. However in order for a new learning tool, be it print, multimedia, blog, podcast or video, to be adopted, educators must be able to conceptualize the possibilities for use within a concrete framework. This paper outlines some possible strategies for educators to incorporate the use of some of these Web 2.0 technologies into the student learning experience.","authors":["Peter Duffy"],"meta":["January 2008"],"references":["312369677_Boomers_Gen-Xers_and_Millennials_Understanding_the_New_Students","271787795_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","264477172_E-Learning_and_the_Science_of_Instruction_Proven_Guidelines_for_Consumers_and_Designers_of_Multimedia_Learning","234695471_From_YouTube_to_YouNiversity","234640431_A_Different_Kind_of_Classroom_Teaching_with_Dimensions_of_Learning","229068410_Growing_Up_Digital_How_the_Web_Changes_Work_Education_and_the_Ways_People_Learn","220374515_The_Encyclopedia_of_Educational_Technology","220017733_Connectivism_A_Learning_Theory_for_the_Digital_Age","200772756_Blogs_Wikis_Podcasts_and_Other_Powerful_Web_Tools_for_Classroom","200772699_Web_20_A_New_Wave_of_Innovation_for_Teaching_and_Learning","200044647_Wikinomics_How_Mass_Collaboration_Changes_Everything"]}
