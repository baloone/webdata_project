{"id":"337147917_Digital_competencies_A_review_of_the_literature_and_applications_in_the_workplace","abstract":"In today's organisations and politics, there is a growing awareness of the gap between existing and needed digital competencies of the workforce to master the challenges of the digitalised future at work. Nevertheless, no comprehensive framework or definition of digital competencies at work has been proposed so far. Our aim is to offer a holistic view and broaden the scope of the concept of digital competencies, thereby focussing on applications at work. We combine diverse methods to integrate different perspectives on digital competencies. By conducting an extensive literature review about definitions and frameworks of digital competencies that might be applicable at work, we provide an overview of the current state of the art in research on digital competencies. Additionally, eleven half-structured interviews based on the critical incidents technique (CIT) were conducted to gain insights into the perspectives of professionals with expertise in digitalisation processes and digital competencies. Subsequently, researchers with different educational backgrounds clustered the results from both approaches and agreed on twenty-five dimensions that constitute digital competencies for white-collar workers with office jobs, encompassing a large variety of knowledge, skills, and abilities. The results of this research indicate that even though there is overlapping content, each perspective adds unique content to the concept of digital competencies at work. By creating a coherent and detailed framework and a definition, our research enhances the applicability of professional learning and development of digital competencies at work.","authors":["Maren Oberl√§nder","Andrea Beinicke","Tanja Bipp"],"meta":["November 2019Computers & Education 146:103752","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103752"],"references":["340375234_Mapping_Digital_Competence_Towards_a_Conceptual_Understanding","334654268_Transformative_agency_in_teacher_education_Fostering_professional_digital_competence","333916343_2019_Journal_Citation_Reports_SCIESSCI","320654580_Frameworks_for_Digital_Competence_Assessment_Proposals_Instruments_and_Evaluation","316343698_Undergraduate_Students'_Perspectives_on_Digital_Competence_and_Academic_Literacy_in_a_Spanish_University","299400943_How_Technology_Is_Changing_Work_and_Organizations","295833604_Delphi_study_for_the_design_and_validation_of_a_questionnaire_about_digital_competences_in_higher_education","293223688_Learning_to_Be_Developing_and_Understanding_Digital_Competence","288948663_Models_and_Instruments_for_assessing_Digital_Competence_at_School","288059219_Preservice_Teachers_and_Self-Assessing_Digital_Competence","282860020_DIGCOMP_a_Framework_for_Developing_and_Understanding_Digital_Competence_in_Europe","273945449_Digital_Competence_in_the_Knowledge_Society","271339073_Assessing_ICT_Competencies_among_Postgraduate_Students_Based_on_the_21st_Century_ICT_Competency_Model","262893172_Digital_literacy_and_informal_learning_environments_An_introduction","256460731_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","254415896_Confounded_by_Competencies_An_Evaluation_of_the_Evolution_and_Use_of_Competency_Models","250721430_Digital_Literacy_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Survival_Skills_in_the_Digital_Era","235266224_Information_and_digital_literacies_a_review_of_concepts","232432299_Measuring_Person-Job_Fit_Using_a_Profile_Comparison_Process","316573247_Digital_competences_of_the_workforce_-_a_research_topic","314217019_The_relation_between_21st-century_skills_and_digital_skills_A_systematic_literature_review","304813630_Competence_at_Work_Models_for_Superior_Performance","292237376_How_to_identify_and_understand_digital_literacy_among_9th_grade_Norwegian_students","284274895_Assessment_of_the_digital_competence_in_Russian_adolescents_and_parents_Digital_Competence_Index","270921980_Direct_measures_of_digital_information_processing_and_communication_skills_in_primary_education_Using_item_response_theory_for_the_development_and_validation_of_an_ICT_competence_scale","263601668_Workplace_basics_The_skills_employees_need_and_employers_want","261329892_Predictors_of_digital_competence_in_7th_grade_A_multilevel_analysis","257171162_Can_we_teach_digital_natives_digital_literacy","249631310_An_Integrative_Model_of_Competency_Development_Training_Design_Assessment_Center_and_Multi-Rater_Assessment","247427936_Psychology_Applied_to_Work_An_Introduction_to_Industrial_and_Organizational_Psychology","244476899_Experts'_views_on_digital_competence_Commonalities_and_differences","229919886_Doing_Competeniceis_Well_Best_Practices_in_Competency_Modeling","229906465_Are_'digital_natives'_really_digitally_competent-A_study_on_Chinese_teenagers","227991385_Writing_Research_Articles_Update_on_the_Article_Review_Checklist","220202787_Adapting_a_Face-To-Face_Competence_Framework_for_Digital_Competence_Assessment","216443758_Industrial_and_Organizational_Psychology_Research_and_Practice","32938321_DigEuLit_-_a_European_Framework_for_Digital_Literacy_a_Progress_Report","26467562_DigEuLit_Concepts_and_Tools_for_Digital_Literacy_Development","10363881_The_Critical_Incident_Technique","5499399_The_qualitative_content_analysis"]}
