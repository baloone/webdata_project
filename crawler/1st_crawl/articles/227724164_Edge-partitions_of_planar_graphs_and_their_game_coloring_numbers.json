{"id":"227724164_Edge-partitions_of_planar_graphs_and_their_game_coloring_numbers","abstract":"Let G be a planar graph and let g(G) and Δ(G) be its girth and maximum degree, respectively. We show that G has an edge-partition into a forest and a subgraph H so that (i) Δ(H) ≤ 4 if g(G) ≥ 5; (ii) Δ(H) ≤ 2 if g(G) ≥ 7; (iii) Δ(H)≤ 1 if g(G) ≥ 11; (iv) Δ(H) ≤ 7 if G does not contain 4-cycles (though it may contain 3-cycles). These results are applied to find the following upper bounds for the game coloring number colg(G) of a planar graph G: (i) colg(G) ≤ 8 if g(G) ≥ 5; (ii) colg(G)≤ 6 if g(G) ≥ 7; (iii) colg(G) ≤ 5 if g(G) ≥ 11; (iv) colg(G) ≤ 11 if G does not contain 4-cycles (though it may contain 3-cycles). © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
