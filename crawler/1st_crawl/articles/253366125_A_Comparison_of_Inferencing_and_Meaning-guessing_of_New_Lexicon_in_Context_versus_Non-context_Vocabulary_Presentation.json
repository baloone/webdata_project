{"id":"253366125_A_Comparison_of_Inferencing_and_Meaning-guessing_of_New_Lexicon_in_Context_versus_Non-context_Vocabulary_Presentation","abstract":"In a quasi-experimental study, the researcher used two approaches to vocabulary instruction with 34 Level III College of Languages and Translation students, enrolled in King Khalid University, KSA. The purpose of the study was to explore the effects of each approach. One strategy emphasized direct teaching of the individual meanings for a set of unfamiliar words. The second strategy emphasized teaching students to derive word meaning from sentence context, rather than teaching specific meanings. Pre-test/post-test comparisons indicate that both approaches were effective in helping students acquire, retain and further recall the lexical items instructed. The findings were discussed in relation to prior research, and implications as well as suggestions for vocabulary building material development were given at the end of the paper.","authors":["Mohammed A.
