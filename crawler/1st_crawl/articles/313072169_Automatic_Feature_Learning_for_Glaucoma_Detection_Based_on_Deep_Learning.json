{"id":"313072169_Automatic_Feature_Learning_for_Glaucoma_Detection_Based_on_Deep_Learning","abstract":"Glaucoma is a chronic and irreversible eye disease in which the optic nerve is progressively damaged, leading to deterioration in vision and quality of life. In this paper, we present an Automatic feature Learning for glAucoma Detection based on Deep LearnINg (ALADDIN), with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature learning. Different from the traditional convolutional layer that uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input, the adopted network embeds micro neural networks (multilayer perceptron) with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. Moreover, a contextualizing deep learning structure is proposed in order to obtain a hierarchical representation of fundus images to discriminate between glaucoma and non-glaucoma pattern, where the network takes the outputs from other CNN as the context information to boost the performance. Extensive experiments are performed on the ORIGA and SCES datasets. The results show area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve in glaucoma detection at 0.838 and 0.898 in the two databases, much better than state-of-the-art algorithms. The method could be used for glaucoma diagnosis.","authors":["Xiangyu Chen","Yanwu Xu","Shuicheng Yan","Damon Wing Kee Wong"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_80","Conference: International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention"],"references":["240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","234048515_Efficient_Optic_Cup_Detection_from_Intra-image_Learning_with_Retinal_Structure_Priors","228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors","51968606_Building_high-level_features_using_large_scale_unsupervised_learning","51724296_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","49626932_ORIGA-light_An_Online_Retinal_Fundus_Image_Database_for_Glaucoma_Analysis_and_Research","288520478_The_number_of_people_with_glaucoma_worldwide_in_2010_and_2020","267273938_Optic_Cup_Segmentation_for_Glaucoma_Detection_Using_Low-Rank_Superpixel_Representation","260127897_Efficient_Reconstruction-Based_Optic_Cup_Localization_for_Glaucoma_Screening","222081143_Optic_disc_size_an_important_consideration_in_the_glaucoma_evaluation","221965085_Determinants_of_Anterior_Chamber_Depth_The_Singapore_Chinese_Eye_Study","221757632_Automatic_optic_disc_segmentation_with_peripapillary_atrophy_elimination","45721107_Auto-Context_and_Its_Application_to_High-Level_Vision_Tasks_and_3D_Brain_Image_Segmentation","40450631_Intelligent_Fusion_of_Cup-to-Disc_Ratio_Determination_Methods_for_Glaucoma_Detection_in_ARGALI","21418659_Glaucomatous_Peripapillary_Atrophy_Occurrence_and_Correlations","14694524_Sensitivity_and_specificity_of_optic_disc_parameters_in_chronic_glaucoma","7288149_The_number_of_people_with_glaucoma_worldwide_in_2010_and_2020","6695629_The_ISNT_Rule_and_Differentiation_of_Normal_From_Glaucomatous_Eyes","4351110_Auto-context_and_its_application_to_high-level_vision_tasks"]}
