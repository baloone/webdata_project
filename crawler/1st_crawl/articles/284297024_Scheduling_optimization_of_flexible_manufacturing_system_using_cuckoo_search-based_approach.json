{"id":"284297024_Scheduling_optimization_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_using_cuckoo_search-based_approach","abstract":"In the present work, a cuckoo search (CS)-based approach has been developed for scheduling optimization of a flexible manufacturing system by minimizing the penalty cost due to delay in manufacturing and maximizing the machine utilization time. To demonstrate the application of cuckoo search (CS)-based scheme to find the optimum job, the proposed scheme has been applied with slight modification in its Levy flight operator because of the discrete nature of the solution on a standard FMS scheduling problem containing 43 jobs and 16 machines taken from literature. The CS scheme has been implemented using Matlab, and results have been compared with other soft computing-based optimization approaches like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization found in the literature. The results shown by CS-based approach have been found to outperform the results of existing heuristic algorithms such as GA for the given problem","authors":["S.
