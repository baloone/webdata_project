{"id":"260153678_Linearly_configured_BOCDA_system_using_a_differential_measurement_scheme","abstract":"We experimentally demonstrate a linearly configured Brillouin optical correlation domain analysis (BOCDA) system enhanced by a differential measurement scheme. On-off control of the pump phase modulation with an intentional loss at the end of a fiber under test is applied for the acquisition of a Brillouin gain spectrum. This application leads to a four-fold enhancement of the spatial resolution and doubling of the measurement range in comparison with the former system under the same modulation parameters.","authors":["Ji Ho Jeong","Kyu Hwang Chung","Sangbae Lee","Kwang Yong Song"],"meta":["January 2014Optics Express 22(2):1467-73","DOI:10.1364/OE.22.001467","SourcePubMed"],"references":["250581936_Measurement_of_Brillouin_Gain_Spectrum_Distribution_along_an_Optical_Fiber_Using_a_Correlation-Based_Technique-Proposal_Experiment_and_Simulation","233788407_Differential_measurement_scheme_for_Brillouin_Optical_Correlation_Domain_Analysis","224918152_Bidirectional_measurement_for_Brillouin_optical_correlation_domain_analysis","37464069_Simple_distributed_fiber_sensor_based_on_Brillouin_gain_spectrum_analysis","26889093_32-km_distributed_temperature_sensor_based_on_Brillouin_loss_in_an_optical_fiber","238115516_150-km-range_distributed_temperature_sensor_based_on_coherent_detection_of_spontaneous_Brillouin_backscatter_and_in-line_Raman_amplification","224345055_Brillouin_Optical_Correlation_Domain_Analysis_in_Linear_Configuration","224161785_Single-End-Access_Correlation-Domain_Distributed_Fiber-Optic_Sensor_Based_on_Stimulated_Brillouin_Scattering","6883960_Distributed_strain_measurement_with_millimeter-order_spatial_resolution_based_on_Brillouin_optical_correlation_domain_analysis","3295428_Distributed_Fiber_Strain_Sensor_With_1-kHz_Sampling_Rate_Based_on_Brillouin_Optical_Correlation_Domain_Analysis"]}
