{"id":"316756708_Design_and_Implementation_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_for_Mobile_Robot_based_on_FPGA","abstract":"The world has seen great interest in intelligent systems and its control methods because they are provided distinctive service to humanity in civil and military purposes. In this paper presented the design and implementation of the intelligent controller system by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for a laser mobile robot system to avoid obstacles in unknown environment. Back-Propagation (BP) method used to train the ANN. The system design was implemented and downloaded in FPGA board type Xilinx Spartan-3 XC3S700A. Four DC motor were used to move the mobile robot. The MATLAB program used to train the ANN. The mobile used IR sensors to detect the obstacles. The MSE get from the training the ANN is 3 * 10 âˆ’7 which is considered suitable accuracy in robotic system.","authors":["Ameer H. Ali","Hanan A. R.
