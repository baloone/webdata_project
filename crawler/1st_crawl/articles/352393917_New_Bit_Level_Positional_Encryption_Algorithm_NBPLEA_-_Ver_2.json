{"id":"352393917_New_Bit_Level_Positional_Encryption_Algorithm_NBPLEA_-_Ver_2","abstract":"In the age of the digital world, cyber security and protecting the digital assets of a person and organization are of the utmost importance. Various types of attackers and foreign entities attempt to break in and steal or modify records and valuable assets for their personal gain which is why designing efficient and unbreakable cryptographic algorithms is a very crucial field of Computer Science.[2] In this project, we develop a cryptographic algorithm that is able to encrypt small texts like passwords or pins.","authors":["Asoke Nath","Annie Chakraborty","Soumyaraj Maitra"],"meta":["May 2021International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology","DOI:10.32628/CSEIT217350"],"references":["287667994_Introduction_to_cryptography_and_network_security","286934407_Bit_Level_Encryption_Algorithm_--_Implementation_of_Bit-Wise_Operations_and_Randomized_Bit-Wise_Columnar_Transposition_Method","261079608_Bit_Level_Encryption_Standard_BLES_Version-II"]}
