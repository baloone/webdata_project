{"id":"255614882_Quantized_Frame_Expansions_with_Erasures_1","abstract":"This paper places frames in a new setting, where some of theelements are deleted. Since proper subsets of fi'ames are sometimes them-selves frames, a quantized frame expansion can be a useful representationeven when some transform coefficients are lost in transmission. This yieldsrobustness to losses in packet networks such as the Internet","authors":["Jonathan A.
