{"id":"298429837_Minimum_cost_inputoutput_design_for_large-scale_linear_structural_systems","abstract":"In this paper, we provide optimal solutions to two different (but related) input/output design problems involving large-scale linear dynamical systems, where the cost associated to each directly actuated/measured state variable can take different values, but is independent of the input/output performing the task. Under these conditions, we first aim to determine and characterize the input/output placement that incurs in the minimum cost while ensuring that the resulting placement achieves structural controllability/observability. Further, we address a constrained variant of the above problem, in which we seek to determine the minimum cost placement configuration, among all possible input/output placement configurations that ensures structural controllability/observability, with the lowest number of directly actuated/measured state variables. We develop new graph-theoretical characterizations of cost-constrained input selections for structural controllability and properties that enable us to address both problems by reduction to a weighted maximum matching problem â€” efficiently addressed by algorithms with polynomial time complexity (in the number of state variables). Finally, we illustrate the obtained results with an example.","authors":["Sergio Pequito","Soummya Kar","A.
