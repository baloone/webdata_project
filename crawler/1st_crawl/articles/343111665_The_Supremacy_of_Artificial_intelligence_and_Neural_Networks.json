{"id":"343111665_The_Supremacy_of_Artificial_intelligence_and_Neural_Networks","abstract":"The present study insights on the impact of artificial intelligence, coupled with neural networks. It has emerged as one of the tools for executing data science problems and performing rapid programming and processing. The neural network is recognized to be a mathematical function that converts a set of inputs into designated output components. These inputs might be the basis of computational learning. As there has been significant usage of these applications related to neural networks, the present study describes its importance in artificial intelligence.","authors":["Rahul Reddy Nadikattu"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1729/Journal.24071","Project: THE SUPREMACY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEURAL NETWORKS"],"references":["343179789_THE_EMERGING_ROLE_OF_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_IN_MODERN_SOCIETY","246404185_Hydrological_Modelling_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks","228824281_Elements_of_Artificial_Neural_Nets","280806206_Applications_of_artificial_neural-networks_for_energy_systems","272161313_Evolving_artificial_neural_networks","270917729_Fundamentals_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks","246528594_Introduction_to_Neural_Artificial_Systems","236846871_Neural_Smithing_Supervised_Learning_in_Feedforward_Artificial_Neural_Networks","236846832_Artificial_Neural_Networks_as_Rainfall-Runoff_Models","234795632_Artificial_Neural_Networks_Approximation_and_Learning_Theory"]}
