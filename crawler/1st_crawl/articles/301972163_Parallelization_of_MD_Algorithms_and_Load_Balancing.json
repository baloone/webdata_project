{"id":"301972163_Parallelization_of_MD_Algorithms_and_Load_Balancing","abstract":"MD simulation in process engineering features enormous computational demands, and therefore requires efficient parallelization techniques. This chapter describes ls1 mardyn ’s parallelization approach for shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures. This is done by first defining today’s computing architectures and their governing design principles: Heterogeneity, massive amounts of cores and data parallelism. Based on this, we are then able to reengineer ls1 mardyn in such a way that it can optimally leverage important hardware features, and describe our parallelization approach for shared- and distributed-memory systems at the example of the Intel Xeon processor and the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor, respectively. We close this section by describing load-balancing techniques in case of a distributed-memory parallelization and heterogeneous particle distributions in the computational domain.","authors":["Alexander Heinecke","Wolfgang Eckhardt","Martin Thomas Horsch","Hans-Joachim Bungartz"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-17148-7_3","In book: Supercomputing for Molecular Dynamics Simulations (pp.31-44)"],"references":["1766004_Harvesting_graphics_power_for_MD_simulations","259079400_Analysis_of_scalable_data-privatization_threading_algorithms_for_hybrid_MPIOpenMP_parallelization_of_molecular_dynamics","255825406_Zonal_methods_for_the_parallel_execution_of_range-limited_N-body_simulations","223276702_A_replicated_data_molecular_dynamics_strategy_for_the_parallel_Ewald_sum","222579828_Enhanced_molecular_dynamics_performance_with_a_programmable_graphics_processor","222411269_General_purpose_molecular_dynamics_simulations_fully_implemented_on_graphics_processing_units","222004174_Molecular-dynamics_simulations_of_Coulombic_systems_on_distributed-memory_MIMD_machines","220257289_Efficient_parallel_implementation_of_Ewald_summation_in_molecular_dynamics_simulations_on_multi-core_platforms","5951054_Accelerating_molecular_modeling_applications_with_graphics_processors_Journal_of_Computational_Chemistry_2816_2618-2640","2643507_Journal_of_Computational_Physics_vol_117_p_1--19_1_March_1995_Fast_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Short--Range_Molecular_Dynamics","2513226_Trace_Cache_a_Low_Latency_Approach_to_High_Bandwidth_Instruction_Fetching"]}
