{"id":"2549502_Question-Answering_Using_Semantic_Relation_Triples","abstract":"This paper describes the development of a prototype system to answer questions by selecting sentences from the documents in which the answers occur. After parsing each sentence in these documents, databases are constructed by extracting relational triples from the parse output. The triples consist of discourse entities, semantic relations, and the governing words to which the entities are bound in the sentence. Database triples are also generated for the questions. Question-answering consists of matching the question database records with the records for the documents.","authors":["Kenneth C.
