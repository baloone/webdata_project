{"id":"286680169_Extracting_Watermark_from_3D_Prints","abstract":"We propose a method of extracting watermark from 3D prints created from 3D mesh data. The watermark is embedded to the 3D mesh in the spectral domain using a robust, imperceptible, and informed algorithm based on the spread spectrum technique, and then extracted from 3D prints by reconstructing the 3D mesh homologous to the original. A suspect 3D mesh is reconstructed accurately and robustly from noisy and incomplete 3D scans of the 3D prints, by optimizing a sparse subset of the spectrum using a variant of the iterative closest point technique. The mesh is registered to the original mesh by construction, in terms of geometry and topology, which allows us to extract a suspect watermark by simple algebraic operations. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method using standard 3D datasets and multiple 3D printers. The proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods under different conditions in the practical scenario. The probability of false positive detection is kept less than 106 for the most cases of simulated and real data.","authors":["Shuntaro Yamazaki","Satoshi Kagami","Masaaki Mochimaru"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICPR.2014.783","Conference: 2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)"],"references":["238702324_Information_Hiding_Techniques_for_Steganography_and_Digital_Watermaking","221326514_A_Benchmark_for_3D_Mesh_Watermarking","220722198_Three-Dimensional_Meshes_Watermarking_Review_and_Attack-Centric_Investigation","200018891_Watermarking_3D_Polygonal_Meshes_in_the_Mesh_Spectral_Domain","3233969_Watermarking_Three-Dimensional_Polygonal_Models_Through_Geometric_And_Topological_Modifications","3191994_A_method_for_registration_of_3-D_shapes_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell","2417323_Surface_Simplification_Using_Quadric_Error_Metrics","2403210_Spectral_Compression_of_Mesh_Geometry","2330233_The_Digital_Michelangelo_Project_3D_Scanning_of_Large_Statues","312152791_Poisson_surface_reconstruction","303517837_Numerical_recipes_in_C","277482152_Digital_Watermarking","269031968_The_digital_Michelangelo_project","236177869_Trust_Region_Methods","221316529_Screened_Poisson_Surface_Reconstruction","220183320_A_Method_for_Registration_of_3-D_Shapes","200621929_Modern_Graph_Theory","200018926_Robust_Mesh_Watermarking","5567414_Secure_spread_spectrum_watermarking_for_multimedia","3897594_Efficient_Variants_of_the_ICP_Algorithm"]}
