{"id":"324994020_Big_data_analysis_for_brain_tumor_detection_Deep_convolutional_neural_networks","abstract":"Brain tumor detection is an active area of research in brain image processing. In this work, a methodology is proposed to segment and classify the brain tumor using magnetic resonance images (MRI). Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based architecture is employed for tumor segmentation. In the proposed model, 07 layers are used for classification that consist of 03 convolutional, 03 ReLU and a softmax layer. First the input MR image is divided into multiple patches and then the center pixel value of each patch is supplied to the DNN. DNN assign labels according to center pixels and perform segmentation. Extensive experiments are performed using eight large scale benchmark datasets including BRATS 2012 (image dataset and synthetic dataset), 2013 (image dataset and synthetic dataset), 2014, 2015 and ISLES (Ischemic stroke lesion segmentation) 2015 and 2017. The results are validated on accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), precision, false positive rate (FPR), true positive rate (TPR) and Jaccard similarity index (JSI) respectively.","authors":["Javeria Amin","Muhammad Sharif","Yasmin Mussarat","Steven Lawrence Fernandes"],"meta":["May 2018Future Generation Computer Systems 87","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2018.04.065"],"references":["249965866_Brain_tumor_detection_and_segmentation_in_a_CRF_conditional_random_fields_framework_with_pixel-pairwise_affinity_and_superpixel-level_features"]}
