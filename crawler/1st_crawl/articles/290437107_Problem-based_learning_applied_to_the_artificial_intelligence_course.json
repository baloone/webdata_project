{"id":"290437107_Problem-based_learning_applied_to_the_artificial_intelligence_course","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to present a problem-based learning (PBL) proposal for use in the Artificial Intelligence course. The proposal includes problems associated with the area of mobile robotics, in which the student develops artificial intelligence solutions to optimize the movement of a robot in an unknown environment, avoiding obstacles. The proposed method was applied during three semesters (2012.1, 2013.1, and 2013.2), in the Applied Artificial Intelligence course of the Computational Engineering programme at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. The results obtained in opinion surveys with the students during the three semesters are presented with the aim of validating the PBL proposal. The responses obtained in the opinion surveys show that the proposed method was well received, given that more than 80% of the responses were positive. Details of the implementation of the proposal are provided in order to assist others involved in the teaching of similar academic programme.","authors":["Marcelo Augusto Costa Fernandes"],"meta":["February 2016Computer Applications in Engineering Education 24(3)","DOI:10.1002/cae.21717"],"references":["264081345_Monthly_Inflow_Forecasting_Using_Autoregressive_Artificial_Neural_Network","261397801_The_Cost_of_Problem-Based_Learning_An_Example_in_Information_Systems_Engineering","261323733_Genetic_Algorithm-Based_Navigation_Strategy_For_Mobile_Terrestrial_Robots","261041483_PBL_in_teaching_computing_An_overview_of_the_last_15_years","258792932_A_One-Year_Introductory_Robotics_Curriculum_for_Computer_Science_Upperclassmen","258397754_On_Metric_Dimension_of_Some_Rotationally_Symmetric_Graphs","215480946_Peer_Review_To_Improve_Artificial_Intelligence_Teaching","3955443_The_development_of_Internet-based_laboratory_environments_for_teaching_robotics_and_artificial_intelligence","3050887_Teaching_Introductory_Autonomous_Robotics_With_JavaScript_Simulations_and_Actual_Robots","318680574_Teaching_of_artificial_intelligence_courses_based_on_design_based_research","283690884_Open_hardware_modular_educational_robotic_platform_-_Yrobot","279311649_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_Game_Artificial_Intelligence_Education_Using_Angry_Birds","273395655_ReAct_An_Interactive_Educational_Tool_for_AI_Planning_for_Robotics","271517893_Using_Semantic_Web_Technologies_in_a_Web_Based_System_for_Personalized_Learning_AI_Course","264737047_Neural_equalization_applied_to_systems_with_bidimensional_digital_modulation","263653095_Dynamic_planning_navigation_strategy_for_mobile_terrestrial_robots","261111757_A_PBL_approach_to_process_management_applied_to_Software_Engineering_education","260375727_INSOS-Educational_system_for_teaching_intelligent_systems","259667947_INSOS-Educational_System_for_Teaching_Intelligent_Systems","256756897_Comparison_of_the_ARMA_ARIMA_and_the_autoregressive_artificial_neural_network_model_in_forecasting_the_monthly_inflow_of_Dez_dam_reservoir","229712978_Design_and_Implementation_of_Intelligent_Systems_With_LEGO_Mindstorms_for_Undergraduate_Computer_Engineers","224355198_JGOMAS_new_approach_to_AI_teaching","224344084_Two_Approaches_to_Generate_Intelligent_Teaching-Learning_Systems_Using_Artificial_Intelligence_Techniques","221296384_An_Overview_of_Robotic_Simulation_E-Learning","3051021_Teaching_Introductory_Artificial_Intelligence_Using_a_Simple_Agent_Framework"]}
