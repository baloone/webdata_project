{"id":"316215336_Network_Information_Hiding_and_Science_20_Can_it_be_a_Match","abstract":"Science 2.0 aims at using the information sharing and collaborative features of the Internet to offer new features to the research community. Science 2.0 has been already applied to computer sciences, especially bioinformatics. For network information hiding, a field studying the possibility of concealing a communication in networks, the application of Science 2.0 is still a rather uncovered territory. To foster the discussion of potential benefits for network information hiding, we provide a disquisition for six different Science 2.0 aspects when applied to this domain.","authors":["Steffen Wendzel","Luca Caviglione","Wojciech Mazurczyk","Jean-Francois Lalande"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Electronics and Telecommunications 63(2):217-222","Projects: Science of SecurityMy Covert Channel Research (2008-now)Information Hiding Patterns"],"references":["299404923_A_classification_of_the_use_of_research_indicators","298907983_Influence_of_international_co-authorship_on_the_research_citation_impact_of_young_universities","275055708_Information_Hiding_as_a_Challenge_for_Malware_Detection","265520228_Steganography_in_Modern_Smartphones_and_Mitigation_Techniques","263048788_Pattern-Based_Survey_and_Categorization_of_Network_Covert_Channel_Techniques","261834881_Open_Innovation_The_Next_Decade","306323478_POSTER_An_Educational_Network_Protocol_for_Covert_Channel_Analysis_Using_Patterns","273478182_Exploring_the_relationship_between_multiple_team_membership_and_team_performance_The_role_of_social_networks_and_collaborative_technology","264798361_Online_collaboration_Scientists_and_the_social_network","262277169_Towards_more_constructive_reviewing_of_SIGCOMM_papers"]}
