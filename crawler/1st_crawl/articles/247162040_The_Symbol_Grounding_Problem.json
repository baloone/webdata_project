{"id":"247162040_The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem","abstract":"How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made\nintrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our\nheads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated\nsolely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but\nother meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese\nfrom a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched:\nSymbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic\nrepresentations of two kinds: (1) \"iconic representations,\" which are analogs\nof the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2)\n\"categorical representations,\" which are learned and innate feature-detectors\nthat pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their\nsensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event\ncategories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical\nrepresentations. Higher-order (3) \"symbolic representations,\" grounded in these\nelementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership\nrelations (e.g., \"An X is a Y that is Z\").","authors":["Stevan Harnad"],"meta":["June 1990Physica D Nonlinear Phenomena 42(7):335-346","DOI:10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["246495418_Intentional_systems_in_cognitive_ethology_The_Panglossian_paradigm_defended","243652967_The_Proper_Treatment_of_Connectionism","234784524_Artificial_Intelligence_meets_natural_stupidity","38002194_Agents_Where_Artificial_Intelligence_Meets_Natural_Stupidity","334585057_A_Framework_For_Representing_Knowledge","330962357_Metaphor_and_Mental_Duality","324371655_Rules_and_Representations","324352933_The_Ecological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","318494451_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","313311834_Category_Induction_and_Representation","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","302221193_Methodological_solipsism_considered_as_a_research_strategy_in_cognitive_psychology","284229797_Methodological_solipsism_as_a_research_strategy_in_cognitive_psychology","283919346_The_Robots_Dilemma-The_Frame_Problem_in_Artificial-intelligence","275815827_The_Emperor's_New_Mind","275729274_The_Language_of_Thought","273108884_The_Language_of_Thought","272160113_Minds_Brains_and_Programs","269407900_The_Cological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","261001454_Categorical_Perception_The_Groundwork_of_Cognition","259373367_Rules_and_Representations","256600139_Philosophical_Investigations_Oxford","253779298_Book_Review_The_emperor's_new_mind","246495284_Intentional_systems_in_cognitive_ethology_The","245781029_Rules_and_representations","245770488_Connectionism_and_cognitive_science_A_critical_analysis","245619567_Categorial_perception_A_critical_overview","243762311_The_Robot''s_Dilemma_The_Frame_Problem_in_Artificial_Intelligence_Ablex","243659410_Computation_and_Cognition_Issues_in_the_Foundations_of_Cognitive_Science","238740116_Perceptrons-An_Introduction_to_Computational_Geometry","237044580_Parallel_Distributed_Processing_Explorations_in_the_Microstructure_of_Cognition","232574375_On_Finding_That_Speech_Is_Special","232518288_Mental_Images_and_Their_Transformations","232029423_How_are_grammers_represented","232003329_Methodological_Solipsism_Considered_as_a_Research_Strategy_in_Cognitive_Science","231914312_Minds_Machines_and_Godel","231888123_The_Nature_and_Plausibility_of_Cognitivism","231874855_Classical_conditioning_The_new_hegemony","231747732_Precis_of_The_Modularity_of_Mind","230876626_Parallel_Distributed_Processing_Explorations_in_the_Microstructures_of_Cognition","225070561_Some_Philosophical_Problems_from_the_Standpoint_of_Artificial_Intelligence","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","222442512_Physical_Symbol_Systems","200772734_Mental_Representations_A_Dual_Coding_Approach","50326113_Formalized_recursive_functionals_and_formalized_realizability","49302352_Computation_and_Cognition","37597181_Against_Direct_Perception","37596931_A_Framework_for_Representing_Knowledge","37532554_The_Selection_of_Behavior_The_Operant_Behaviorism_of_BF_Skinner_Comments_and_Consequences","37532536_Symbols_and_Nets_Cooperation_vs_Competition","37532524_Grounding_Symbols_in_the_Analog_World_with_Neural_Nets","37532534_Other_bodies_Other_minds_A_machine_incarnation_of_an_old_philosophical_problem","37532533_Categorical_Perception_and_the_Evolution_of_Supervised_Learning_in_Neural_Nets","37532529_Connecting_Object_to_Symbol_in_Modeling_Cognition","37532528_The_Turing_Test_Is_Not_A_Trick_Turing_Indistinguishability_Is_A_Scientific_Criterion"]}
