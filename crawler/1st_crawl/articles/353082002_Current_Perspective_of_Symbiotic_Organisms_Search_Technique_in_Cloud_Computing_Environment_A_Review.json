{"id":"353082002_Current_Perspective_of_Symbiotic_Organisms_Search_Technique_in_Cloud_Computing_Environment_A_Review","abstract":"Nature-inspired algorithms in computer science and engineering are algorithms that take their inspiration from living things and imitate their actions in order to construct functional models. The SOS algorithm (symbiotic organisms search) is a new promising metaheuristic algorithm. It is based on the symbiotic relationship that exists between different species in an ecosystem. Organisms develop symbiotic bonds like mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism to survive in their environment. Standard SOS has since been modified several times, either by hybridization or as better versions of the original algorithm. Most of these modifications came from engineering construction works and other discipline like medicine and finance. However, little improvement on the standard SOS has been noticed on its application in cloud computing environment, especially cloud task scheduling. As a result, this paper provides an overview of SOS applications in task scheduling problem and suggest a new enhanced method for better performance of the technique in terms of fast convergence speed","authors":["Zubair A.
