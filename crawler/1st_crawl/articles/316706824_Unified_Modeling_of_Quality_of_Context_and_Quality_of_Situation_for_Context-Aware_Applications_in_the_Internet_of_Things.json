{"id":"316706824_Unified_Modeling_of_Quality_of_Context_and_Quality_of_Situation_for_Context-Aware_Applications_in_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"This paper discusses the requirements of situation identification in the Internet of Things and the necessity to consider the quality of the input context data during the inference process for deriving a situation and evaluating its resulting quality. We propose to extend previous works by integrating the QoCIM meta-model within the muSIC framework dedicated to situation identification. Situation identification is derived using an ontological approach and Quality criteria are aggregated using the fuzzy Choquet operator for computing the quality of a situation. This paper shows that QoCIM allows to model quality of context (QoC) as well as quality of situation in a unified approach.","authors":["Sophie Chabridon","Amel Bouzeghoub","Anis Ahmed Nacer","Pierrick Marie"],"meta":["May 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-57837-8_30","Conference: International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling and Using Context"],"references":["303963518_Quality_of_Context_What_it_is_and_why_we_need_it","282863807_QoCIM_A_meta-model_for_quality_of_context","278790169_From_Ambient_Sensing_to_IoT-based_Context_Computing_An_Open_Framework_for_End_to_End_QoC_Management","236627583_Context_Aware_Computing_for_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","228479547_Quality_of_Context_What_It_Is_and_Why_We_Need_It","265461565_Theory_of_Capacities","222683672_A_review_of_methods_for_capacity_identification_in_Choquet_integral_based_multi-attribute_utility_theory_Applications_of_the_Kappalab_R_package","221549746_A_Situation-Based_Delivery_of_Learning_Resources_in_Pervasive_Learning","220310544_A_survey_of_context_modeling_and_reasoning_techniques","4061357_Modelling_and_using_imperfect_context_information"]}
