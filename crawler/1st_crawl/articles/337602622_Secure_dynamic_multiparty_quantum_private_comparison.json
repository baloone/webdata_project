{"id":"337602622_Secure_dynamic_multiparty_quantum_private_comparison","abstract":"We propose a feasible and efficient dynamic multiparty quantum private comparison protocol that is fully secure against participant attacks. In the proposed scheme, two almost-dishonest third parties generate two random keys and send them to all participants. Every participant independently encrypts their private information with the encryption keys and sends it to the third parties. The third parties can analyze the equality of all or some participantsâ€™ secrets without gaining access to the secret information. New participants can dynamically join the protocol without the need for any additional conditions in the protocol. We provide detailed correctness and security analysis of the proposed protocol. Our security analysis of the proposed protocol against both inside and outside attacks proves that attackers cannot extract any secret information.","authors":["Hussein Abulkasim","Ahmed Farouk","Safwat Helmy Hamad","Atefeh Atty Mashatan"],"meta":["November 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-53967-9"],"references":["330527189_Improved_Dynamic_Multi-Party_Quantum_Private_Comparison_for_Next_Generation_Mobile_Network","326581635_Rational_quantum_secret_sharing","326559274_Multi-party_traveling-mode_quantum_key_agreement_protocols_immune_to_collusive_attack","326526754_Beating_the_channel_capacity_limit_for_superdense_coding_with_entangled_ququarts","322261532_An_economic_and_feasible_Quantum_Sealed-bid_Auction_protocol","318988791_A_simple_quantum_voting_scheme_with_multi-qubit_entanglement","317829057_Multi-party_quantum_private_comparison_based_on_the_entanglement_swapping_of_d-level_cat_states_and_d-level_Bell_states","337784291_Ground-to-satellite_quantum_teleportation","322341853_Reply_to_Comment_on_'Authenticated_quantum_secret_sharing_with_quantum_dialogue_based_on_Bell_states'","318550862_Multi-user_quantum_private_comparison_with_scattered_preparation_and_one-way_convergent_transmission_of_quantum_states"]}
