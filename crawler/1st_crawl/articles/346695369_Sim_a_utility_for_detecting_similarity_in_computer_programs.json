{"id":"346695369_Sim_a_utility_for_detecting_similarity_in_computer_programs","abstract":"We describe the design and implementation of a program called sim to measure similarity between two C computer programs. It is useful for detecting plagiarism among a large set of homework programs. This software is part of a project to construct tools to assist the teaching of computer science.","authors":["David Gitchell","Nicholas Tran"],"meta":["March 1999ACM SIGCSE Bulletin 31(1):266-270","DOI:10.1145/384266.299783"],"references":["220432498_Designing_Programs_that_Check_Their_Work","243447959_Measure_of_software_similarity","234799012_Hirschberg_DS_A_Linear_space_algorithm_for_Computing_Maximal_Common_Subsequences_Commun_ACM_186_341-343","220574607_Arthur-Merlin_Games_A_Randomized_Proof_System_and_a_Hierarchy_of_Complexity_Classes","220458239_Detecting_Plagiarism_in_Student_Pascal_Programs","220422318_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Computing_Longest_Common_Subsequences","30875797_A_Theory_of_the_Learnable","19773320_Optimal_Alignments_in_Linear_Space","17749606_A_General_Method_Applicable_to_Search_for_Similarities_in_Amino_Acid_Sequence_of_2_Proteins","15934339_Identification_of_Common_Molecular_Subsequences","2281759_Parameterized_Pattern_Matching_Algorithms_and_Applications"]}
