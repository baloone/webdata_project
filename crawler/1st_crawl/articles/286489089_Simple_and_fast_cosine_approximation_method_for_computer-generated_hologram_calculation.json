{"id":"286489089_Simple_and_fast_cosine_approximation_method_for_computer-generated_hologram_calculation","abstract":"The cosine function is a heavy computational operation in computer-generated hologram (CGH) calculation; therefore, it is implemented by substitution methods such as a look-up table. However, the computational load and required memory space of such methods are still large. In this study, we propose a simple and fast cosine function approximation method for CGH calculation. As a result, we succeeded in creating CGH with sufficient quality and made the calculation time 1.6 times as fast at maximum compared to using the look-up table of the cosine function on CPU implementation.","authors":["Takashi Nishitsuji","Tomoyoshi Shimobaba","Takashi Kakue","Daisuke Arai"],"meta":["December 2015Optics Express 23(25):32465","DOI:10.1364/OE.23.032465"],"references":["260116406_ERRATUM_Image_Size_Scalable_Full-parallax_Coloured_Three-dimensional_Video_by_Electronic_Holography","318783170_Simple_wide-range_approximations_to_trigonometric_and_inverse_trigonometric_functions_useful_in_real-time_signal_processing","274730893_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_hologram_using_run-length_encoding_based_recurrence_relation","226201786_Fast_Computation_of_Fresnel_Holograms_Employing_Difference"]}
