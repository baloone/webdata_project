{"id":"225838492_Optimal_Scheduling_for_Two-Processor_Systems","abstract":"Despite the recognized potential of multiprocessing little is known concerning the general problem of finding efficient algorithms which compute minimallength schedules for given computations and m2 processors. In this paper we formulate a general model of computation structures and exhibit an efficient algorithm for finding optimal nonpreemptive schedules for these structures on two-processor systems. We prove that the algorithm gives optimal solutions and discuss its application to preemptive scheduling disciplines.","authors":["Ed Coffman","R. L.
