{"id":"223680273_Knowledge_Sharing_Behavior_in_Virtual_Communities_The_Relationship_between_Trust_Self-Efficacy_and_Outcome_Expectations","abstract":"There has been a growing interest in examining the factors that support or hinder one's knowledge sharing behavior in the virtual communities. However, still very few studies examined them from both personal and environmental perspectives. In order to explore the knowledge sharing behaviors within the virtual communities of professional societies, this study proposed a social cognitive theory (SCT)-based model that includes knowledge sharing self-efficacy and outcome expectations for personal influences, and multi-dimensional trusts for environmental influences. The proposed research model was then evaluated with structural equation modeling, and confirmatory factor analysis was also applied to test if the empirical data conform to the proposed model.","authors":["Meng-Hsiang Hsu","Teresa L.
