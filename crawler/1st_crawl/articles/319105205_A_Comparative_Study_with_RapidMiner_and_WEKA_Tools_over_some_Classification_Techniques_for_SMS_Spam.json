{"id":"319105205_A_Comparative_Study_with_RapidMiner_and_WEKA_Tools_over_some_Classification_Techniques_for_SMS_Spam","abstract":"SMS Spamming is a serious attack that can manipulate the use of the SMS by spreading the advertisement in bulk. By sending the unwanted SMS that contain advertisement can make the users feeling disturb and this against the privacy of the mobile users. To overcome these issues, many studies have proposed to detect SMS Spam by using data mining tools. This paper will do a comparative study using five machine learning techniques such as Na√Øve Bayes, K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm), Decision Tree, Random Forest and Decision Stumps to observe the accuracy result between RapidMiner and WEKA for dataset SMS Spam UCI Machine Learning repository.","authors":["Cik Feresa Mohd Foozy","Rabiah Ahmad","Mohd Faizal Abdollah","Chai Wen Chuah"],"meta":["August 2017IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 226(1):012100","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/226/1/012100","Project: SMS Spam"],"references":["332380772_A_Study_on_Analysis_of_SMS_Classification_Using_TF-IDF_Weighting","321889165_Content_based_Hybrid_SMS_Spam_Filtering_System","305919533_An_Intelligent_Classification_Model_for_Phishing_Email_Detection","304582841_A_Method_of_SMS_Spam_Filtering_Based_on_AdaBoost_Algorithm","299595310_Attitudes_and_Behaviour_of_the_Mobile_Phones_Users_towards_SMS_Advertising_A_Study_in_an_Emerging_Economy","277564480_An_Analysis_of_Various_Algorithms_For_Text_Spam_Classification_and_Clustering_Using_RapidMiner_and_Weka","312443030_SMS_Spam_Detection_using_Content-less_Features","304128075_SMS_Spam_Filtering_Using_Probabilistic_Topic_Modelling_and_Stacked_Denoising_Autoencoder","303601508_MobiPot_Understanding_Mobile_Telephony_Threats_with_Honeycards","300113154_A_New_SMS_Spam_Detection_Method_Using_Both_Content-Based_and_Non_Content-Based_Features"]}
