{"id":"329017544_Simulation_de_l'activite_humaine_Une_etude_sur_le_realisme_multi-niveau","abstract":"In this paper, we present a methodology of human activity simulation, based both on a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and statistical data. We show that the notion of simulation realism (i.e. the proximity with behaviors observed in the field) can be studied at various levels. Traditionally, these levels are never considered simultaneously in a single architecture, hence we propose a methodology allowing the combination of multi-agent simulation (aiming at a “microscopic” realism) and statistical data (aiming at a “macroscopic” realism). We present our architecture within the use of the last “time use survey”. We study the simulation's realism within both local and aggregated context.","authors":["Quentin Reynaud","Nicolas Sabouret","Yvon Haradji","François Sempé"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.3166/RIA.32.197-221"],"references":["262286680_Towards_a_truck-driver_model_using_a_hysteresis_based_analysis_and_verification_approach","258507302_HUMANS_a_HUman_Models_based_Artificial_eNvironments_software_platform","319643678_Simuler_l'activite_humaine","317185197_SMACH_Simuler_l'activite_humaine_pour_limiter_les_pics_de_consommation_electrique","314819675_Negotiation_over_tasks_in_hybrid_human-agent_teams_for_simulation-based_training","313601391_Verification_validation_and_accreditation_of_simulation_models","300253398_Behavior_Clustering_and_Explicitation_for_the_Study_of_Agents'_Credibility_Application_to_a_Virtual_Driver_Simulation","280853084_Pratique_De_La_Simulation_Numerique","278618237_Preoccupations_et_agencements_dans_les_contextes_d'activite_domestique_Contribution_a_la_conception_de_situations_informatiques_diffuses_appropriables_et_energetiquement_efficaces","261343640_Collaborative_virtual_environment_to_study_aircraft_evacuation_for_training_and_education","258507301_Using_Planning_to_Predict_and_Influence_Autonomous_Agents_Behaviour_in_a_Virtual_Environment_for_Training","245145476_Methodology_for_peak_energy_requirement_considering_actual_variation_of_occupants'_behavior_schedules","237837519_GAMA_Multi-level_and_complex_environment_for_agent-based_models_and_simulations","254078590_Reconceptualizing_Organizational_Routines_As_a_Source_of_Flexibility_and_Change","246794071_Measuring_How_People_Spend_Their_Time_A_Time-Use_Survey_Design"]}
