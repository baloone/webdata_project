{"id":"319852828_Edge_odd_graceful_labeling_of_some_path_and_cycle_related_graphs","abstract":"Solairaju and Chithra introduced a new type of labeling of a graph G with p vertices and q edges called an edge odd graceful labeling if there is a bijection f from the edges of the graph to the set {1,3,…,2q−1} such that, when each vertex is assigned the sum of all edges incident to it mod2k, where k=max(p,q), the resulting vertex labels are distinct. In this paper we proved necessary and sufficient conditions for some path and cycle related graphs to be edge odd graceful such as: Friendship graphs, Wheel graph, Helm graph, Web graph, Double wheel graph, Gear graph, Fan graph, Double fan graph and Polar grid graph.","authors":["S.N.
