Microblogging sites have millions of people sharing their thoughts daily because of its characteristic short and simple manner of expression. We propose and investigate a paradigm to mine the sentiment from a popular real-time microblogging service, Twitter, where users post real time reactions to and opinions about “everything”. In this paper, we expound a hybrid approach using both corpus based and dictionary based methods to determine the semantic orientation of the opinion words in tweets. A case study is presented to illustrate the use and effectiveness of the proposed system","authors":["Akshi Kumar","Teeja Mary Sebastian"],"meta":["July 2012International Journal of Computer Science Issues 9(3):372-378"],"references":["266011079_Sentiment_Analysis_A_Perspective_on_its_Past_Present_and_Future","247935218_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Twitter_Data","221612814_Sentiment_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Twitter_Streaming_Data","220746311_Twitter_as_a_Corpus_for_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","288923079_Entity_based_sentiment_analysis_on_twitter","268369281_Machine_Learning_assisted_Sentiment_Analysis","242660794_Sentiment_Analysis_of_User-Generated_Twitter_Updates_using_Various_Classication_Techniques","228523135_Twitter_sentiment_classification_using_distant_supervision","221215498_Collaboration_vs_Participation_The_Role_of_Virtual_Communities_in_a_Web_20_World","221101683_Robust_Sentiment_Detection_on_Twitter_from_Biased_and_Noisy_Data"]}
