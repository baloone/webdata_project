{"id":"318697393_Certified_detection_of_parallel_robot_assembly_mode_under_Type_2_singularity_crossing_trajectories","abstract":"Increasing the size of operationnal workspace is one of the main problems parallel robots are faced with. Among all the proposed solutions to that, crossing Type 2 singularities using dedicated trajectory generation and multi-model controller has a great potential. Yet, this approach is not sufficient for the robot to operate autonomously, as assembly mode detection during the motion currently requires additional redundant information. To tackle this problem, we propose an algorithm based on Interval Analysis (IA) that is able to track the end-effector of the robot even under assembly mode change.\nIA-based solvers for the forward kinematic problem of parallel robots are well known, but they cannot be used under assembly mode change. Compared to those classical approaches, the major modification introduced is the tracking of end-effector velocity in addition to its pose. Using this new information of velocity, the algorithm is capable to monitor the assembly mode change of the robot happening when the singularities are crossed. The behavior and the reliability of this algorithm are analyzed experimentally on a five-bar planar parallel mechanism .","authors":["Adrien Koessler","Alexandre Goldsztejn","SÃ©bastien Briot","Nicolas Bouton"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989720","Conference: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","Project: Singularity crossing of parallel robot"],"references":["301337911_Global_Optimization_Based_on_Contractor_Programming_An_Overview_of_the_IBEX_Library","272483501_Design_of_a_Controller_for_Enlarging_Parallel_Robots_Workspace_through_Type_2_Singularity_Crossing","265482652_An_Interval-Based_Method_for_Workspace_Analysis_of_Planar_Flexure-Jointed_Mechanism","258859010_Solving_the_forward_kinematics_of_Gough-type_parallel_manipulator_with_interval_analysis","305830107_A_Three-Step_Methodology_for_Dimensional_Tolerance_Synthesis_of_Parallel_Manipulators","304492861_A_switching_inverse_dynamics_controller_for_parallel_manipulators_around_drive_singular_configurations","273057265_Enlarging_Parallel_Robot_Workspace_through_Type-2_Singularity_Crossing","271419351_A_survey_of_applications_of_interval_analysis_to_robust_control","261416072_Interval_analysis_for_robot_precision_evaluation","258819766_Comparison_of_the_efficiency_of_five_observability_indices_for_robot_calibration"]}
