{"id":"271767758_Business_process_simulation_Transformation_of_BPMN_20_to_DEVS_models_WIP","abstract":"Industrial enterprises have gradually moved their goals towards production of physical products supplemented by intangible services to differentiate themselves in a compatible market. The study of these services, their set up, and the evaluation of their efficiency is a rising research domain. In the frame of Model Driven Service Engineering Architecture (MDSEA), a service system is modeled from different point of views (static and dynamic) at the different MDSEA levels: Business Service Model (BSM), Technology Independent Model (TIM), and Technology Specific Model (TSM). Simulation is a dynamic feature of MDSE and which explains the need of coherent M&S formalisms for simulation activities. Accordingly, this paper presents the simulation of service systems based on DEVS models. It defines a transformation approach of BPMN models into DEVS simulation models based on the metamodel approach, and describes the enrichment of obtained DEVS models through performance indicators (time and costs).","authors":["Hassan Bazoun","Youssef Bouanan","Gregory Zacharewicz","Yves Ducq"],"meta":["April 2014","Conference: Proceedings of the Symposium on Theory of Modeling & Simulation - DEVS IntegrativeAt: Tampa, Florida","Project: Model Driven Approaches for Enterprise Interoperability"],"references":["275038907_SLMToolBox_An_implementation_of_MDSEA_for_Servitisation_and_Enterprise_Interoperability","220164712_G-DEVSHLA_environment_for_distributed_simulations_of_workflows","290611257_A_meta-model_for_DEVS_Designed_following_Model_Driven_Engineering_specifications","262327717_Model_transformation_from_BPMN_to_DEVS_in_the_MDD4MS_framework"]}
