{"id":"264585537_Natural_Language_Processing","abstract":"Researchers in natural language processing (NLP) apply computational techniques to the understanding and generation of human language. Currently, we are focusing on the development of grammatical formalisms and parsing algorithms, appropriate semantic representations for word and sentence meaning, and ways of specifying more elusive meanings that depend on knowledge of the context of utterance. Applications of natural language research include interfaces to expert systems and database query systems, machine translation, text generation, story understanding, and computer-aided instruction. In this paper, we introduce NLP research in general and describe three NLP projects under way at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey.","authors":["Julia Hirschberg","Bruce W.
