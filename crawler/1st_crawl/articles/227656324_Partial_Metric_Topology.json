{"id":"227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology","abstract":"Metric spaces are inevitably Hausdorff and so cannot, for example, be used to study non-Hausdorff topologies such as those required in the Tarskian approach to programming language semantics. This paper presents a symmetric generalised metric for such topologies, an approach which sheds new light on how metric tools such as Banach's Theorem can be extended to non-Hausdorff topologies.","authors":["S.
