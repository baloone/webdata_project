{"id":"309099746_Specific_features_of_NDVI_NDWI_and_MNDWI_as_reflected_in_land_cover_categories","abstract":"The remote sensing techniques provide a great possibility to analyze the environmental processes in\nlocal or global scale. Landsat images with their 30 m resolution are suitable among others for land\ncover mapping and change monitoring. In this study three spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, MNDWI) were\ninvestigated from the aspect of land cover types: water body (W); plough land (PL); forest (F); vineyard\n(V); grassland (GL) and built-up areas (BU) using Landsat-7 ETM+ data. The range, the dissimilarities\nand the correlation of spectral indices were examined. In BU – GL – F categories similar NDVI values\nwere calculated, but the other land cover types differed significantly. The water related indices (NDWI,\nMNDWI) were more effective (especially the MNDWI) to enhance water features, but the values of other\ncategories ranged from narrower interval. Weak correlation were found among the indices due to the\ndifferences caused by the water land cover class. Statistically, most land cover types differed from each\nother, but in several cases similarities can be found when delineating vegetation with various water\ncontent. MNDWI was found as the most effective in highlighting water bodies.","authors":["Szilard Szabo","Zoltán Gácsi","Boglarka Bertalan-Balazs"],"meta":["October 2016Landscape & Environment 10(3-4):194-202","DOI:10.21120/LE/10/3-4/13"],"references":["308364773_An_interactive_tool_for_semi-automatic_feature_extraction_of_hyperspectral_data","308022770_Subpixel_Vegetation_Classification_of_EO-1_Hyperion_Data_Through_Spectral_Reduction_A_Case_Study_in_Hungary","304715764_Spatial_assessment_of_land_surface_temperature_and_land_useland_cover_in_Langkawi_Island","272684189_Classification_of_Herbaceous_Vegetation_Using_Airborne_Hyperspectral_Imagery","265401227_Examination_of_sedimentary_deposition_in_the_active_floodplains_of_bereg-plain","304022999_Identification_of_extent_topographic_characteristics_and_land_abandonment_process_of_vineyard_terraces_in_the_Tokaj-Hegyalja_wine_region_between_1784_and_2010","301729408_Evaluating_the_accuracy_of_orthophotos_and_satellite_images_in_the_context_of_road_centerlines_in_test_sites_in_hungary","284418225_A_study_on_information_extraction_of_water_body_with_the_modified_normalized_difference_water_index_MNDWI","281345608_Ggplot2_Elegant_Graphics_for_Data_Analysis","278742329_Multi-indicator_sensitivity_analysis_of_climate_change_effects_on_landscapes_in_the_Kiskunsag_National_Park_Hungary"]}
