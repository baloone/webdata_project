{"id":"331020801_Compressed_Sensing_MRI_Reconstruction_with_Multiple_Sparsity_Constraints_on_Radial_Sampling","abstract":"Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI) is a promising technique for accelerating MRI acquisitions by using fewer k-space data. Exploiting more sparsity is an important approach to improving the CS-MRI reconstruction quality. We propose a novel CS-MRI framework based on multiple sparse priors to increase reconstruction accuracy. The wavelet sparsity, wavelet tree structured sparsity, and nonlocal total variation (NLTV) regularizations were integrated in the CS-MRI framework, and the optimization problem was solved using a fast composite splitting algorithm (FCSA). The proposed method was evaluated on different types of MR images with different radial sampling schemes and different sampling ratios and compared with the state-of-the-art CS-MRI reconstruction methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), feature similarity (FSIM), relative l2 norm error (RLNE), and mean structural similarity (MSSIM). The results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the traditional CS-MRI algorithms in both visual and quantitative comparisons.","authors":["Jianping Huang","Lihui Wang","Yuemin Zhu"],"meta":["February 2019Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2019:1-14","DOI:10.1155/2019/3694604"],"references":["327695829_Median_Filter_Based_Compressed_Sensing_Model_with_Application_to_MR_Image_Reconstruction","325412374_Compressed_Sensing_ECG_using_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines","323825340_Compressed-Sensing_MRI_Based_on_Adaptive_Tight_Frame_in_Gradient_Domain","308625926_Combined_Similarity_to_Reference_Image_with_Joint_Sparsifying_Transform_for_Longitudinal_Compressive_Sensing_MRI","325583855_An_autoencoder_based_formulation_for_compressed_sensing_reconstruction","319599600_Compressed_Sensing_MRI_With_Phase_Noise_Disturbance_Based_on_Adaptive_Tight_Frame_and_Total_Variation","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","309828230_Speed_in_Clinical_Magnetic_Resonance","299385636_Sparse_Reconstruction_Techniques_in_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","287213369_Evaluation_of_Variable_Density_and_Data-Driven_K-Space_Undersampling_for_Compressed_Sensing_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging"]}
