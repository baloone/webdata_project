{"id":"262937234_Sharp_asymptotics_for_the_quasi-stationary_distribution_of_birth-and-death_processes","abstract":"We study a general class of birth-and-death processes with state space\n$\\mathbb{N}$ that describes the size of a population going to extinction with\nprobability one. This class contains the logistic case. The scale of the\npopulation is measured in terms of a `carrying capacity' $K$. When $K$ is\nlarge, the process is expected to stay close to its deterministic equilibrium\nduring a long time but ultimately goes extinct. Our aim is to quantify the\nbehavior of the process and the mean time to extinction in the quasi-stationary\ndistribution as a function of $K$, for large $K$. We also give a quantitative\ndescription of this quasi-stationary distribution. It turns out to be close to\na Gaussian distribution centered about the deterministic long-time equilibrium,\nwhen $K$ is large. Our analysis relies on precise estimates of the maximal\neigenvalue, of the corresponding eigenvector and of the spectral gap of a\nself-adjoint operator associated with the semigroup of the process.","authors":["Jean-René Chazottes","P.
