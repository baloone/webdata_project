{"id":"327736507_On_the_Performance_and_Security_of_Multiplication_in_GF2N","abstract":"Multiplications in G F ( 2 N ) can be securely optimized for cryptographic applications when the integer N is small and does not match machine words (i.e., N < 32 ). In this paper, we present a set of optimizations applied to DAGS, a code-based post-quantum cryptographic algorithm and one of the submissions to the National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€™s (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization call.","authors":["Jean-Luc Danger","Youssef El Housni","Adrien Facon","Cheikh Thiecoumba Gueye"],"meta":["September 2018Cryptography 2(3):25","DOI:10.3390/cryptography2030025"],"references":["328377369_Detecting_Cache-Timing_Vulnerabilities_in_Post-Quantum_Cryptography_Algorithms","314701726_Cryptanalysis_of_the_McEliece_Public_Key_Cryptosystem_Based_on_Polar_Codes","267452173_Compact_McEliece_keys_based_on_quasi-dyadic_Srivastava_codes","221348198_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_McEliece_Variants_with_Compact_Keys_2009_Secret_19","279868737_FLUSHRELOAD_A_High_Resolution_Low_Noise_L3_Cache_Side-Channel_Attack","244459799_Efficient_VLSI_Architectures_for_Bit_Parallel_Computation_in_Galois_Fields","221291657_On_the_Power_of_Bitslice_Implementation_on_Intel_Core2_Processor","221208234_Predicting_Secret_Keys_Via_Branch_Prediction","220479107_Efficient_Cache_Attacks_on_AES_and_Countermeasures","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems"]}
