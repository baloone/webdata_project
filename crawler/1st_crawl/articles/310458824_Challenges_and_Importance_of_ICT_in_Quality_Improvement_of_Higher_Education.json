{"id":"310458824_Challenges_and_Importance_of_ICT_in_Quality_Improvement_of_Higher_Education","abstract":"Computer science is a very young and a rapidly developing discipline. Now the computer science discipline has completed near about 65 years. It's been an exciting and dynamic time and the contributions that our field has made to society and other disciplines have been profound. As the field has matured, there is a growing sense of diminished possibilities and this is understandable. At present the advances in mature areas may be harder to come but their absolute impact on society can be huge. This is a golden age for our field and in many important ways; the potential for research is unprecedented [1]. But there is still lack of identity in computer science as a discipline. In this paper we have shown challenges and importance of Information and Communication Technology in Quality improvement of Higher Education. We have proposed the necessary suggestions that need to be carried out to reduce the challenges of ICT and also for improving the quality of education in higher studies.","authors":["Deepak Kumar Verma","Mazhar Khaliq","Santosh Kumar"],"meta":["October 2016"],"references":["234825132_Computer_science_teacher_preparation_is_critical","220142048_A_vision_for_computer_science_-_The_system_perspective","2956227_A_New_Framework_for_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","311468966_Computing_the_profession","221536696_Computing_the_Profession","220478735_Computing_as_a_discipline","220426836_Great_Principles_of_Computing","2607785_Computer_Science_The_Discipline"]}
