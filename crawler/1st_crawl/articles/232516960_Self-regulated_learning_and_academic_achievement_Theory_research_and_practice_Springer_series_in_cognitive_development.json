Our goal in organizing the book was to provide a forum in which comprehensive descriptions of self-regulated learning theories could be presented along with supporting evidence. \n\nThis goal led to several decisions that shaped the book's form. First, we wanted an integrated series of chapters that would survey the field rather than a collection of disparate descriptions of individual programs of research. . . . The use of a common format gave cohesiveness to the book, making it appropriate as a text for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in such fields as education, psychology, public health, and behavioral medicine. Second, we wanted each to focus not only on theory and research in self-regulated learning but also on instructional practice. Authors were asked to give specific examples of how teachers or parents might apply their proposed procedures to youngsters with self-regulation deficiencies. Third, we wanted the text to be of value to a broad spectrum of readers. The contributors represent a diversity of theoretical traditionsâ€”operant, phenomenological, social cognitive (learning), volitional, Vygotskian, and constructivist. By presenting such a range of viewpoints, the common features of self-regulated learning approaches emerged clearly and distinctively.
