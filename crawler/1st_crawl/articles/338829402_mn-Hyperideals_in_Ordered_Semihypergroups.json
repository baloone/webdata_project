{"id":"338829402_mn-Hyperideals_in_Ordered_Semihypergroups","abstract":"In this paper, first we introduce the notions of an (m, n)-hyperideal and a generalized (m, n)-hyperideal in an ordered semihypergroup, and then, some properties of these hyperideals are studied. Thereafter, we characterize (m, n)-regularity, (m, 0)-regularity, and (0, n)-regularity of an ordered semihypergroup in terms of its (m, n)-hyperideals, (m, 0)-hyperideals and (0, n)-hyperideals, respectively. The relations mI , In, H n m , and B n m on an ordered semihypergroup are, then, introduced. We prove that B n m âŠ† H n m on an ordered semihypergroup and provide a condition under which equality holds in the above inclusion. We also show that the (m, 0)-regularity [(0, n)-regularity] of an element induce the (m, 0)-regularity [(0, n)-regularity] of the whole H n m-class containing that element as well as the fact that (m, n)-regularity and (m, n)-right weakly regularity of an element induce the (m, n)-regularity and (m, n)-right weakly regularity of the whole B n m-class and H n m-class containing that element, respectively.","authors":["Ahsan Mahboob","Noor Mohammad Khan","Bijan Davvaz"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.29252/cgasa.12.1.43"],"references":["314251296_An_investigation_on_hyper_S-posets_over_ordered_semihypergroups","308795031_A_Short_Note_on_The_Relation_in_Ordered_Semihypergroups","268249364_Ideals_in_a_semihypergroup_and_Green's_relations","331558737_Structural_properties_for_mn-quasi-hyperideals_in_ordered_semihypergroups","305543946_An_investigation_on_fuzzy_hyperideals_of_ordered_semihypergroups","302415052_Bi-hyperideals_and_quasi-hyperideals_in_ordered_semihypergroups","287290450_Properties_of_hyperideals_in_ordered_semihypergroups","281197966_Characterizations_of_fuzzy_bi-hyperideals_in_ordered_semihypergroups","268764679_Notes_on_mn-ideals_III","265439718_Generalized_ideals_in_semigroups"]}
