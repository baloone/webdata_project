The following tests were applied to all subjects: The Wechsler memory scale-revised, a clock-drawing, the dual similarities, interpretation of proverbs, word fluency, the Stroop, the Boston naming (BNT), the Benton face recognition, a copying-drawings and ?ktem verbal memory processes (?-VMPT) tests. A multilayer perceptron, a support vector machine and a classification via regression with M5-model trees were employed for classification.\n\nResults: \nThe pairwise classification results show that ARCD is completely separable from AD with a success rate of 100% and highly separable from MCI and VD with success rates of 95.4% and 86.30%, respectively. The neurocognitive tests with the higher merit values were ?-VMPT recognition (ARCD vs. AD), ?-VMPT total learning (ARCD vs. MCI) and semantic fluency, proverbs, Stroop interference and naming BNT (ARCD vs. VD).\n\nConclusion: \nThe findings show that machine learning can be successfully utilized for distinguishing ARCD from dementias based on neurocognitive tests.","authors":["Füsun Er","Pınar Iscen","Sevki Sahin","Nilgun Cinar"],"meta":["March 2017Journal of Clinical Neuroscience 42","DOI:10.1016/j.jocn.2017.03.021","Projects: COVID-19 and NEUROLOGYClinical NeurophysiologyAlzheimer's Disease"],"references":["276412348_Evaluation_From_precision_recall_and_F-measure_to_ROC_informedness_markedness_correlation","288259939_A_verbal_test_of_memory_processes_A_preliminary_study","277679460_Vascular_dementia_Diagnostic_criteria_for_research_studies_Report_of_the_NINDS-AIREN_International_Workshop","260010345_Latent_Information_in_Fluency_Lists_Predicts_Functional_Decline_in_Persons_at_Risk_for_Alzheimer_Disease","251234116_Machine_learning_approaches_to_diagnosis_and_laterality_effects_in_semantic_dementia_discourse","243766442_Errata_Use_of_Ranks_in_One-Criterion_Variance_Analysis","234698657_Automated_classification_of_primary_progressive_aphasia_subtypes_from_narrative_speech_transcripts","233974125_Comparative_accuracies_of_two_common_screening_instruments_for_classification_of_Alzheimer's_disease_mild_cognitive_impairment_and_healthy_aging","231872787_Aging-Associated_Cognitive_Decline","227836704_Clock-drawing_Is_it_the_ideal_cognitive_screening_test","224967569_Comparison_of_Four_Verbal_Memory_Tests_for_the_Diagnosis_and_Predictive_Value_of_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment","215990408_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","51071320_Albert_MS_DeKosky_ST_Dickson_D_Dubois_B_Feldman_HH_Fox_NC_Gamst_A_Holtzman_DM_Jagust_WJ_Petersen_RC_Snyder_PJ_Carrillo_MC_Thies_B_Phelps_CHThe_diagnosis_of_mild_cognitive_impairment_due_to_Alzheimer's","51530230_EEG_correlates_of_fatigue_during_administration_of_a_neuropsychological_test_battery","51071321_The_diagnosis_of_dementia_due_to_Alzheimer's_disease_Recommendations_from_the_National_Institute_on_Aging-Alzheimer's_Association_workgroups_on_diagnostic_guidelines_for_Alzheimer's_disease"]}
