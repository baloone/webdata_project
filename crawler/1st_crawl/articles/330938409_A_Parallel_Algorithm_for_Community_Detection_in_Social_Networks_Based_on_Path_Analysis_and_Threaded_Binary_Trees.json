{"id":"330938409_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Community_Detection_in_Social_Networks_Based_on_Path_Analysis_and_Threaded_Binary_Trees","abstract":"Several synchronous applications are based on graph-structured data. A very important application of this kind is community detection. Since the number and size of the networks modeled by graphs grow larger and larger, some level of parallelism needs to be used, to reduce the computational costs of such massive applications. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (referred as lists on Facebook and Twitter), while users, based on their interests place themselves into groups of interest. However, community detection and is a very effortful procedure and, in addition, these communities need to be updated very often, resulting in more effort. In this work, we combine parallel processing techniques with a typical data structure like threaded binary trees to detect communities in an efficient manner. Our strategy is implemented over weighted networks with irregular topologies and it is based on a stepwise path detection strategy, where each step finds a link that increases the overall strength of the path being detected. To verify the functionality and parallelism benefits of our scheme, we perform experiments on five real-world data sets: Facebook R , Twitter R , Google+ R , Pokec, and LiveJournal.","authors":["Stavros Souravlas","Angelo Sifaleras","Stefanos Katsavounis"],"meta":["February 2019IEEE Access 7(1):20499-20519","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2897783"],"references":["328846951_A_Novel_Interdisciplinary_Approach_for_Community_Detection_Based_on_Remote_File_Requests","322348148_Efficient_Community-Based_Data_Distribution_Over_Multicast_Trees","320120582_On_the_Detection_of_Overlapped_Network_Communities_via_Weight_Redistributions","317972435_Ascent-descent_variable_neighborhood_decomposition_search_for_community_detection_by_modularity_maximization","323001077_A_Fast_Parallel_Community_Discovery_Model_on_Complex_Networks_Through_Approximate_Optimization","320640572_Community_Detection_Algorithm_for_Big_Social_Networks_Using_Hybrid_Architecture","319454159_A_Fast_Overlapping_Community_Detection_Algorithm_Based_on_Weak_Cliques_for_Large-Scale_Networks","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","309381129_Efficient_Modularity_Density_Heuristics_for_Large_Graphs","303097154_Overlapping_Community_Detection_Based_on_Node_Location_Analysis"]}
