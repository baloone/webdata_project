{"id":"324699224_A_model_for_aligning_assessment_with_competences_and_learning_activities_in_online_courses","abstract":"This article presents a model for designing e-assessment processes aligned with competences and learning activities. The authors examined assessment in student-centered, competence-based learning in online contexts. We analyzed the importance of alignment for properly selecting the learning activities that best guide students towards the desired level of competence acquisition (i.e. learning outcomes). We explored the leading types of assessment and new opportunities for assessment derived from the use of technologies. The model developed takes advantage of the potential for technologies to go beyond traditional assessment approaches and proposes a classification of e-assessment activities organized by competences. When the model was applied in a real online course, results suggested it can help teachers and students better understand the meaning of competence-based learning and how the formative assessment approach is useful for helping students attain the desired competence levels.","authors":["Ana-Elena Guerrero","Ingrid Noguera"],"meta":["April 2018The Internet and Higher Education
