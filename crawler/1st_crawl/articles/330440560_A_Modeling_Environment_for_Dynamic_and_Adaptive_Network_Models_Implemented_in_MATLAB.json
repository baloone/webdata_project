{"id":"330440560_A_Modeling_Environment_for_Dynamic_and_Adaptive_Network_Models_Implemented_in_MATLAB","abstract":"In this paper a software environment to support Network-Oriented Modeling is presented. The environment has been implemented in Matlab. This code covers the principles of modeling by temporal-causal networks. The software environment has built-in options for network adaptation principles such as the Hebbian Learning principle from Neuroscience and the adaptation principle for bonding based on homophily from Social Science. The implementation is illustrated for an adaptive temporal-causal network model for decision making under acute stress.","authors":["Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari","Jan Treur"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-981-15-0637-6_8","Conference: Proceedings of the 4th International Congress on Information and Communication Technology (ICICT2019), vol. 1, 25-26 Feb, Springer, 2019.At: London, UK.Volume: Yang XS., Sherratt S., Dey N., Joshi A.
