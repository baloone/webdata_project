{"id":"51952343_On_protected_nodes_in_Digital_Search_Trees","abstract":"Recently, 2-protected nodes were studied in the context of ordered trees and\n$k$-trees. These nodes have a distance of at least 2 to each leaf. Here, we\nstudy digital search trees, which are binary trees, but with a different\nprobability distribution underlying. Our result says, that \\emph{grosso modo}\nsome 31% of the nodes are 2-protected. Methods include exponential generating\nfunctions, contour integration, and some elements from $q$-analysis.","authors":["Rosena R. X.
