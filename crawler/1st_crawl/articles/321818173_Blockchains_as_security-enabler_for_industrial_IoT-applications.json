{"id":"321818173_Blockchains_as_security-enabler_for_industrial_IoT-applications","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThis paper aims to describe a method for Internet-of-Things-devices to achieve industrial grade reliability for information transfer from wireless sensor systems to production systems using blockchain technologies.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nAn increased security and reliability of submitted data within the sensor network could be achieved on an application level. Therefore, a lightweight, high-level communication protocol based on blockchain principles was designed.\n\nFindings\n\nBlockchain mechanisms can secure the wireless communication of Internet-of-Things-devices in a lightweight and scalable manner.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThe innovation of this research is the successful application of general blockchain mechanisms to increase security of a wireless sensor system without binding to a dedicated blockchain technology.","authors":["Volker Skwarek"],"meta":["December 2017Asia Pacific Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship 11(3):301-311","DOI:10.1108/APJIE-12-2017-035"],"references":["261958666_Fundamentals_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Theory_and_Practice","319909399_Sensornetze_und_Schwarmintelligenz_in_industriellen_Anwendungen_Industrie_40_Internet_of_Things_IoT_Machine-to-Machine_Big_Data_Augmented_Reality_Technologie","317927402_IoT_Goes_Nuclear_Creating_a_ZigBee_Chain_Reaction","309582200_Niedrigstenergie-Ortungsverfahren_nach_dem_Prinzip_der_Schwarmintelligenz","255615294_Practical_Byzantine_Fault_Tolerance_Ein_Algorithmus_von_Miguel_Castro","228640975_Bitcoin_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System","2554993_The_Byzantine_Generals_Problem"]}
