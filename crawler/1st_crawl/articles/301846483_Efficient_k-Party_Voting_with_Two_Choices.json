{"id":"301846483_Efficient_k-Party_Voting_with_Two_Choices","abstract":"We consider the problem of distributed $k$-party voting with two choices as well as a simple modification of this protocol in complete graphs. In the standard version, we are given a graph in which every node possesses one of $k$ different opinions at the beginning. In each step, every node chooses two neighbors uniformly at random. If the opinions of the two neighbors coincide, then this opinion is adopted. It is known that if $k=2$ and the difference between the two opinions is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$, then after $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ steps, every node will possess the largest initial opinion, with high probability. We show that if $k =\\mathcal{O}(n^\\epsilon)$ for some small $\\epsilon$, then this protocol converges to the initial majority within $\\mathcal{O}(k+\\log{n})$ steps, with high probability, as long as the initial difference between the largest and second largest opinion is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$. Furthermore, there exist initial configurations where the $\\Theta(k)$ bound on the run time is matched. If the initial difference is $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$, then the largest opinion may loose the vote with constant probability. To speed up our process, we consider the following variant of the two-choices protocol. The process is divided into several phases, and in the first step of a phase every node applies the two choices protocol. If a new opinion is adopted, the node remembers it by setting a certain bit to true. In the subsequent steps of that phase, each node samples one neighbor, and if the bit of this neighbor is set to true, then the node takes the opinion of this neighbor and sets its bit to true as well. At the end of the phase, the bits are reset to false. Then, the phases are repeated several times. We show that this modified protocol improves significantly over the standard two-choices protocol.","authors":["Robert Els√§sser","Tom Friedetzky","Dominik Kaaser","Frederik Mallmann-Trenn"],"meta":["February 2016"],"references":["310737137_Simple_dynamics_for_plurality_consensus","304821918_Determining_majority_in_networks_with_local_interactions_and_very_small_local_memory","282863695_Fast_Consensus_for_Voting_on_General_Expander_Graphs","262029666_Determining_Majority_in_Networks_with_Local_Interactions_and_Very_Small_Local_Memory","258631568_Probabilistic_consensus_via_polling_and_majority_rules","257592468_Simple_Dynamics_for_Majority_Consensus","236202775_Timing_in_chemical_reaction_networks","230851043_The_Cell_Cycle_Switch_Computes_Approximate_Majority","224285477_Coalescing_Random_Walks_and_Voting_on_Connected_Graphs","224224604_Community_detection_via_semi-synchronous_label_propagation_algorithms","220533549_Multiple_Random_Walks_in_Random_Regular_Graphs","38384972_Voter_Model_and_Biased_Voter_Model_in_Heterogeneous_Environments","5915527_Near_Linear_Time_Algorithm_to_Detect_Community_Structures_in_Large-Scale_Networks","3880868_Randomized_rumor_spreading","324932789_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_its_Applications","313571219_Weighted_voting_for_replicated_dataA","312737930_Immunity_against_Local_Influence","305973807_Voter_Model_and_Biased_Voter_Model_in_Heterogeneous_Environments","301854638_Plurality_Consensus_via_Shuffling_Lessons_Learned_from_Load_Balancing","300175420_Fast_and_Exact_Majority_in_Population_Protocols","299861081_Minority_Becomes_Majority_in_Social_Networks","299685658_Convergence_in_Social_Influence_Networks","282333383_Local_Information_in_Influence_Networks","281312251_Stabilizing_Consensus_with_Many_Opinions","279393609_Neural_and_Automata_Networks","275619177_An_Introduction_To_Probability_Theory_And_Its_Applications","270007010_Global_majority_consensus_by_local_majority_polling_on_graphs_of_a_given_degree_sequence","267987625_Stabilizing_Consensus_With_the_Power_of_Two_Choices","266240257_Convergence_Speed_of_Binary_Interval_Consensus","263856092_Plurality_Consensus_in_the_Gossip_Model","261988788_The_Power_of_Two_Choices_in_Distributed_Voting","259804285_Opinion_Exchange_Dynamics","250319904_An_Introduction_to_Population_Protocols","247406985_Reversible_Markov_Chains_and_Random_Walks_on_Graphs","240053444_Interacting_Particle_Systems","239667611_On_the_Complexity_of_Cooperative_Solution_Concepts","232244301_On_the_Analysis_of_a_Label_Propagation_Algorithm_for_Community_Detection","231974508_Finite_particle_systems_and_infection_models","225685483_A_simple_population_protocol_for_fast_robust_approximate_majority","224500487_Using_Three_States_for_Binary_Consensus_on_Complete_Graphs","224136964_Convergence_Speed_of_Binary_Interval_Consensus","222667658_Dynamic_Monopolies_of_Constant_Size","222134019_Local_majorities_coalitions_and_monopolies_in_graphs_A_review","221426740_Probabilistic_Local_Majority_Voting_for_the_Agreement_Problem_on_Finite_Graphs","221346686_Fair_Leader_Election_by_Randomized_Voting","221233831_Brief_Announcement_Stabilizing_Consensus_with_the_Power_of_Two_Choices","220247152_Distributed_Probabilistic_Polling_and_Applications_to_Proportionate_Agreement","38362464_Ergodic_Theorems_for_Weakly_Interacting_Infinite_Systems_and_the_Voter_Model","4038189_Gossip-based_computation_of_aggregate_information","2559570_Weighted_Voting_for_Replicated_Data","1959804_The_Computational_Power_of_Population_Protocols"]}
