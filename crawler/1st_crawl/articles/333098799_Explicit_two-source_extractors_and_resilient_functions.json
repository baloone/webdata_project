{"id":"333098799_Explicit_two-source_extractors_and_resilient_functions","abstract":"We explicitly construct an extractor for two independent sources on n bits, each with min-entropy at least logC n for a large enough constant C. Our extractor outputs one bit and has error n-Ω(1). The best previous extractor, by Bourgain, required each source to have min-entropy .499n. A key ingredient in our construction is an explicit construction of a monotone, almost-balanced Boolean function on n bits that is resilient to coalitions of size n1–δ for any δ > 0. In fact, our construction is stronger in that it gives an explicit extractor for a generalization of non-oblivious bit-fixing sources on n bits, where some unknown n – q bits are chosen almost polylog(n)-wise independently, and the remaining q = n1–δ bits are chosen by an adversary as an arbitrary function of the n – q bits. The best previous construction, by Viola, achieved q = n1/2–δ. Our explicit two-source extractor directly implies an explicit construction of a 2(log log N)O(1)-Ramsey graph over N vertices, improving bounds obtained by Barak et al. and matching an independent work by Cohen.","authors":["Chattopadhyay","Zuckerman"],"meta":["May 2019Annals of Mathematics 189(3):653","DOI:10.4007/annals.2019.189.3.1"],"references":[]}
