{"id":"287766276_Corpus_approaches_to_evaluation_Phraseology_and_evaluative_language","abstract":"This book applies a set of corpus investigation techniques to the study of evaluation, or stance, or affect, in naturally-occurring discourse. Evaluative language indicates opinions, attitudes, and judgments. It is an important part of activities such as persuading someone that a particular viewpoint is correct, or in constructing knowledge from a different number of theories. This book argues that phraseology-regularities or patterns in language identifiable from corpus studies-is important to the study of evaluative language. It makes a number of more specific arguments: that modal meaning is expressed through particular phrases and not only through modal verbs; that figurative phrases are used to intensify evaluation; and that patterns of use may be exploited to achieve an automatic identification of evaluations. It also builds on the authorâ€™s previous work in exploring how films and journalism use language and images to build knowledge from ideas.","authors":["Susan Hunston"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.4324/9780203841686"],"references":["286812048_1_Phraseology_and_linguistic_theory_A_brief_survey","249251740_On_EFL_Teachers_awareness_and_agency","249237185_Verbs_Observed_A_Corpus-driven_Pedagogic_Grammar1","233639914_Lexis_word_form_and_complementation_pattern_A_corpus_study","233599353_The_evaluation_of_status_in_multi-modal_texts","42791754_The_role_of_APPRAISAL_and_corpora_in_detecting_covert_evaluation","292444739_Verbal_and_mental_processes_in_academic_disciplines","288967781_Definitions_and_explanations","285042089_Corpus_informed_discourse_analysis_The_case_of_academic_engagement","284472737_Modes_of_meaning_and_modes_of_expression_Types_of_grammatical_structure_and_their_determination_by_different_semantic_functions"]}
