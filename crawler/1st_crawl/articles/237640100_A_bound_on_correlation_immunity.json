{"id":"237640100_A_bound_on_correlation_immunity","abstract":"A new bound on correlation immunity of non-constant un- balanced Boolean functions is proved. The bound is applied to obtain a new necessary condition for existence of a perfect coloring of the hyper- cube with given parameters. The new bound is stronger than the bounds previously obtained by Bierbrauer and Tarannikov, and is reached on an infinite class of examples. In this note we prove a new bound on correlation immunity of unbalanced Boolean functions. This bound was conjectured by Yu. Tarannikov. Let › = f1;:::;ng. The powerset H = P(›) will be considered as the n- dimensional hypercube; two subsets being adjacent i","authors":["D. G.
