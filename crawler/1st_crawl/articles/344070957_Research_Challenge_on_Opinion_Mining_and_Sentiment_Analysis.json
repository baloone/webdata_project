{"id":"344070957_Research_Challenge_on_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to present an outline for discussion upon a new Research Challenge on Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis. This research challenge has been developed in the scope of project CROSSOVER “Bridging Communities for Next Generation Policy-Making” in the view of the definition of a new Research Roadmap on ICT Tools for Governance and Policy Making, building on the model and the research roadmap developed within the scope of the CROSSROAD project, but with a stronger focus on governance and policy modeling. To this aim CROSSOVER focuses on amending two Grand Challenges, already part of the\nCROSSROAD roadmap: GC1 ‐ Model‐based Collaborative Governance and GC2 ‐Data‐powered Collective Intelligence and Action. Each Grand Challenge consists in a number of research challenges. In particular the Grand Challenge 2 embeds the research challenge “Peer to peer public opinion mining”, which we aim to amend, update, improve and validate during the workshop.","authors":["Francesco Mureddu","David Osimo"],"meta":["September 2012"],"references":[]}
