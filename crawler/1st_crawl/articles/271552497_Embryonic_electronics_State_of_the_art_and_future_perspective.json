{"id":"271552497_Embryonic_electronics_State_of_the_art_and_future_perspective","abstract":"This paper gives out an overview of embryonic electronics (Embryonics) which provides an entirely new approach to design highly robust integrated circuits inspired by the embryonic development of living beings. After a general introduction of research concerning Embryonics, we investigate the current status of Embryonics, discuss the key technical issues and the challenges i. e. We are facing to develop practical and large-scale Embryonics. In addition, we indicate the areas of interest for future research.","authors":["Zhuo Qingqi","Qian Yanling","Li Yue","Wang Nantian"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1109/ICEMI.2013.6743098","Conference: 2013 IEEE 11th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments (ICEMI)"],"references":["243769404_A_multilayered_immune_system_for_hardware_fault_tolerance_within_an_embryonic_array","224588839_A_new_paradigm_for_developing_digital_systems_based_on_a_multi-cellular_organization","224078759_eDNA_A_Bio-Inspired_Reconfigurable_Hardware_Cell_Architecture_Supporting_Self-organisation_and_Self-healing","221431503_A_Hardware_Implementation_of_an_Embryonic_Architecture_Using_VirtexR_FPGAs","221431329_Ubichip_Ubidule_and_MarXbot_A_Hardware_Platform_for_the_Simulation_of_Complex_Systems","3965804_The_BioWall_an_electronic_tissue_for_prototyping_bio-inspired_systems","3351362_Design_of_a_basic_cell_to_construct_embryonic_arrays","3336972_Embryonics_A_New_Methodology_for_Designing_Field-Programmable_Gate_Arrays_with_Self-Repair_and_Self-Replicating_Properties","260655572_Self-Repairing_Digital_System_With_Unified_Recovery_Process_Inspired_by_Endocrine_Cellular_Communication","252020928_UNITRONICS_A_novel_bio-inspired_fault_tolerant_cellular_system","251919487_Fault-tolerance_abilities_implementation_with_spare_cells_in_bio-inspired_hardware_systems","241186815_The_future_of_embedded_systems_at_ESA_Towards_adaptability_and_reconfigurability","241169853_Development_of_hardware_redundant_embryonic_structure_for_high_reliability_control_applications","232624990_Prokaryotic_Bio-Inspired_System","232615578_Prokaryotic_Bio-Inspired_Model_for_Embryonics","226948982_Cellular-Array_Implementations_of_Bio-inspired_Self-healing_Systems_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Perspectives","224650567_Poetic_A_Hardware_Prototyping_Platform_With_Bioinspired_Capabilities","224166308_Bio-inspired_self-test_for_evolvable_fault_tolerant_hardware_systems","224145186_Self-organizing_and_fault-tolerant_behaviors_approach_in_bio-inspired_hardware_redundant_network_structures","224078757_Self-Testable_and_Self-Repairable_Bio-Inspired_Configurable_Circuits","221563054_Implementation_Results_for_a_Fault-Tolerant_Multicellular_Architecture_Inspired_by_Endocrine_Communication","221224868_FPGA_technology_mapping_with_encoded_libraries_and_staged_priority_cuts","220742028_Novel_bio-inspired_self-repair_algorithm_for_evolvable_fault_tolerant_hardware_systems","220286110_Cyclic_metamorphic_memory_for_cellular_bio-inspired_electronic_systems","37453788_Design_of_Self-organizing_Bio-inspired_Systems","8362965_POEtic_An_Electronic_Tissue_for_Bio-Inspired_Cellular_Applications","4359367_Bio-inspired_hardware_systems_development_and_implementation_with_FPGA-based_artificial_cell_network","4292462_Development_strategy_and_implementation_of_a_generalized_model_for_FPGA-based_artificial_cell_in_bio-inspired_hardware_systems","3965955_An_architecture_for_self-healing_digital_systems","3944452_Human_immune_system_inspired_architecture_for_self-healing_digital_systems","3864679_Toward_self-repairing_and_self-replicating_hardware_the_Embryonics_approach"]}
