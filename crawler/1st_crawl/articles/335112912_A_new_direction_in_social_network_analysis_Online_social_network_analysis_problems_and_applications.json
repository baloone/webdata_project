{"id":"335112912_A_new_direction_in_social_network_analysis_Online_social_network_analysis_problems_and_applications","abstract":"The use of online social networks has made significant progress in recent years as the use of the Internet has become widespread worldwide as the technological infrastructure and the use of technological products evolve. It has become more suitable to reach online social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn via the internet and web 3.0 technologies. Thus, people have shared their views on many different topics and their emotions with other users more widely on these platforms. This means that a huge amount of data is created on platforms where millions of people connect with each other through social networks. Nevertheless, the development of computational paradigms at high speed and complexity with technological possibilities allows analysis of valuable data by means of social network analysis methods. Our goal for this paper is to present a review of novel and popular online social network analysis problems with related applications and a reference work for researchers interested in analyzing online social network data and social network problems. Unlike other individual studies we have gathered 21 online social network problems and defined them with related studies. Thus, this study is original by presenting an important source of research by explaining the problems of online social network and the studies performed in this area.","authors":["Umit Can","Bilal
