{"id":"329493100_ACT-R_A_cognitive_architecture_for_modeling_cognition","abstract":"ACT‐R is a hybrid cognitive architecture. It is comprised of a set of programmable information processing mechanisms that can be used to predict and explain human behavior including cognition and interaction with the environment. We start by reviewing its history, which shapes its current form, contrasts and relates it to other architectures, and helps readers to anticipate where it is going. Based on this history, we then describe it as a theory of cognition that is realized as a computer program. After this, we briefly discuss tools for working with ACT‐R, and also note several major accomplishments that have been gained by working with ACT‐R in both basic and applied science, including summarizing some of the insights about human behavior. We conclude by discussing its future, which we believe will include adding emotions and physiology, increasing usability, and the use of nongenerative models.\nThis article is categorized under:\n\n• Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\n• Psychology > Reasoning and Decision Making\n• Psychology > Theory and Methods","authors":["Frank E.
