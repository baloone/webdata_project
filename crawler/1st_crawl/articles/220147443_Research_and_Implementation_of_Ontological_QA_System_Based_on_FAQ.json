{"id":"220147443_Research_and_Implementation_of_Ontological_QA_System_Based_on_FAQ","abstract":"The question-answer retrieval of ontology knowledge base provide a convenient way to obtain knowledge for users, but the natural language need to be mapped to the query statement of ontology. The scheme based on the set of Frequently Asked Questions is put forward in this paper. Being different from question-answer pair in popular FAQ, the question set in this paper is the set of question-query pattern pair. For obtaining the query pattern, the similarity of target question is computed in statistic and semantic modes separately, and then the query statement of target question is obtained, the ontology retrieval is implemented and the answer is extracted finally. The experiment result indicates that the MRR of this combined method reaches to 0.81.","authors":["Hanxing Liu","Xudong Lin","Caixing Liu"],"meta":["May 2010Journal of Convergence Information Technology 5(3):79-85","DOI:10.4156/jcit.vol5.issue3.12","SourceDBLP"],"references":["247698186_Talking_to_the_Semantic_Web_-_A_Controlled_English_Query_Interface_for_Ontologies","220605295_Question_Answering_from_Frequently_Asked_Question_Files_Experiences_with_the_FAQ_FINDER_System","220355522_Question_Answering_in_Restricted_Domains_An_Overview","42799287_AquaLog_An_Ontology-Portable_Question_Answering_System_for_the_Semantic_Web","298245957_Overview_of_researches_on_ontology","292009278_Constraints-based_semantic_mapping_method_from_natural_language_questions_to_OWL","245657050_Chinese_Question_Answering_System_Based_on_Frequently_Asked_Questions","222413395_Addressing_ontology-based_question_answering_with_collections_of_user_queries","4250577_A_Constraint-based_Method_for_Semantic_Mapping_from_Natural_Language_Questions_to_OWL"]}
