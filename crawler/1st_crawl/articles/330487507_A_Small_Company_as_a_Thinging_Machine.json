{"id":"330487507_A_Small_Company_as_a_Thinging_Machine","abstract":"Business process modeling has been applied through a modeling language and notation, such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) or Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). This paper proposes another diagrammatic language, called Thinging Machine (TM), and demonstrates its applicability as a modeling language with its own merits. The paper focuses on business process modeling in small companies. It presents a single case study of an actual small company that provides advertisement installation services and examines the current capabilities to construct a conceptual model that adopts systems thinking. This includes depicting the components of the company to deliver a holistic picture for the managers as they build new business models and evolve from their current design.","authors":["Sabah Al-Fedaghi","Hesah Aljenfawi"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1145/3285957.3285988","Conference: the 2018 10th International Conference","Project: Conference Paper A Small Company as a Thinging Machine"],"references":["225955640_Analysis_and_Design_of_Business_Processes_Using_BPMN","221586027_Business_Process_Management_A_Survey","321998953_Process_Modeling_for_Analysis_and_Control_A_Case_Study_of_IT_Services","320508080_Integrated_Modeling_Methodologies_and_Languages","319351074_Orientation_in_Conceptual_Modeling_Frameworks","317235560_Cognitive_Insights_into_Business_Process_Model_Comprehension_Preliminary_Results_for_Experienced_and_Inexperienced_Individuals","317135705_Business_model_innovation_processes_in_large_corporations_insights_from_BASF","316817423_Architecture_of_Integrated_Information_Systems","314116090_Context-Aware_Software_Systems_Toward_a_Diagrammatic_Modeling_Foundation","312665036_Flow-based_systems_modelling_application_in_airport_system_description","309478956_Activity_Recognition_and_Sensor_Positioning","287880595_'Object-Thing_Philosophy'_and_Design_Review_of_B_Latour_and_P_Weibel_Making_Things_Public_G_Harman_Tool-Being_and_Guerrilla_Metaphysics_Peter-Paul_Verbeek_What_Things_DoI","262249906_Schematizing_Proofs_Based_on_Flow_of_Truth_Values_in_Logic","235265681_Business_process_management_BPM_standards_A_survey","226789233_What_is_Business_Process_Management","221320169_Ercatons_Thing-Oriented_Programming","2621771_Innovation_In_Analogical_Design_A_Model-Based_Approach","2474094_Business_Process_Management_A_Survey"]}
