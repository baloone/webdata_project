{"id":"317306762_DISOCCLUSION_OF_3D_LIDAR_POINT_CLOUDS_USING_RANGE_IMAGES","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel framework for the disocclusion of mobile objects in 3D LiDAR scenes aquired via street-based Mobile\nMapping Systems (MMS). Most of the existing lines of research tackle this problem directly in the 3D space. This work promotes an\nalternative approach by using a 2D range image representation of the 3D point cloud, taking advantage of the fact that the problem of\ndisocclusion has been intensively studied in the 2D image processing community over the past decade. First, the point cloud is turned\ninto a 2D range image by exploiting the sensor’s topology. Using the range image, a semi-automatic segmentation procedure based on\ndepth histograms is performed in order to select the occluding object to be removed. A variational image inpainting technique is then\nused to reconstruct the area occluded by that object. Finally, the range image is unprojected as a 3D point cloud. Experiments on real\ndata prove the effectiveness of this procedure both in terms of accuracy and speed.","authors":["P. Biasutti","J.-F.
