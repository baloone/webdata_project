{"id":"276297025_On_the_Systematic_Constructions_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Bent_Functions_with_Any_Possible_Algebraic_Degrees","abstract":"In the literature, few constructions of $n$-variable rotation symmetric bent\nfunctions have been presented, which either have restriction on $n$ or have\nalgebraic degree no more than $4$. In this paper, for any even integer\n$n=2m\\ge2$, a first systemic construction of $n$-variable rotation symmetric\nbent functions, with any possible algebraic degrees ranging from $2$ to $m$, is\nproposed.","authors":["Sihong Su","Xiaohu Tang"],"meta":["May 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304142209_Decomposing_bent_functions","295252630_Results_on_Constructions_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Bent_and_Semi-bent_Functions","263391451_A_secondary_construction_and_a_transformation_on_rotation_symmetric_functions_and_their_action_on_bent_and_semi-bent_functions","254060734_Constructions_of_Quadratic_and_Cubic_Rotation_Symmetric_Bent_Functions","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","223319299_Rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions-Count_and_cryptographic_properties","222517024_Results_on_rotation_symmetric_bent_functions","222399267_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_-_Count_and_Cryptographic_Properties","220683310_Maximal_Families_of_Bent_Sequences","220680211_Bent-function_sequences"]}
