{"id":"320046236_Modeling_and_Reasoning_about_Preference-Based_Context-Aware_Agents_over_Heterogeneous_Knowledge_Sources","abstract":"This paper presents a conceptual framework and multi-agent model for context-aware decision support in dynamic smart environments based on heterogeneous knowledge sources. A Protégé plug-in for rules extraction from distributed ontologies has been developed, which allows us to model context-aware agents using the notion of multi-context systems. Extracted rules can be annotated to match the users’ needs and to develop a preference model to support their preferences so as to provide a user with a more personalized services. The use of the proposed framework is illustrated using a simple fact-based preference model developed from ontologies considering two different smart environment domains.","authors":["Ijaz Uddin","Abdur Rakib","Hafiz Mahfooz Ul Haque","Phan Cong Vinh"],"meta":["February 2018Mobile Networks and Applications 23(3-4):1-14","DOI:10.1007/s11036-017-0899-5"],"references":["318180436_A_Preference-Based_Application_Framework_for_Resource-Bounded_Context-Aware_Agents","318108035_A_Preference-Based_Application_Framework_for_Resource-Bounded_Context-Aware_Agents","311650088_A_Framework_for_Implementing_Formally_Verified_Resource-Bounded_Smart_Space_Systems","305647690_PARE_Profile-Applied_Reasoning_Engine_for_Context-Aware_System","297322975_Is_context-aware_computing_taking_control_away_from_the_user_Three_levels_of_interactivity_examined","270753086_Finding_Explanations_of_Inconsistency_in_Multi-Context_Systems","268278591_A_Logic_for_Context-Aware_Non-monotonic_Reasoning_Agents","228542118_Using_Semantic_Web_Services_for_Context-Aware_Mobile_Applications","298019260_Out_of_oontext_Computer_systems_that_adapt_to_and_learn_from_context","238699626_Working_with_Multiple_Ontologies_on_the_Semantic_Web_Bernardo_Cuenca"]}
