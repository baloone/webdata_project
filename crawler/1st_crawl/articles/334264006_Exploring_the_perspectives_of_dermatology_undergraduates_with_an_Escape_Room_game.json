{"id":"334264006_Exploring_the_perspectives_of_dermatology_undergraduates_with_an_Escape_Room_game","abstract":"Introduction: \nA UK dermatology curricula review has argued that undergraduate delivery relies on lectures and is subject to clinical and staffing pressures. Many UK undergraduate students feel less than adequately prepared to manage dermatological conditions and misconceptions are common regarding dermatology. Educators have called for innovative solutions, including small group teaching. Escape rooms are games requiring teams to solve puzzles to escape from a room.\n\nAim: \nThis study aimed to assess impact of an escape room game on perceptions of dermatology amongst undergraduate medical students.\n\nMethods: \nStudents were invited to an escape room to consolidate lessons taught in a previous lecture. Students were first asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their preferred learning environments, perceptions of dermatology and confidence in content. Following the escape room these questions were revisited. Focus groups were then held to explore themes raised.\n\nResults: \n16 students took part in escape room sessions, and 3 focus groups. Feedback was strongly positive, with 100% of students expressing 'strongly agree' on whether they enjoyed the session. Qualitative data were coded for themes of accessibility, variety of taught content and awareness. 94% of students stated the escape room made them want to experience more dermatology.\n\nDiscussion: \nPrejudices regarding dermatology exist amongst medical students, and may act as a barrier to perceived accessibility to the specialty. Escape rooms can provide a shift to a more learner-centred approach which may aid in combatting negative perceptions. They may act as an enjoyable means of consolidating lecture-based and clinical teaching, requiring minimal resources. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.","authors":["J.
