{"id":"24414213_Data_mining_techniques_for_detection_of_sleep_arousals","abstract":"Arousals are considered one of the main causes of daytime sleepiness. They impede the proper flow of sleep cycles and cause weariness. Manual scoring of arousals is time-consuming, requires expert knowledge, and has high inter-scorer variability. A major difficulty in detecting arousals automatically is the existing variance across patients. Based on data mining techniques, we present a different approach to the automatic detection of arousals that overcomes the hurdle of differences in signal characteristics across patients. Offline we used a training-set of adult patients to define a set of general rules to detect arousals (termed meta-rules). This was done by analyzing the correlations between occurrences of arousals and the EEG, EMG, pulse and SaO2 signals as follows: (1) each signal was mathematically projected into several spaces (termed projected-signals); (2) from each such projected-signal, the algorithm extracted time points that indicated meaningful changes (termed critical-points); (3) data mining techniques were applied to all the critical-points to discover patterns of repeating behavior; (4) classes of patterns which were highly correlated with manually scored arousals were formalized as meta-rules. Online we used a test-set of adult patients from two other different sleep laboratories. Using the meta-rules, the algorithm extracted individual rules for each patient (termed actual-rules), and used them to automatically detect the patients' arousals. These arousals were significantly correlated (R=0.88, p<0.0001; sensitivity=75.2%, positive predictive value=76.5%) with those detected manually by experts. Since the total number of arousals is a measure of sleep quality, this algorithm constitutes a novel approach to automatically estimate sleep quality.","authors":["Oren Shmiel","Tomer Shmiel","Yaron Dagan","Mina Teicher"],"meta":["June 2009Journal of Neuroscience Methods 179(2):331-7","DOI:10.1016/j.jneumeth.2009.01.035","SourcePubMed"],"references":["279892702_EEG_arousals_Scoring_rules_and_examples_A_preliminary_report_from_the_Sleep_Disorders_Atlas_Task_Force_of_the_American_Sleep_Disorder_Association","9031236_An_automatic_ambulatory_device_for_detection_of_AASM_defined_arousals_from_sleep_The_WP100","6564633_Detecting_REM_sleep_from_the_finger_An_automatic_REM_sleep_algorithm_based_on_peripheral_arterial_tone_PAT_and_actigraphy","3036763_Processing_of_Multichannel_Recordings_for_Data-Mining_Algorithms","312900027_EEG_arousals_Scoring_rules_and_examples","298657858_Detection_of_cortical_EEG_arousals_from_a_Neural_Network_NN_analysis","295251838_Atlas_of_Sleep_Medicine","292768757_30_th_annual_international_conference_of_the_IEEE_engineering_in_medicine_and_biology_society","291821361_Data_Mining_Methods_for_Knowledge_Discovery","267109703_Fuzzy_Modeling_and_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Data_Mining_and_Exploration","262189134_A_Manual_Of_Standardized_Terminology_Techniques_And_Scoring_System_For_Sleep_Stages_In_Human_Subjects","246898633_Atlas_of_sleep_medicine","243575488_Discovering_frequent_episodes_in_event_sequences","241677645_Data_Mining_Concepts_Models_Methods_and_Algorithms_Second_Edition","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","222850558_Stochastic_resonance_in_a_bistable_system","222473678_Clustering_to_minimize_the_maximum_intercluster_distance","221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm","221654616_Discovering_Frequent_Episodes_in_Sequences","43354345_Statistical-Methods_For_Assessing_Agreement_Between_2_Methods_Of_Clinical_Measurement","14583121_The_effect_of_sleep_fragmentation_on_daytime_function","14425617_Automated_Recognition_of_EEG_Changes_Accompanying_Arousal_in_Respiratory_Sleep_Disorders","14251799_Evaluation_of_activity-based_techniques_to_identify_transient_arousal_in_respiratory_sleep_disorders","14063434_The_effect_of_nonvisible_sleep_fragmentation_on_daytime_function","14063419_Sleep_fragmentation_and_daytime_wakefulness","13585384_Interobserver_Variability_in_Recognizing_Arousal_in_Respiratory_Sleep_Disorders","13386973_Theory_of_stochastic_resonance","12848447_A_Method_for_the_Automatic_Detection_of_Arousals_During_Sleep","12734139_Night-to-Night_Arousal_Variability_and_Interscorer_Reliability_of_Arousal_Measurements","6523148_Automatic_Detection_of_Micro-Arousals","6521545_Detection_of_Arousals_in_Patients_with_Respiratory_Sleep_Disorders_Using_a_Single_Channel_EEG","3884979_Automated_detection_of_obstructive_sleep-disordered_breathing_events_using_peripheral_arterial_tonometry_and_oximetry","2613171_Discovering_Generalized_Episodes_Using_Minimal_Occurrences"]}
