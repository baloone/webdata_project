{"id":"254272604_The_effects_of_age_gender_and_computer_experience_upon_computer_attitudes","abstract":"The effects of age, gender and prior computing experience upon attitudes towards computers were investigated in 278 secondary school pupils drawn from the 11‐12 and 15‐16 years age‐groups. Males from both age‐groups reported greater experience with and more positive attitudes towards computers than females. Younger pupils, both male and female, were found to have greater experience with and more positive attitudes towards computers than older pupils. After controlling for ownership and use of a home computer by means of analyses of covariance, female and male pupils reported similar levels of enjoyment of computers, but age differences in enjoyment and gender and age differences in confidence with computers remained significant. Similar analyses using length of experience as a covariate did not significantly affect gender or age differences. The need to investigate and address the level of confidence of female pupils is briefly discussed.","authors":["Chris Comber","Ann Colley","David J Hargreaves","Lisa Dorn"],"meta":["June 1997Educational Research 39(2):123-133","DOI:10.1080/0013188970390201"],"references":["343919399_Gender_and_the_sciences_pupils'_gender-based_conceptions_of_school_subjects","275626524_Gender_Experience_and_Attributions_to_the_Computer","249732823_Femmes_ingenieurs_Une_irresistible_ascension","247764118_Gender_and_Socioeconomic_Status_Differences_in_Middle-School_Computer_Interest_and_Use","247763777_Gender_and_Computer_Experience_as_Factors_in_the_Computer_Attitudes_of_Middle_School_Students","242417043_Gender_and_Computers_The_Beneficial_Effects_of_Experience_on_Attitudes","234558154_Gender_Similarities_and_Differences_in_Sixth_Graders'_Attitudes_toward_Computers_An_Exploratory_Study","232484879_Psychosocial_implications_of_sex_differences_in_attitudes_toward_computers_Results_of_a_survey","227259261_Boys_girls_and_microcomputing","226935704_Sex_differences_on_the_California_statewide_assessment_of_computer_literacy"]}
