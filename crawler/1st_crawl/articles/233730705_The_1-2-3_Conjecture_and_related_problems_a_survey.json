{"id":"233730705_The_1-2-3_Conjecture_and_related_problems_a_survey","abstract":"The 1-2-3 Conjecture, posed in 2004 by Karonski, Luczak, and Thomason, is as\nfollows: \"If G is a graph with no connected component having exactly 2\nvertices, then the edges of G may be assigned weights from the set {1,2,3} so\nthat, for any adjacent vertices u and v, the sum of weights of edges incident\nto u differs from the sum of weights of edges incident to v.\" This survey paper\npresents the current state of research on the 1-2-3 Conjecture and the many\nvariants that have been proposed in its short but active history.","authors":["Ben Seamone"],"meta":["November 2012","SourcearXiv","Project: 1-2-3 Conjecture"],"references":["304400970_Vertex_Coloring_of_Graphs_by_Total_2-Weightings","278629077_Detection_number_of_bipartite_graphs_and_cubic_graphs","319583303_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","312652710_Vertex-distinguishing_proper_edge-colourings","273798010_Graph_Theory","270589594_Product_Irregularity_Strength_of_Graphs","266522691_The_line-distinguishing_chromatic_number_of_a_graph","266270794_Graphs_with_the_line-distinguishing_chromatic_number_equal_to_the_usual_one","265956312_Vertex-coloring_Edge-weightings_of_Graphs","265756771_On_the_adjacent-vertex-_-distinguishing_index_by_sums_in_total_proper_colorings"]}
