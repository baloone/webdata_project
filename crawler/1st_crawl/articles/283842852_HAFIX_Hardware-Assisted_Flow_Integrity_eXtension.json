{"id":"283842852_HAFIX_Hardware-Assisted_Flow_Integrity_eXtension","abstract":"Code-reuse attacks like return-oriented programming (ROP) pose a severe threat to modern software on diverse processor architectures. Designing practical and secure defenses against code-reuse attacks is highly challenging and currently subject to intense research. However, no secure and practical system-level solutions exist so far, since a large number of proposed defenses have been successfully bypassed. To tackle this attack, we present H AFIX (Hardware-Assisted Flow Integrity eXtension), a defense against code-reuse attacks exploiting backward edges (returns). H AFIX provides fine-grained and practical protection, and serves as an enabling technology for future control-flow integrity instantiations. This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of HAFIX for the IntelÂ® Siskiyou Peak and SPARC embedded system architectures, and demonstrates its security and efficiency in code-reuse protection while incurring only 2% performance overhead.","authors":["Lucas Davi","Matthias Hanreich","Debayan Paul","Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1145/2744769.2744847"],"references":["261243181_CFIMon_Detecting_violation_of_control_flow_integrity_using_performance_counters","254045453_Branch_regulation_Low-overhead_protection_from_code_reuse_attacks","221608984_Return-Oriented_Programming_without_Returns","310403126_Stitching_the_gadgets_On_the_ineffectiveness_of_coarse-grained_control-flow_integrity_protection","310403104_Enforcing_forward-edge_control-flow_integrity_in_GCC_LLVM","287044145_Out_of_Control_Overcoming_Control-Flow_Integrity","283098135_The_Performance_Cost_of_Shadow_Stacks_and_Stack_Canaries","274503059_Branch_regulation","266657436_Hardware-Assisted_Fine-Grained_Control-Flow_Integrity_Towards_Efficient_Protection_of_Embedded_Systems_Against_Software_Exploitation","262215941_Control_flow_integrity_for_COTS_binaries","262169998_Transparent_ROP_exploit_mitigation_using_indirect_branch_tracing","236496606_Extreme_Scale_Computing_to_Secure_the_Nation","228733728_Control-flow_integrity_principles_implementations_and_applications","221609643_The_Geometry_of_Innocent_Flesh_on_the_Bone","221609442_Code_Injection_Attacks_on_Harvard-Architecture_Devices","220938850_Architectural_support_for_software-based_protection","220593585_Control-flow_integrity_Principles_implementations_and_applications"]}
