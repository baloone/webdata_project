{"id":"335660837_Collaboration_Based_Multi-Label_Learning","abstract":"It is well-known that exploiting label correlations is crucially important to multi-label learning. Most of the existing approaches take label correlations as prior knowledge, which may not correctly characterize the real relationships among labels. Besides, label correlations are normally used to regularize the hypothesis space, while the final predictions are not explicitly correlated. In this paper, we suggest that for each individual label, the final prediction involves the collaboration between its own prediction and the predictions of other labels. Based on this assumption, we first propose a novel method to learn the label correlations via sparse reconstruction in the label space. Then, by seamlessly integrating the learned label correlations into model training, we propose a novel multi-label learning approach that aims to explicitly account for the correlated predictions of labels while training the desired model simultaneously. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.","authors":["Lei Feng","Bo An","Shuo He"],"meta":["July 2019Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 33:3550-3557","DOI:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013550"],"references":["313656130_Correlation-based_pruning_of_stacked_binary_relevance_models_for_multi-label_learning","270337594_A_Tutorial_on_Multi-Label_Learning","263813673_A_Review_On_Multi-Label_Learning_Algorithms","258946535_Multi-Label_Image_Annotations_Using_New_Graph_Structured_Sparsity_Model","221653587_Extracting_Shared_Subspace_for_Multi-label_Classification","221346480_Large_Scale_Max-Margin_Multi-Label_Classification_with_Priors","221344712_Hierarchical_classification_Combining_Bayes_with_SVM","221299720_Multi-labelled_classification_using_maximum_entropy_method","220320445_MULAN_A_Java_library_for_multi-label_learning","220073602_Random_k-Labelsets_for_Multi-Label_Classification","3297607_Multilabel_Neural_Networks_with_Applications_to_Functional_Genomics_and_Text_Categorization","315795379_Multi-Label_Learning_with_Global_and_Local_Label_Correlation","313732929_Joint_Feature_Selection_and_Classification_for_Multilabel_Learning","310021439_Exploit_Bounding_Box_Annotations_for_Multi-Label_Object_Recognition","309056065_Learning_Label-Specific_Features_and_Class-Dependent_Labels_for_Multi-Label_Classification","306157345_Submodular_Multi-Label_Learning","275149170_Supervised_topic_models_for_multi-label_classification","225672307_Biconvex_sets_and_optimization_with_biconvex_functions_A_survey_and_extensions","222430151_Learning_multi-label_scene_classification","221619768_A_Kernel_Method_for_Multi-Labelled_Classification","221301188_Multilabel_Classification_with_Meta-level_Features"]}
