{"id":"318200279_Delivering_Elastic_Containerized_Cloud_Applications_to_Enable_DevOps","abstract":"Following recent technological advancements in software systems, like microservices, containers and cloud systems, DevOps has risen as a new development paradigm. Its aim is to bridge the gap between development and management of software systems and enable continuous development, deployment and integration. Towards this end, automated tools and management systems play a crucial role. In this work, we propose a method to develop an autonomic management system for multitier, multi-layer data-intensive containerized applications based on a performance model of such systems. The model is shown to be robust and accurate in estimating and predicting the system's performance for various workloads and topologies, while the AMS is capable of regulating the application's behaviour by taking independent actions on its various parts.","authors":["Cornel Barna","Hamzeh Khazaei","Marios Fokaefs","Marin Litoiu"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1109/SEAMS.2017.12","Conference: Proceedings of the 12th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing SystemsAt: IEEE PressVolume: 65-75","Project: Smart Application on Virtual Infrastructure (SAVI)"],"references":["298902672_Microservices_Architecture_Enables_DevOps_an_Experience_Report_on_Migration_to_a_Cloud-Native_Architecture","315495774_DevOps_for_Developers","305302493_Performance_comparison_between_Linux_containers_and_virtual_machines","303281772_Software_engineering_for_self-adaptive_systems_A_second_research_roadmap","301639449_Being_a_DevOps_Developer","301639252_DevOps_and_Its_Practices","301564573_DevOps_A_Software_Architect's_Perspective","301442872_Lightweight_Adaptive_Filtering_for_Efficient_Learning_and_Updating_of_Probabilistic_Models","298902391_Chaos_Engineering","262315852_Distributed_application-level_monitoring_for_heterogeneous_clouds_using_stream_processing"]}
