{"id":"226808260_The_Salsa20_Family_of_Stream_Ciphers","abstract":"Salsa20 is a family of 256-bit stream ciphers designed in 2005 and submitted to eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project.\nSalsa20 has progressed to the third round of eSTREAM without any changes. The 20-round stream cipher Salsa20/20 is consistently\nfaster than AES and is recommended by the designer for typical cryptographic applications. The reduced-round ciphers Salsa20/12\nand Salsa20/8 are among the fastest 256-bit stream ciphers available and are recommended for applications where speed is more\nimportant than confidence. The fastest known attacks use ≈ 2153 simple operations against Salsa20/7, ≈ 2249 simple operations against Salsa20/8, and ≈ 2255 simple operations against Salsa20/9, Salsa20/10, etc. In this paper, the Salsa20 designer presents Salsa20 and discusses\nthe decisions made in the Salsa20 design.","authors":["Daniel J.
