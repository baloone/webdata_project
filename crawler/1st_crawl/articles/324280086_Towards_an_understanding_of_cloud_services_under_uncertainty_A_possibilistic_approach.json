{"id":"324280086_Towards_an_understanding_of_cloud_services_under_uncertainty_A_possibilistic_approach","abstract":"With the development ofWeb technologies and the increasing use of the Internet,\nmore and more web services are being deployed. This gave birth to what called\ncloud services, which are widely used for building distributed cloud applications.\nWith cloud-based service delivery, it seems hard for users to find the right\nservice for their needs. However, if a single cloud service cannot meet all user\nrequirements, a cloud service composition is required. With the rise of Web\nservices on the Internet, the quality of response has been considered as an\nimportant criterion to choose the most relevant answer. The performance of\nweb services may vary depending on the dynamic Internet environment, which\nmakes the quality of service uncertain. Then, the need to deal with uncertainty\nin the operation of cloud services. Over the past decade, several approaches\nto service composition have been proposed to cope with this challenge. In this\narticle, we provide a \nexible and effecient cloud services composition framework\nthat can respond to user queries and improve cloud services composition results\nby exploiting data uncertainty. We then introduce an effective strategy that\nallows modeling, invocation, and composition of services by dealing with data\nuncertainty. The experimental evaluation of a real case study demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our proposed strategy.","authors":["Asma Omri","Karim Benouaret","Djamal Benslimane","Mohamed Nazih Omri"],"meta":["April 2018International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 98","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2018.04.004","Project: Discovery of web services."],"references":["311085484_Querying_Data_Services_in_an_Uncertain_Environment_A_Possibilistic-Based_Approach","281640551_Classifying_and_Filtering_Users_by_Similarity_Measures_for_Trust_Management_in_Cloud_Environment","281602146_Uncertainty_representation_and_combination_new_results_with_application_to_nuclear_safety_issues","312060039_Uncertainty-aware_adaptive_service_composition_in_cloud_computing","311388021_FUNCTIONAL_DEPENDENCIES_AND_INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION","305263241_Incomplete_information_and_dependencies_in_relational_databases","304564688_A_mathematical_theory_of_evidence","290165116_Imperfect_information_Imprecision_and_uncertainty_in_A_Motro_and_P_Smets_Eds_Uncertainty_Management_in_Information_Systems_From_Needs_to_Solutions","288887283_The_Uncertain_Web_Concepts_Challenges_and_Current_Solutions","286668691_Handling_Uncertainty_in_Data_Services_Composition","270594091_Survey_of_Uncertainty_Handling_in_Cloud_Service_Discovery_and_Composition","269931103_Data_Services_with_uncertain_and_correlated_semantics","278827595_Semantic_modeling_for_cloud_computing_toward_Daas_service_composition_with_uncertain_semantics","267109921_Theory_of_Random_Sets","261346714_Selecting_Skyline_Web_Services_from_Uncertain_QoS"]}
