{"id":"274730360_Rainbow_Connection_in_Some_Digraphs","abstract":"An edge-coloured graph $G$ is {\\it rainbow connected} if any two vertices are\nconnected by a path whose edges have distinct colours. This concept was\nintroduced by Chartrand et al. in \\cite{ch01}, and it was extended to oriented\ngraphs by Dorbec et al. in \\cite{DI}.\nIn this paper we present some results regarding this extention, mostly for\nthe case of circulant digraphs.","authors":["Jes√∫s Alva Samos","J.
