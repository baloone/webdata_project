Using the differential inequality theory and Lyapunov functional method, a set of sufficient conditions which ascertains that the existence and exponential stability of anti-periodic solutions of neutral shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks with time-varying delays and D operator are derived. Computer simulations are delineated to substantiate the correctness of our theoretical predictions. The obtained results of this paper are new and complement some earlier works.","authors":["Changjin Xu","Peiluan Li"],"meta":["September 2017Neurocomputing 275","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2017.08.030"],"references":["308741035_Existence_and_-exponential_stability_of_periodic_solution_for_stochastic_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays","311334048_An_application_of_two-phase_1DV_model_in_studying_sedimentary_processes_on_an_erosional_mudflat_at_Yangtze_River_Delta_China","304805636_Anti-periodic_solutions_of_Cohen-Grossberg_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_on_time_scales","300086591_Global_exponential_stability_of_complex-valued_neural_networks_with_both_time-varying_delays_and_impulsive_effects","299443317_LMI-based_global_exponential_stability_of_equilibrium_point_for_neutral_delayed_BAM_neural_networks_with_delays_in_leakage_terms_via_new_inequality_technique","290624517_On_almost_automorphic_solutions_for_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays_in_leakage_terms_on_time_scales1","288890284_SICNNs_with_Li-Yorke_chaotic_outputs_on_a_time_scale","284019080_Existence_and_Exponential_Stability_of_Periodic_Solution_to_Fuzzy_Cellular_Neural_Networks_with_Distributed_Delays","282899166_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_for_SICNNs_with_Leakage_Delays_and_Complex_Deviating_Arguments","282626722_New_results_on_anti-periodic_solutions_for_SICNNs_with_oscillating_coefficients_in_leakage_terms","278173952_Almost_automorphic_solution_for_neutral_type_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_delays_in_leakage_terms_on_time_scales","275366672_Periodic_solution_for_state-dependent_impulsive_shunting_inhibitory_CNNs_with_time-varying_delays","273754344_Anti-periodic_solutions_for_BAM_neural_networks_with_time_delays","270994842_Anti-periodic_solution_for_impulsive_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_leakage_delays_on_time_scales","268690823_The_existence_and_stability_of_the_anti-periodic_solution_for_delayed_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_impulsive_effects","268156083_Existence_and_stability_of_pseudo_almost_periodic_solutions_for_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_neutral_type_delays_and_time-varying_leakage_delays","264200986_On_Antiperiodic_Solutions_for_Cohen-Grossberg_Shunting_Inhibitory_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Delays_and_Impulses","257352165_Anti-periodic_solutions_for_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays_in_leakage_terms","253137763_Analysis_and_analog_implementation_of_directionally_sensitive_shunting_inhibitory_neural_networks","251678642_Antiperiodic_solution_for_delayed_cellular_neural_networks_with_impulsive_effects","251635153_Antiperiodic_solutions_to_impulsive_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_distributed_delays_on_time_scales","238510149_A_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_network_with_continuously_distributed_delays_of_neutral_type","229369127_Almost_periodic_solutions_for_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_without_global_Lipschitz_activaty_functions","220513119_On_global_exponential_stability_for_impulsive_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays"]}
