{"id":"258819223_Equivalence_for_Rank-Metric_and_Matrix_Codes_and_Automorphism_Groups_of_Gabidulin_Codes","abstract":"For a growing number of applications such as cellular, peer-to-peer, and\nsensor networks, efficient error-free transmission of data through a\nnetwork is essential. Toward this end, K\\\"{o}tter and Kschischang\npropose the use of subspace codes to provide error correction in the\nnetwork coding context. The primary construction for subspace codes is\nthe lifting of rank-metric or matrix codes, a process that preserves the\nstructural and distance properties of the underlying code. Thus, to\ncharacterize the structure and error-correcting capability of these\nsubspace codes, it is valuable to perform such a characterization of the\nunderlying rank-metric and matrix codes. This paper lays a foundation\nfor this analysis through a framework for classifying rank-metric and\nmatrix codes based on their structure and distance properties. To enable\nthis classification, we extend work by Berger on equivalence for\nrank-metric codes to define a notion of equivalence for matrix codes,\nand we characterize the group structure of the collection of maps that\npreserve such equivalence. We then compare the notions of equivalence\nfor these two related types of codes and show that matrix equivalence is\nstrictly more general than rank-metric equivalence. Finally, we\ncharacterize the set of equivalence maps that fix the prominent class of\nrank-metric codes known as Gabidulin codes. In particular, we give a\ncomplete characterization of the rank-metric automorphism group of\nGabidulin codes, correcting work by Berger, and give a partial\ncharacterization of the matrix-automorphism group of the expanded matrix\ncodes that arise from Gabidulin codes.","authors":["Katherine Morrison"],"meta":["April 2013IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 60(11)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2014.2359198"],"references":["268688672_Live_migration_of_virtual_machines","254464741_Surviving_Failures_in_Bandwidth-Constrained_Datacenters","253400479_Flyways_to_DeCongest_Data_Center_Networks","235008632_Theory_of_codes_with_maximum_rank_distance_translation","234828564_VL2_A_scalable_and_flexible_data_center_network","228588937_Network-aware_Migration_Control_and_Scheduling_of_Differentiated_Virtual_Machine_Workloads","224257346_Improving_Performance_and_Availability_of_Services_Hosted_on_IaaS_Clouds_with_Structural_Constraint-Aware_Virtual_Machine_Placement","221611973_The_nature_of_datacenter_traffic_Measurements_analysis","221461239_pMapper_Power_and_Migration_Cost_Aware_Application_Placement_in_Virtualized_Systems","221458899_Mistral_Dynamically_Managing_Power_Performance_and_Adaptation_Cost_in_Cloud_Infrastructures","221245216_Consolidating_virtual_machines_with_dynamic_bandwidth_demand_in_data_centers","221198552_VMFlow_Leveraging_VM_Mobility_to_Reduce_Network_Power_Costs_in_Data_Centers","221164260_Improving_Datacenter_Performance_and_Robustness_with_Multipath_TCP","220832059_Black-box_and_Gray-box_Strategies_for_Virtual_Machine_Migration","220195289_The_Cost_of_a_Cloud_Research_Problems_in_Data_Center_Networks","30763733_A_Random_Linear_Network_Coding_Approach_to_Multicast","3958820_Beyond_routing_An_algebraic_approach_to_network_coding","3077272_Array_codes","2103190_Self-Dual_Codes","292040583_Codes_and_groups_handbook_of_coding_theory","280148602_Equivalence_and_duality_for_rank-metric_and_matrix_codes","262356413_Remedy_Network-Aware_Steady_State_VM_Management_for_Data_Centers","254038533_A_Stable_Network-Aware_VM_Placement_for_Cloud_Systems","246698508_Linear_Transformations_on_Algebras_of_Matrices","245695490_Combinatorial_problems_of_elementary_abelian_groups","232617314_Multi-Objective_Virtual_Machine_Placement_in_Virtualized_Data_Center_Environments","229005900_Duality_theory_for_space-time_codes_over_finite_fields","225997042_Structural_Attacks_for_Public_Key_Cryptosystems_based_on_Gabidulin_Codes","224136906_The_Impact_of_Virtualization_on_Network_Performance_of_Amazon_EC2_Data_Center","224136905_Improving_the_Scalability_of_Data_Center_Networks_with_Traffic-aware_Virtual_Machine_Placement","221611932_Network_Traffic_Characteristics_of_Data_Centers_in_the_Wild","221164412_A_scalable_commodity_data_center_network_architecture","220682991_Network_Information_Flow","220639103_Attacks_and_counter-attacks_on_the_GPT_public_key_cryptosystem","220269636_CloudCmp_Comparing_Public_Cloud_Providers","4354525_ReCon_A_tool_to_Recommend_dynamic_server_Consolidation_in_multi-cluster_data_centers","3087016_A_Rank-Metric_Approach_to_Error_Control_in_Random_Network_Coding","3086943_Coding_for_Errors_and_Erasures_in_Random_Network_Coding","3084882_Isometries_for_Rank_Distance_and_Permutation_Group_of_Gabidulin_Codes","3084630_Linear_network_coding","2886291_Practical_Network_Coding"]}
