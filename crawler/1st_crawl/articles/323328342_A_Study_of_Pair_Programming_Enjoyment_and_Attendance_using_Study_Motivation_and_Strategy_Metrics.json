{"id":"323328342_A_Study_of_Pair_Programming_Enjoyment_and_Attendance_using_Study_Motivation_and_Strategy_Metrics","abstract":"We explore educational pair programming in a university context with high student autonomy and individual responsibility. The data comes from two separate introductory programming courses with optional pair programming assignments. We analyze lab attendance and course outcomes to determine whether students' previous programming experience or gender influence attendance. We further compare these statistics to self-reported data on study motivation, study strategies, and student enjoyment of pair programming. The influence of grading systems on pair programming behavior and course outcomes is also examined. Our results suggest that gender and previous programming experience correlate with participation in pair programming labs. At the same time, there are no significant differences in self-reported enjoyment of pair programming between any of the groups, and the results from commonly used study motivation and strategy questionnaires provide little insight into students/ actual behavior.","authors":["Onni Aarne","Petrus Peltola","Juho Leinonen","Arto Hellas"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1145/3159450.3159493","Conference: the 49th ACM Technical Symposium"],"references":["271429287_A_Manual_for_the_Use_of_the_Motivated_Strategies_for_Learning_Questionnaire_MSLQ","260980099_Retaining_Nearly_One-third_More_Majors_with_a_Trio_of_Instructional_Best_Practices_in_CS1","229028155_Adoption_of_Pair_Programming_in_the_Academic_Environment_with_Different_Degree_of_Complexity_in_Students_Perspective-An_Empirical_Study","228818416_Virtual_teaming_Experiments_and_experiences_with_distributed_pair_programming","228340340_Investigating_pair-programming_in_a_2_nd-year_software_development_and_design_computer_science_course","225130266_Virtual_Teaming_Experiments_and_Experiences_with_Distributed_Pair_Programming","221538551_Learning_styles_and_performance_in_an_introductory_programming_sequence","221494979_Pair_Programming_What's_in_it_for_Me","221368172_Increased_Retention_of_Early_Computer_Science_and_Software_Engineering_Students_Using_Pair_Programming","220808158_Program_quality_with_pair_programming_in_CS1","220707017_Management_structures_and_tools_to_scale_up_personal_advising_in_large_programming_courses","220420326_Teaching_the_Nintendo_generation_to_program","220094545_Pair-Programming_Helps_Female_Computer_Science_Students","37145770_Code_warriors_and_code-a-phobes_a_study_in_attitude_and_pair_programming","4194197_Effects_of_pair_programming_at_the_development_team_level_An_experiment","4038456_Building_pair_programming_knowledge_through_a_family_of_experiments","4016721_The_impact_of_pair_programming_on_student_performance_perception_and_persistence","2859132_Exploring_the_Efficacy_of_Distributed_Pair_Programming","2333697_The_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Pair_Programming","327252722_Anatomy_of_an_Enduring_Gender_Gap_The_Evolution_of_Women's_Participation_in_Computer_Science","311476298_Combating_the_code_warrior_a_different_sort_of_programming_instruction","310791972_Replication_in_computing_education_research_researcher_attitudes_and_experiences","269159195_Code_warriors_and_code-a-phobes","269136306_A_Pair_Programming_Trial_in_the_CS1_Lab","263849049_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","262393742_Learning_agile_software_engineering_practices_using_coding_dojo","242591347_Extreme_programming_explained_embrace_change_addison-wesley","240286088_Response_Style_and_Cross-Cultural_Comparisons_of_Rating_Scales_Among_East_Asian_and_North_American_Students","228883626_Factors_affecting_the_perceived_effectiveness_of_pair_programming_in_higher_education","228723941_Experiments_with_Industry's_Pair-Programming_Model_in_the_Computer_Science_Classroom","220807514_Student_attitudes_toward_pair_programming","220609488_Exploring_the_underlying_aspects_of_pair_programming_The_impact_of_personality","3841123_The_effects_of_pair-pressure_and_pair-learning_on_software_engineering_education","3247643_Strengthening_the_Case_for_Pair-Programming"]}
