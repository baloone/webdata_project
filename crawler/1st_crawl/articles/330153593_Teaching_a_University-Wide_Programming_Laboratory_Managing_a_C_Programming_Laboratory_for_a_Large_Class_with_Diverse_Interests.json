{"id":"330153593_Teaching_a_University-Wide_Programming_Laboratory_Managing_a_C_Programming_Laboratory_for_a_Large_Class_with_Diverse_Interests","abstract":"Programming is an essential and compulsory subject for all engineering and physical sciences undergraduate students in our institution. The teaching, in C, is covered through two subjects that are separately enrolled and assessed, but closely coordinated: one subject is lecture-based and the other is laboratory-only. The diverse interests, backgrounds, and previous experiences of over 700 students in each class constitute both a challenge and an opportunity for innovative teaching practices.\nThis paper describes experiences following recent changes in the organisation and management of the laboratory-based programming subject. The change to a less traditional organisation has reduced the number of failing students in the subject from over 100 in 2017 to just 14 in 2018.\nThe new arrangements provide a clearer recognition of the students' programming abilities through their grades in the programming laboratory subject, while allowing us to provide suitable challenges and enhanced programming skills to the students who already have significant computer and programming experiences from their school studies.","authors":["Vishv Mohan Malhotra","Ashish Anand"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1145/3286960.3286961","Conference: the Twenty-First Australasian Computing Education Conference"],"references":["322352077_Common_logic_errors_made_by_novice_programmers","322350359_Understanding_semantic_style_by_analysing_student_code","322343924_Intelligent_tutoring_systems_for_programming_education_a_systematic_review","312688996_Program_visualization_and_explanation_for_novice_C_programmers","266081141_A_Process_for_Novice_Programming_Using_Goals_and_Plans","262395985_Implementation_of_a_smart_lab_for_teachers_of_novice_programmers","262208722_Helping_first_year_novice_programming_students_PASS","235327467_What_vs_How_Comparing_Students'_Testing_and_Coding_Skills","228845352_A_people-first_approach_to_programming","220832184_An_Anti-Plagiarism_Editor_for_Software_Development_Courses","2840981_Winnowing_Local_Algorithms_for_Document_Fingerprinting","322343685_Learning_programming_syntax_errors_and_institution-specific_factors","305081966_Introductory_Programming_Let_Us_Cut_through_the_Clutter","294733933_How_Difficult_Are_Novice_Code_Writing_Tasks_A_Software_Metrics_Approach","263088328_It's_Not_Them_It's_Us_Why_Computer_Science_Fails_to_Impress_Many_First_Years"]}
