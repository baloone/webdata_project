{"id":"324159459_The_Problematic_Aspects_of_Cultural_Policy_in_Modern_Tuva","abstract":"The article is devoted to the analysis of the cultural politics in Tuva and is focused on the problematic aspects of its current development. It is the result of reflection on personal participation in the cultural policy making in the Tyva Republic, followed by the report and its subsequent discussion (within the Forum “Tuva of Future: Strategy for Change”, 28-30 June 2017, Kyzyl) through the application of historical-comparative, structural-typological and participant observation’s methods. According to the author, a major challenge for the development of culture industry of Tuva is that in the Soviet period it was the institutional model chosen for regional cultural development, while the region experiences the lack of human resources. Ethnic culture of the post-Soviet stage in the Tuvan history is characterized by the self-isolation concerning the value aspect. The implementation of the cluster institutional models and the effective use of the Tuva cultural brand, which is an eco-exo-ethnocultural synthesis, can contribute to the solution of the cultural policy problems. The research results can be applied in the development of concepts and Republican target programs of the Tuva cultural development. The prospect may be finding the optimal balance of conservative and innovative tendencies. The imbalance between ethnic culture and national culture in the contemporary cultural life of the Republic should be oriented towards the national (Russian) identity and its understanding.","authors":["Ekaterina K.
