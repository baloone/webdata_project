{"id":"344848735_Rage_against_the_machine_Incorporating_legal_tech_into_legal_education","abstract":"Technology is changing the way that legal services are delivered and is having an impact on the administration of justice. Law firms are increasingly adopting digital technologies to disrupt traditional ways of working. The emergence of new technologies test existing legal parameters, paradigms and concepts bringing about legal, ethical and societal challenges. Planned changes to the legal education and training for solicitors and barristers provide law schools with an opportunity to review their curricula.

This article explores the pedagogical challenges and opportunities afforded by engaging students in technologically enhanced learning.","authors":["Francine Ryan"],"meta":["September 2020The Law Teacher 55(3):1-13","DOI:10.1080/03069400.2020.1805927"],"references":[]}
