{"id":"271514745_RPL_IPv6_Routing_Protocol_for_Low_power_and_Lossy_Networks","abstract":"Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which\nboth the routers and their interconnect are constrained. LLN routers\ntypically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and\nenergy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by\nhigh loss rates, low data rates, and instability. LLNs are comprised\nof anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported\ntraffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the\nLLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset\nof devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices\ninside the LLN towards a central control point). This document\nspecifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks\n(RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic\nfrom devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well\nas point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the\ndevices inside the LLN are supp","authors":["Pascal Thubert","Tim Winter","Anders Brandt","Jonathan W.
