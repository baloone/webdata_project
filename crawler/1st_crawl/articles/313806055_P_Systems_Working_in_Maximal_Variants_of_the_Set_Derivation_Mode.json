{"id":"313806055_P_Systems_Working_in_Maximal_Variants_of_the_Set_Derivation_Mode","abstract":"In P systems working in the set derivation mode, even in the maximally parallel derivation mode, rules are only applied in at most one copy in each derivation step. We also consider the set mode in the cases of taking those sets of rules with the maximal number of applicable rules or with affecting the maximal number of objects. For many variants of P systems, the computational completeness proofs even literally still hold true for these new set derivation modes. On the other hand, we obtain new results for P systems using target selection for the rules to be chosen together with these set derivation modes.","authors":["Artiom Alhazov","Rudolf Freund","Sergey Verlan"],"meta":["February 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-54072-6_6","Conference: International Conference on Membrane Computing"],"references":["283277246_Flat_maximal_parallelism_in_P_systems_with_promoters","267675241_Sequential_P_Systems_with_Regular_Control","267664413_Fast_Hardware_Implementations_of_P_Systems","256441559_How_to_Obtain_Computational_Completeness_in_P_Systems_with_One_Catalyst","282433392_Small_Purely_Catalytic_P_Systems_Simulating_Register_Machines","273945962_P_Systems_with_Toxic_Objects","268054690_Regulated_rewriting_in_formel_language_theory","267104835_Further_results_on_P_systems_with_promotersinhibitors","265437708_Membrane_computing_14th_international_conference_CMC_2013_Chisinau_Republic_of_Moldova_August_20-23_2013_Revised_selected_papers","255671959_Ordered_Firing_in_Petri_Nets"]}
