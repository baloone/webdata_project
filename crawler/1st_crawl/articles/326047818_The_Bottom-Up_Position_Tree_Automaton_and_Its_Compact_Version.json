{"id":"326047818_The_Bottom-Up_Position_Tree_Automaton_and_Its_Compact_Version","abstract":"The conversion of a given regular tree expression into a tree automaton has been widely studied. However, classical interpretations are based upon a Top-Down interpretation of tree automata. In this paper, we propose a new construction based on Gluskovâ€™s one using a Bottom-Up interpretation. One of the main goals of this technique is to consider as a next step the links with deterministic recognizers, consideration that cannot be performed with classical Top-Down approaches. Furthermore, we exhibit a method to factorize transitions of tree automata and show that this technique is particularly interesting for the Glushkov constructions, by considering natural factorizations due to the structure of regular expression.","authors":["Samira Attou","Ludovic Mignot","Djelloul Ziadi"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-94812-6_6","In book: Implementation and Application of Automata (pp.59-70)","Project: Tree automata from regular expressions"],"references":["320745895_Tree_Automata_Constructions_from_Regular_Expressions_a_Comparative_Study","278048960_Bottom_Up_Quotients_and_Residuals_for_Tree_Languages","220976005_Schema_Evolution_for_XML_A_Consistency-Preserving_Approach","220165346_Construction_of_tree_automata_from_regular_expressions","265990523_From_Regular_Tree_Expression_to_Position_Tree_Automaton","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","223008371_One-Unambiguous_Regular_Languages","222734141_Partial_derivatives_of_regular_expressions_and_finite_automaton_constructions","222726809_Characterization_of_Glushkov_automata"]}
