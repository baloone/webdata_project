{"id":"340419532_A_multi-objective_approach_for_designing_optimized_operation_sequence_on_binary_image_processing","abstract":"In binary image segmentation, the choice of the order of the operation sequence may yield to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose to tackle the associated optimization problem via multi-objective approach. Given the original image, in combination with a list of morphological, logical and stacking operations, the goal is to obtain the ideal output at the lowest computational cost. We compared the performance of two Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs): the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2). NSGA-II has better results in most cases, but the difference does not reach statistical significance. The results show that the similarity measure and the computational cost are objective functions in conflict, while the number of operations available and type of input images impact on the quality of Pareto set.","authors":["Claudio Lezcano","Jose Luis Vazquez Noguera","Diego P.
