{"id":"307558016_Computational_Pan-Genomics_Status_Promises_and_Challenges","abstract":"Many disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant and animal breeding, microbiology and\nvirology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing numbers of genomes. In case of\nHomo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few\nyears. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be su�cient for leveraging the full\npotential of such rich genomic datasets. Instead, novel, qualitatively di�erent computational methods\nand paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a\nnew sub-area of research in computational biology. In this paper, we generalize existing de�nitions\nand understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to\nbe used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes,\ndiscuss the potential bene�ts of future technologies and methodologies, and review open challenges\nfrom the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for\na computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of\nreference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges\nfrom di�erent application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant\nbioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. In this way, we would like\nto bring forward a joint reference for researchers in related �elds so as to enhance synergy among them","authors":["The Computational Pan-Genomics Consortium"],"meta":["August 2016Briefings in Bioinformatics 19(1)","DOI:10.1093/bib/bbw089"],"references":["319667310_Analysis_of_the_genetic_phylogeny_of_multifocal_prostate_cancer_identifies_multiple_independent_clonal_expansions_in_neoplastic_and_morphologically_normal_prostate_tissue","309475967_Genome_assembly_using_Nanopore-guided_Long_and_Error-free_DNA_reads","307545963_PanTools_representation_storage_and_exploration_of_pan-genomic_data","306293575_Analysis_of_protein-coding_genetic_variation_in_60706_humans","322567786_Analysis_of_protein-coding_genetic_variation_in_60706_humans","313050600_Life_with_6000_genes","311219636_Read_mapping_on_de_Bruijn_graphs","309347571_Quest_for_Orthologs_QfO_entails_Quest_for_Tree_of_Life_QfToL_In_search_of_the_gene_stream","306921985_Transcript-level_expression_analysis_of_RNA-seq_experiments_with_HISAT_StringTie_and_Ballgown","306157516_Initial_sequencing_and_analysis_of_the_human_genome"]}
