{"id":"283571440_Absolute_key_variation_technique_of_automatic_variable_key_in_cryptography","abstract":"Rapid development of computer networks laid a trend to share the information worldwide. However, one of the important criterions is to provide the confidentiality to the shared data over the insecure communication channel. Due to the growth of computer technology; assuring the security of such shared information becomes challenging and complicated task among the researchers. In this consequence, the dynamic key approach is most desirable as compared to static key. In this respect, the AVK is one of the best techniques to achieve the perfect security as per the literature. In this paper, we have proposed a dynamic mechanism of AVK to enhance the security by increasing the randomness among the successive keys.","authors":["Rajat Subhra Goswami","Subhasish Banerjee","Manash Pratim Dutta","Chandan Bhunia"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1145/2799979.2800021","Conference: Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks"],"references":["2625740_A_High-speed_DES_Implementation_for_Network_Applications","317172040_A_New_Three_Dimensional_Based_Key_Generation_Technique_in_AVK","305801381_A_Novel_Approach_to_Achieve_the_Perfect_Security_through_AVK_over_Insecure_Communication_Channel","301720790_Generation_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_to_Make_Secure_Communication","283571353_Two_New_Schemes_to_Generate_Automatic_Variable_Key_AVK_to_achieve_the_Perfect_Security_in_Insecure_Communication_Channel","272010140_New_Techniques_for_Generating_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_in_Achieving_Perfect_Security","263578074_Generation_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_under_Various_Approaches_in_Cryptography_System","261851889_New_Approach_towards_Generation_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_to_Achieve_Perfect_Security","242101903_A_novel_approach_towards_realizing_optimum_data_transfer_and_Automatic_Variable_KeyAVK_in_cryptography","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","228965482_Application_of_avk_and_selective_encryption_in_improving_performance_of_quantum_cryptography_and_networks","220411114_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","200034020_Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","13771413_Communication_theory_of_secrecy_systems_1945","2957223_Special_Feature_Exhaustive_Cryptanalysis_of_the_NBS_Data_Encryption_Standard","2416974_A_Fast_New_DES_Implementation_in_Software"]}
