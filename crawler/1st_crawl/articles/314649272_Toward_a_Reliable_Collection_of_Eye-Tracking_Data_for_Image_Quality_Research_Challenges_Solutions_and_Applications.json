{"id":"314649272_Toward_a_Reliable_Collection_of_Eye-Tracking_Data_for_Image_Quality_Research_Challenges_Solutions_and_Applications","abstract":"Image quality assessment potentially benefits from the addition of visual attention. However, incorporating aspects of visual attention in image quality models by means of a perceptually optimised strategy is largely unexplored. Fundamental challenges such as how visual attention is affected by the concurrence of visual signals and their distortions; whether visual attention affected by distortion or that driven by the original scene only should be included in an image quality model; and how to select visual attention models for the image quality application context remain. To shed light on the above unsolved issues, designing and performing eye-tracking experiments are essential. Collecting eye-tracking data for the purpose of image quality study is so far confronted with a bias due to the involvement of stimulus repetition. In this paper, we propose a new experimental methodology to eliminate such inherent bias. This allows obtaining reliable eye-tracking data with a large degree of stimulus variability. In fact, we first conducted 5760 eye movement trials that included 160 human observers freely viewing 288 images of varying quality. We then made use of the resulting eye-tracking data to provide insights into the optimal use of visual attention in image quality research. The new eye-tracking data are made publicly available to the research community.","authors":["Wei Zhang","Hantao Liu"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2017.2681424"],"references":["286573022_Influence_of_compression_artifacts_on_visual_attention","271554907_Memorability_of_natural_scenes_The_role_of_attention","268689513_Salient_Object_Detection_A_Survey","258791980_How_Does_Image_Content_Affect_the_Added_Value_of_Visual_Attention_in_Objective_Image_Quality_Assessment","258547363_Interactions_of_visual_attention_and_quality_perception","257574077_Saliency_and_Human_Fixations_State-of-the-Art_and_Study_of_Comparison_Metrics","233799230_A_Comparative_Study_of_Fixation_Density_Maps","228616958_The_35th_Sir_Frederick_Bartlett_lecture_Eye_movements_and_attention_in_reading_scene_perception_and_visual_search","228576068_Unveiling_relationships_between_regions_of_interest_and_image_fidelity_metrics","226953543_The_role_of_visual_attention_in_saccadic_eye_movements","225714505_Failure_to_Detect_Changes_to_Attended_Objects_in_Motion_Pictures","225053817_Saliency_Detection_in_the_Compressed_Domain_for_Adaptive_Image_Retargeting","224258668_Applications_of_Objective_Image_Quality_Assessment_Methods","224253540_Eye-Tracking_Database_for_a_Set_of_Standard_Video_Sequences","224115032_How_to_apply_spatial_saliency_into_objective_metrics_for_JPEG_compressed_images","224057925_Blind_Quality_Metric_using_a_Perceptual_Importance_Map_for_JPEG-20000_Compressed_Images","220929638_Image_quality_assessment_with_visual_attention","47793931_Li_Q_Information_content_weighting_for_perceptual_image_quality_assessment_IEEE_Image_Proc_205_1185-1198","47156165_Variability_of_eye_movements_when_viewing_dynamic_natural_scenes","21654601_Temporary_Suppression_of_Visual_Processing_in_an_RSVP_Task_An_Attentional_Blink","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","308871273_The_quest_for_the_integration_of_visual_saliency_models_in_objective_image_quality_assessment_A_distraction_power_compensated_combination_strategy","281054670_The_Application_of_Visual_Saliency_Models_in_Objective_Image_Quality_Assessment_A_Statistical_Evaluation","278725454_Overt_visual_attention_for_free-viewing_and_quality_assessment_tasks","262282856_Salient_Object_Detection_A_Benchmark","261465800_Overview_of_Eye_tracking_Datasets","248340477_Visual_Attention_and_Eye_Movement_Control_During_Reading_and_Picture_Viewing","245928948_Digital_Images_and_Human_Vision","238522991_Visual_Attention_in_Quality_Assessment","236121001_The_Visible_Differences_Predictor_An_Algorithm_for_the_Assessment_of_Image_Fidelity","234815593_The_use_of_psychophysical_data_and_models_in_the_analysis_of_display_system_performance","230675507_Foundations_of_Vision","230622951_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Human-Model_Agreement_in_Visual_Saliency_Modeling_A_Comparative_Study","229068368_Between-_or_within-subjects_designs_A_methodological_dilemma","228349258_A_no-reference_blocking_artifact_measure_for_adaptive_video_processing","227178280_Learning_visual_saliency_by_combining_feature_maps_in_a_nonlinear_manner_using_AdaBoost","224393835_A_No-Reference_Objective_Image_Sharpness_Metric_Based_on_the_Notion_of_Just_Noticeable_Blur_JNB","224359520_Can_visual_fixation_patterns_improve_image_fidelity_assessment","224359518_Saliency_based_objective_quality_assessment_of_decoded_video_affected_by_packet_losses","224359053_A_no-reference_perceptual_image_sharpness_metric_based_on_saliency-weighted_foveal_pooling","224226765_Visual_Attention_in_Objective_Image_Quality_Assessment_Based_on_Eye-Tracking_Data","224216147_FSIM_A_Feature_SIMilarity_index_for_image_quality_assessment","224216029_Visual_fixation_patterns_in_subjective_quality_assessment_The_relative_impact_of_image_content_and_structural_distortions","224159693_Visual_saliency_detection_in_image_using_ant_colony_optimisation_and_local_phase_coherence","222864111_Modeling_Visual_Attention_via_Selective_Tuning","220962350_Image_Quality_Assessment_Complemented_with_Visual_Regions_of_Interest","220696178_Modern_Image_Quality_Assessment","220307131_Overt_visual_attention_for_free-viewing_and_quality_assessment_tasks_Impact_of_the_regions_of_interest_on_a_video_quality_metric","51075777_Fixations_on_Low_Resolution_Images","19586578_Mechanisms_of_visual_attention_revealed_by_saccadic_eye_movements","15546960_The_role_of_visual_attention_in_saccadic_eye_movements","12024017_Treue_S_Neural_correlates_of_attention_in_primate_visual_cortex_Trends_Neurosci_24_295-300","11804110_Visibility_of_Wavelet_Quantization_Noise","10919118_Eye_movements_of_large_populations_II_Deriving_regions_of_interest_coverage_and_similarity_using_fixation_maps","8253693_Automatic_Foveation_for_Video_Compression_Using_a_Neurobiological_Model_of_Visual_Attention"]}
