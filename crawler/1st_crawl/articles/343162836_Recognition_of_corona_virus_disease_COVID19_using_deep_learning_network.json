{"id":"343162836_Recognition_of_corona_virus_disease_COVID19_using_deep_learning_network","abstract":"Corona virus disease (COVID19) has an incredible influence in the last few months. It causes thousands of deaths in round the world. This make a rapid research movement to deal with this new virus. As a computer science, many technical researches have been done to tackle with it by using image processing algorithms. In this work, we introduce a method based on deep learning networks to classify COVID19 based on x-ray images. Our results are encouraging to rely on to classify the infected people from the normal. We conduct our experiments on recent dataset, Kaggle dataset of COVID19 X-ray images and using ResNet50 deep learning network with 5 and 10 folds cross validation. The experiments results show that 5 folds gives effective results than 10 folds with accuracy rate 97.28%.","authors":["Ashwan Abdulmunem","Zinah Abdulridha Abutiheen","Hiba J.
