{"id":"299670644_Functional_Video_Games_in_CS1_II","abstract":"This article advocates that developing distributed multiplayer video games using functional programming should be a new trend in the CS1 classroom. This is premised on two facts: most students are excited by video game development and distributed programming is now common and not beyond the abilities of beginning students. A design recipe for the development of distributed applications is presented which has successfully been used at Seton Hall University over the past few semesters. The primary goal is to expose students to distributed programming and to have students think about some of the problems programmers face when writing distributed applications. To the CS1 instructor, this article presents a model for developing their own distributed programming module.","authors":["Marco T.
