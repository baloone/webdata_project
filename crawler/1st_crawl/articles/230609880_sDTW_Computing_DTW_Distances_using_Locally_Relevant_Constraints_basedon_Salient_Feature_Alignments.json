{"id":"230609880_sDTW_Computing_DTW_Distances_using_Locally_Relevant_Constraints_basedon_Salient_Feature_Alignments","abstract":"Many applications generate and consume temporal data and retrieval of time\nseries is a key processing step in many application domains. Dynamic time\nwarping (DTW) distance between time series of size N and M is computed relying\non a dynamic programming approach which creates and fills an NxM grid to search\nfor an optimal warp path. Since this can be costly, various heuristics have\nbeen proposed to cut away the potentially unproductive portions of the DTW\ngrid. In this paper, we argue that time series often carry structural features\nthat can be used for identifying locally relevant constraints to eliminate\nredundant work. Relying on this observation, we propose salient feature based\nsDTW algorithms which first identify robust salient features in the given time\nseries and then find a consistent alignment of these to establish the\nboundaries for the warp path search. More specifically, we propose alternative\nfixed core&adaptive width, adaptive core&fixed width, and adaptive\ncore&adaptive width strategies which enforce different constraints reflecting\nthe high level structural characteristics of the series in the data set.\nExperiment results show that the proposed sDTW algorithms help achieve much\nhigher accuracy in DTWcomputation and time series retrieval than fixed core &\nfixed width algorithms that do not leverage local features of the given time\nseries.","authors":["K.
