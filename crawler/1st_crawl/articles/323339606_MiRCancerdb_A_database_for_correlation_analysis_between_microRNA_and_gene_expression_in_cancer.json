{"id":"323339606_MiRCancerdb_A_database_for_correlation_analysis_between_microRNA_and_gene_expression_in_cancer","abstract":"Objectives: \nmicroRNAs regulate expression of target genes by specifically binding to their transcripts, subsequently leading to translational inhibition or mRNA degradation. Gene regulation by microRNAs has been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we leverage the use of public-access data and the available genomic annotations to pre-calculate the correlation of the expression of a large number of microRNAs with gene at the mRNA and protein level in the context of cancers.\n\nResults: \nExpression data of miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins in cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas along with TargetScan miRNAs-target annotations were used to calculate the expression correlations between miRNAs and features (mRNAs/proteins) in a number of cancer studies. We then packed the output of this analysis into a database and made it available through an interactive web application. The miRCancerdb is an easy-to-use database to investigate the microRNAs-dependent regulation of target genes involved in development of cancer.","authors":["Mahmoud Ahmed","Huynh Quoc Nguyen","Trang Huyen Lai","Deok Ryong Kim"],"meta":["December 2018BMC Research Notes 11(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13104-018-3160-9","Project: Tools for studying gene expression and regulation"],"references":["223997089_International_network_of_cancer_genome_projects","51588237_Cistrome_An_integrative_platform_for_transcriptional_regulation_studies","51201216_Thomson_DW_Bracken_CP_and_Goodall_GJ_Experimental_strategies_for_microRNA_target_identification_Nucleic_Acids_Res_39_6845-6853","8047566_Microarray_analysis_shows_that_some_microRNAs_downregulate_large_numbers_of_target_mRNAs","7797125_MicroRNA_expression_profiles_classify_human_cancers","5804605_A_biochemical_approach_to_identifying_microRNA_targets","263892315_MicroRNAs_in_cancer_Biomarkers_functions_and_therapy","240226239_MicroRNAs_Small_RNAs_with_a_big_role_in_gene_regulation","234158169_MiRCancer_A_microRNA-cancer_association_database_constructed_by_text_mining_on_literature","6226296_MicroRNA_Targeting_Specificity_in_Mammals_Determinants_Beyond_Seed_Pairing"]}
