{"id":"318133891_Improving_Video_Engagement_by_Gamification_A_Proposed_Design_of_MOOC_Videos","abstract":"MOOCs have rapidly been a predominant form of distance learning recently. Through high-speed internet, students in MOOCs can not only enjoy best learning resources around the world, but also connect closely with others. However, it is worrying that completion rate of MOOCs is only 10% on average, which reflects the low engagement of learning in MOOCs. Confronted with such problem, this paper proposed a gamification design of MOOC videos by adding implicit feedback into mechanics and updating existing delivery media from lecture-style to narrative-style.","authors":["Yun Zhu","Leisi Pei","Junjie Shang"],"meta":["May 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-59360-9_38","Conference: International Conference on Blended Learning"],"references":["322918575_An_Analysis_of_Video_Lecture_in_MOOC","311879391_How_gamification_motivates_An_experimental_study_of_the_effects_of_specific_game_design_elements_on_psychological_need_satisfaction","310773130_Handbook_of_Student_Engagement","303018696_Gamification_Toward_a_definition","299576174_Exploring_the_factors_affecting_MOOC_retention_A_survey_study","286690038_Making_Sense_of_MOOCs_Musings_in_a_Maze_of_Myth_Paradox_and_Possibility","282975208_Motivation_to_Participate_in_an_Online_Citizen_Science_Game_A_Study_of_Foldit","282185096_How_Video_Usage_Styles_Affect_Student_Engagement_Implications_for_Video-Based_Learning_Environments","282017068_MOOCs_A_Systematic_Study_of_the_Published_Literature_2008-2012","274731676_Will_MOOCs_transform_learning_and_teaching_in_higher_education_Engagement_and_course_retention_in_online_learning_provision","273947177_Gamification_Toward_a_definition","271669519_Understanding_MOOCs_as_an_Emerging_Online_Learning_Tool_Perspectives_From_the_Students","269936923_Promoting_engagement_in_online_courses_What_strategies_can_we_learn_from_three_highly_rated_MOOCS_Engagement_lessons_from_MOOCs","269692548_Psychological_Theory_and_the_Gamification_of_Learning","267453244_MOOCs_a_Systematic_Study_of_the_Published_Literature_2008-2012","262641471_Students'_and_Instructors'_Use_of_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOCs_Motivations_and_Challenges","262393281_How_video_production_affects_student_engagement_An_empirical_study_of_MOOC_videos","261178375_Visualizing_Patterns_of_Student_Engagement_and_Performance_in_MOOCs","260316869_Initial_Trends_in_Enrolment_and_Completion_of_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","237091973_Studying_Learning_in_the_Worldwide_Classroom_Research_into_edX's_First_MOOC","228884866_MDA_A_Formal_Approach_to_Game_Design_and_Game_Research","331925958_An_Introduction_to_Narratology_Trans_Patricia_Hausler-Greenfield_and_Monika_Fludernik","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","298546690_German_narratology_1_Introduction","292356090_Flow_and_the_foundations_of_positive_psychology_The_collected_works_of_Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi","291179856_Cognitive_engagement_in_the_Mathematics_Classroom","291126240_An_Analysis_of_Video_Lecture_in_MOOC","289963001_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Motivations_Classic_Definition_and_New_Directions","278666258_Handbook_of_Research_on_Student_Engagement","278649796_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Gamification_Measurement","273946846_The_Cambridge_Introduction_to_Narrative","273946762_The_Cambridge_Introduction_to_Narrative","271297691_Towards_a_Model_of_Engaging_Online_Students_Lessons_from_MOOCs_and_Four_Policy_Documents","249747546_The_Ethical_Implications_of_the_Five-Stage_Skill-Acquisition_Model","234793788_What_makes_things_fun_to_learn_Heuristics_for_designing_instructional_computer_games"]}
