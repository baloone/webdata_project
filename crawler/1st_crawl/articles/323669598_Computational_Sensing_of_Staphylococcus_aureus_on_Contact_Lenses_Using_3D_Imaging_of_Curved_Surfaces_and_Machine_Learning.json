{"id":"323669598_Computational_Sensing_of_Staphylococcus_aureus_on_Contact_Lenses_Using_3D_Imaging_of_Curved_Surfaces_and_Machine_Learning","abstract":"We present a cost-effective and portable platform based on contact lenses for non-invasively detecting Staphylococcus aureus, which is part of the human ocular microbiome and resides on the cornea and conjunctiva. Using Staphylococcus aureus-specific antibodies and a surface chemistry protocol that is compatible with human tear, contact lenses are designed to specifically capture Staphylococcus aureus. After the bacteria capture on the lens, and right before its imaging, the captured bacteria are tagged with surface-functionalized polystyrene microparticles. These microbeads provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for the quantification of the captured bacteria on the contact lens, without any fluorescent labels, by 3D imaging of the curved surface of each lens using only one hologram taken with a lensfree on-chip microscope. After the 3D surface of the contact lens is computationally reconstructed using rotational field transformations and holographic digital focusing, a machine learning algorithm is employed to automatically count the number of beads on the lens surface, revealing the count of the captured bacteria. To demonstrate its proof-of-concept, we created a field-portable and cost-effective holographic microscope, which weighs 77 g, controlled by a laptop. Using daily contact lenses that are spiked with bacteria, we demonstrated that this computational sensing platform provides a detection limit of ~16 bacteria/μL. This contact lens–based wearable sensor can be broadly applicable to detect various bacteria, viruses and analytes in tear using a cost-effective and portable computational imager that might be used even at home by consumers.","authors":["Muhammed Veli","Aydogan Ozcan"],"meta":["March 2018ACS Nano 12(3)","DOI:10.1021/acsnano.7b08375"],"references":["319988933_Edge_sparsity_criterion_for_robust_holographic_autofocusing","319606098_Air_quality_monitoring_using_mobile_microscopy_and_machine_learning","293168347_Comparing_Apples_and_Oranges_Next_Generation_Sequencing_and_Its_Impact_on_Microbiome_Analysis","287815715_Tools_for_the_Microbiome_Nano_and_Beyond","277975362_Staphylococcus_aureus_Infections_Epidemiology_Pathophysiology_Clinical_Manifestations_and_Management","272161283_The_human_microbiome_project_exploring_the_microbial_part_of_ourselves_in_a_changing_world","268230308_Reagent_and_laboratory_contamination_can_critically_impact_sequence-based_microbiome_analyses","264464156_Refocusing_criterion_via_sparsity_measurements_in_digital_holography","232324835_Simultaneous_Optical_Manipulation_3-D_Tracking_and_Imaging_of_Micro-Objects_by_Digital_Holography_in_Microfluidics","230768932_Imaging_without_lenses_Achievements_and_remaining_challenges_of_wide-field_on-chip_microscopy","225308983_The_Human_Microbiome_Project_HMP_Consortium_Structure_function_and_diversity_of_the_healthy_human_microbiome_Nature_486_207-214","51126232_Diversity_of_Bacteria_at_Healthy_Human_Conjunctiva","44576474_Lensfree_microscopy_on_a_cellphone","40484098_Creating_an_extended_focus_image_of_a_tilted_object_in_Fourier_digital_holography","26813916_Controlling_depth_of_focus_in_3D_image_reconstructions_by_flexible_and_adaptive_deformation_of_digital_holograms","26684529_The_role_of_microbial_flora_on_the_ocular_surface","21094704_Quantitative_alterations_of_the_commensal_eye_flora_in_contact_lens_wear","5257936_Formulation_of_the_rotational_transformation_of_wave_fields_and_their_application_to_digital_holography","308600333_Rapid_portable_and_cost-effective_yeast_cell_viability_and_concentration_analysis_using_lensfree_on-chip_microscopy_and_machine_learning","305363366_Lensless_Imaging_and_Sensing","301686786_Staphylococcus_aureus_The_current_state_of_disease_pathophysiology_and_strategies_for_prevention","284204758_Recent_advances_in_holographic_3D_particle_tracking","283323832_Surface-Engineered_Contact_Lens_as_an_Advanced_Theranostic_Platform_for_Modulation_and_Detection_of_Viral_Infection","269766726_Wide-field_computational_imaging_of_pathology_slides_using_lens-free_on-chip_microscopy","241697129_Characterization_of_the_normal_microbiota_of_the_ocular_surface","236113693_On-Chip_Biomedical_Imaging","235243349_Fuzzy_Nanassemblies_Toward_Layered_Polymeric_Multicomposites","225286456_The_Microbiome_of_the_Lung","11584162_16S_rRNA_Gene_Sequencing_for_Bacterial_Pathogen_Identification_in_the_Clinical_Laboratory","6513020_The_influence_of_surface_treatment_on_hydrophobicity_protein_adsorption_and_microbial_colonisation_of_silicone_hydrogel_contact_lenses"]}
