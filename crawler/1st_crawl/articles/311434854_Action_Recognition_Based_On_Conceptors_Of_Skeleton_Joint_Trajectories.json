{"id":"311434854_Action_Recognition_Based_On_Conceptors_Of_Skeleton_Joint_Trajectories","abstract":"With the tremendous popularity of the Kinect, recognizing human actions or gestures from skeletal data becomes more feasible. Skeletal data is a more exact data than RGB video while it eliminates the occlusions that caused by the limbs of the actor. Previous neural network based approaches recognize actions by learning spatial-temporal features. However, nobody can explain what are those features represent. Different from them, we propose a novel action recognition framework based on conceptors of skeleton joint trajectories. Conceptor is a mechanism of neurodynamical organization. We compute conceptor for the trajectory of each dimension of the skeleton joint, and use the singular value vector to represent the trajectory. Then, we encode singular value vectors as binary vectors by using a clustering method. At last, we use softmax regression to recognize the trajectory codes. This is a novel framework which recognizes actions using the conceptual level information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the efficiency of this framework.","authors":["J.
