Software concept in big\ndata regard to cloud deployment involve three main layers are\ndata layers (sources data), data aggregation, and analytics layer.\nIn this research we proposed development references architecture\nwhich indicates the processes through life data cycle, cloud\n(SaaS,PaaS, and IaaS), and analytics layer. The preprocess and\nacquisition process drive interlinking among layers and provide\nthe validate process.","authors":["Wael AL-zyadat","Aysh Alhroob"],"meta":["May 2019International Journal of Advanced Technology and Engineering Exploration 8(1C2):884-887","Conference: International Conference on Multidisciplinary Research and Innovation ICMRI 2019Volume: 8","Project: Big Data coherence with KDD"],"references":["281576313_The_Anatomy_of_Big_Data_Computing","272946686_Significance_and_Challenges_of_Big_Data_Research","272027871_Reference_Architecture_and_Classification_of_Technologies_Products_and_Services_for_Big_Data_Systems","270276259_How_'big_data'_can_make_big_impact_Findings_from_a_systematic_review_and_a_longitudinal_case_study","220168977_Ordering_Systems_Coordinative_Practices_and_Artifacts_in_Architectural_Design_and_Planning","329286486_A_very_personal_35_years_long_journey_in_ESR_dating","322016253_A_Systematic_Review_of_Big_Data_Analytics_Using_Model_Driven_Engineering","303325741_Towards_a_model-driven_design_tool_for_big_data_architectures","295920015_Big_data_analytics_Understanding_its_capabilities_and_potential_benefits_for_healthcare_organizations"]}
