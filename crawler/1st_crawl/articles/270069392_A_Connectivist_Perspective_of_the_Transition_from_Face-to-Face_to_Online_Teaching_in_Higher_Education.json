{"id":"270069392_A_Connectivist_Perspective_of_the_Transition_from_Face-to-Face_to_Online_Teaching_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"Existing research shows a slow transition to online education by many university teaching staff. A mixed methods approach is used to survey teacher educators in three jurisdictions in the UK who have made the transition to online teaching, followed by focus group and individual interviews to triangulate the data. The eight tenets of connectivism are used as a lens for analysis. Findings reveal sound pedagogical reasons for the limited choice of online tools and tutors highlight two elements, namely, self-fulfilment and their desire to continually develop as an educator, as the rationale for adopting informal professional development in the 21st century.","authors":["Pamela Cowan"],"meta":["March 2013International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 8(1)","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v8i1.2346"],"references":["354851884_Distance_Education_Technology_Higher_Education_Barriers_During_the_First_Decade_of_the_Twenty-First_Century","320194879_Digital_technologies_and_their_role_in_achieving_our_ambitions_for_education","277125392_Supporting_Online_Faculty_-_Revisiting_the_Seven_Principles_A_Few_Years_Later","266351544_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Active_Learning_and_an_Alternative_Pedagogical_Framework_for_Introductory_Information_Systems_Courses","348866237_Evaluating_e-Learning_Guiding_Research_and_Practice","288467056_Social_Learning_Theory","258208998_Distance_Learning_Making_Connections_Across_Virtual_Space_and_Time","246255758_From_Sage_on_the_Stage_to_Guide_on_the_Side","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","238661921_Preparing_Instructors_for_Quality_Online_Instruction"]}
