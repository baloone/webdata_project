{"id":"308756893_Reliability_of_Complete_Cubic_Networks_under_the_Condition_of_g_-Good-Neighbor","abstract":"Fault tolerance is the ability such that a multiprocessor system operates properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. Latifi et al. [IEEE Trans. Comput. 43 (2) (1994) 218–222] proposed the notion of Rg-connectivity ( κ g ) (κg) of a network modeled by graph G such that at least κ g κg vertices in G should be deleted to disconnect the network, and the minimum degree of every connected component is at least g. This paper establishes κ g ( CCN ( n ) ) = ( n − g + 1 ) 2 g κg(CCN(n))=(n−g+1)2g ( 1 ≤ g ≤ n − 2 ) (1≤g≤n−2) for n-dimensional complete cubic network CCN ( n ) CCN(n). Fault diagnosability is another important metric for evaluating network reliability and availability. In 2012, Peng et al. [Appl. Math. Comput. 218 (21) (2012) 10406–10412] proposed a novel g-good-neighbor (conditional) diagnosability, which tacitly assumes that every fault-free vertex has at least g fault-free neighbors. In view of κ g ( CCN ( n ) ) κg(CCN(n)), we show that the g-good-neighbor diagnosability of the complete cubic network CCN(n) under the PMC model ( 1 ≤ g ≤ n − 2 1≤g≤n−2) and the MM* model ( 1 ≤ g ≤ n − 2 1≤g≤n−2 and n ≥ 4 n≥4) is ( n − g + 2 ) 2 g − 1 (n−g+2)2g−1, respectively.","authors":["Xiang Xu","Shuming Zhou","Jinqiang Li"],"meta":["September 2016The Computer Journal 60(5)","DOI:10.1093/comjnl/bxw078"],"references":["284142960_A_comparison_connection_assignment_for_self-diagnosis_of_multiprocessor_systems","273523144_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model_and_MM_Model","256308161_Node-to-Set_Disjoint-Path_Routing_in_Hierarchical_Cubic_Networks","220771266_A_Comparison_Connection_Assignment_for_Diagnosis_of_Multiprocessor_Systems","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","3043255_Conditional_Connectivity_Measures_for_Large_Multiprocessor_Systems","319259354_On_fault_tolerance_of_n_k_-star_networks","307519130_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","301248292_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","299344525_The_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","295254875_G-Good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_3-ary_n-cube_networks","284084353_On_conditional_fault_tolerance_and_diagnosability_of_hierarchical_cubic_networks","284026393_On_conditional_edge-connectivity_of_graphs","283790881_Connectivity_Results_of_Complete_Cubic_Networks_as_Associated_with_Linearly_Many_Faults","282841129_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Burnt_Pancake_Networks_Under_the_PMC_Model","267506801_Fault-tolerance_of_-star_networks","261222902_The_decycling_problem_in_hierarchical_cubic_networks","260411228_Generalized_measures_for_fault_tolerance_of_star_networks","229530874_Conditional_connectivity","228778603_Node-Disjoint_Paths_and_Related_Problems_on_Hierarchical_Cubic_Networks","223097960_Topological_properties_of_hierarchical_cubic_networks","222767739_On_Computing_a_Conditional_Edge-Connectivity_of_a_Graph","221132175_The_Diagnosability_of_g-good-neighbor_Conditional-Faulty_Hypercube_under_PMC_Model","220543647_Hamiltonicity_of_the_Hierarchical_Cubic_Network","220458523_On_Detecting_Multiple_Faults_in_Baseline_Interconnection_Networks","220236667_The_Optimal_Routing_Algorithm_in_Hierarchical_Cubic_Network_and_Its_Properties","220209179_Fault-Tolerant_Cycle_Embedding_in_Hierarchical_Cubic_Networks","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3300240_Comments_on_Hierarchical_cubic_networks","3299902_Hierarchical_cubic_networks","3299703_Generalized_Measures_of_Fault_Tolerance_in_n-Cube_Networks","3043034_On_Self-Diagnosable_Multiprocessor_Systems_Diagnosis_by_the_Comparison_Approach"]}
