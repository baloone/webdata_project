{"id":"319643134_The_representation-ring-graded_local_cohomology_spectral_sequence_for_BPR3","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to examine the calculational consequences of the duality for BPR proved by the first author and Meier in 1607.02332, making them explicit in the special case n=3. We give an explicit description of the behaviour of the spectral sequence, with pictures.","authors":["JPC Greenlees","Dae-Woong Lee"],"meta":["September 2017Communications in Algebra 47(6)","DOI:10.1080/00927872.2018.1427253"],"references":["317205148_Four_approaches_to_cohomology_theories_with_reality","305119517_Gorenstein_duality_for_Real_spectra","290263503_Homotopy_Invariant_Commutative_Algebra_over_fields","45869076_On_the_non-existence_of_elements_of_Kervaire_invariant_one","325456359_Four_approaches_to_cohomology_theories_with_reality","324127320_Homotopy_Invariant_Commutative_Algebra_over_Fields","319119464_The_C2-spectrum_Tmf13_and_its_invertible_modules","266293748_Pontrjagin_Duality_for_Generalized_Homology_and_Cohomology_Theories","266012498_The_Connective_K-Theory_of_Finite_Groups","265431719_Rings_modules_and_algebras_in_stable_homotopy_theory_With_an_appendix_by_M_Cole","265328290_K-theory_and_reality","263137145_Real-oriented_homotopy_theory_and_an_analogue_of_the_Adams-Novikov_spectral_sequence","254888670_Conjugations_on_Complex_Manifolds_and_Equivariant_Homotopy_of_Mu","246084807_Equivariant_K-theory_and_completion","245888251_Rings_with_a_local_cohomology_theorem_and_applications_to_cohomology_rings_of_groups","238852097_K-homology_of_universal_spaces_and_local_cohomology_of_the_representation_ring","222492072_Commutative_algebra_in_group_cohomology","222421920_Duality_in_algebra_and_topology","2106433_An_Atiyah-Hirzebruch_Spectral_Sequence_for_K_R-Theory","2104489_On_Real-oriented_Johnson-Wilson_cohomology"]}
