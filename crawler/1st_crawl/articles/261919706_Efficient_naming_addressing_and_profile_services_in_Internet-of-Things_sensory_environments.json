{"id":"261919706_Efficient_naming_addressing_and_profile_services_in_Internet-of-Things_sensory_environments","abstract":"We present a naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS) as a middleware to bridge different platforms in Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensory environments. Given massive amount of heterogeneous devices deployed across different platforms, NAPS serves as the key module at the back-end data center to aid the efficient upstream sensory data collection, content-based data filtering and matching, and downstream efficient control by applications. While previous research efforts only focus on a specific standard or protocol, we aim to design a middleware component servicing dynamic application needs, and sensors/actuators deployment and configurations across different platforms. Specifically, we propose a complete design of NAPS, including its key functionalities, system flows, interfaces, and individual module design. We further propose a unique device naming and addressing convention, and show its applicability to a few widely-used standards and protocols. We also propose an efficient identifier generation scheme; and we demonstrate a full implementation of the above designs with a case study, including a service registration portal. Finally, performance evaluation is done against the system throughput.","authors":["Chi Harold Liu","Bo Yang","Tiancheng Liu"],"meta":["July 2014Ad Hoc Networks 18:85â€“101","DOI:10.1016/j.adhoc.2013.02.008"],"references":["224372753_Dynamic_Huffman_addressing_in_wireless_sensor_networks_based_on_the_energy_map","224208795_A_resource_oriented_architecture_for_the_Web_of_Things","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","221601279_A_Middleware_for_Intelligent_Environments_and_the_Internet_of_Things","221036920_Architecture_and_protocols_for_the_Internet_of_Things_A_case_study","4109021_An_energy-efficient_node_address_naming_scheme_for_wireless_sensor_networks","3958459_Detecting_SYN_flooding_attacks","3335053_Defending_Against_Distributed_Denial-of-Service_Attacks_with_Max-Min_Fair_Server-Centric_Router_Throttles","278777402_The_internet_of_things_concept_and_problem_statement_03","261225932_Two-tier_dynamic_address_assignment_in_wireless_sensor_networks","242529301_Network_Ingress_Filtering_Defeating_Denial_of_Service_Attacks_Which_Employ_IP_Source_Address_Spoofing","235642082_Internet_of_Things_Vision_Applications_and_Research_Challenges","224700907_Addressing_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Short_Survey","224610226_A_Survey_of_Addressing_Algorithms_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222756766_Architecture_design_and_performance_evaluation_of_RFID_object_tracking_systems","221631641_Developing_network_software_and_communications_protocols_towards_the_internet_of_things","220832136_Beacon_Vector_Routing_Scalable_Point-to-Point_Routing_in_Wireless_Sensornets","220762278_Distributed_hash_table_based_ID_management_optimization_for_internet_of_things","220213531_Combining_heterogeneous_service_technologies_for_building_an_Internet_of_Things_middleware","216797523_Architectural_Styles_and_the_Design_of_Network-based_Software_Architectures","3895317_Random_Ephemeral_Transaction_Identifiers_in_dynamic_sensor_networks","3199392_Tracing_cyber_attacks_from_the_practical_perspective","2548180_Distributed_Assignment_of_Encoded_MAC_Addresses_in_Sensor_Networks","2489794_Implementing_Pushback_Router-Based_Defense_Against_DDoS_Attacks","2380771_Building_Efficient_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_with_Low-Level_Naming"]}
