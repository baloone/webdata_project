{"id":"222461357_Static_analysis_of_life_and_death_in_the_game_of_Go","abstract":"This paper describes heuristic rules for static life/death analysis for general classes of groups in the game of Go, as implemented in authors’ world championship computer Go programs Go Intellect and HandTalk. We shall show that for many life and death problems in Go, the effect of a tree search can be approximated by a static analysis on the group’s interior and surroundings. We investigate eye-spaces with or without opponent’s dead stones and try to provide a foundation towards conquering the combinatorial explosion of Go game tree.","authors":["Ken Chen","Zhixing Chen"],"meta":["December 1999Information Sciences 121(1-2):113-134","DOI:10.1016/S0020-0255(99)00083-3","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221330216_The_Complexity_of_Go","220427811_Smart_Game_Board_and_Go_Explorer_A_Study_in_Software_and_Knowledge_Engineering","248859766_A_mathematical_analysis_of_Go","239066266_Computer_Go_as_a_Sum_of_Local_Games_An_Application_of_Combinatorial_Game_Theory","234825625_Sums_of_hot_and_tepid_combinatorial_games","220430771_GO_Is_Polynomial-Space_Hard","220315023_Life_in_the_Game_of_Go","2398134_Eyespace_Values_in_Go"]}
