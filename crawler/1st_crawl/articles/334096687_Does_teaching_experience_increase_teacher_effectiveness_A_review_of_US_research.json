{"id":"334096687_Does_teaching_experience_increase_teacher_effectiveness_A_review_of_US_research","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to summarize the key findings from a critical review of relevant US research to determine whether teachers, on average, improve in their effectiveness as they gain experience in the teaching profession.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper is based on the authors’ review of 30 studies published since 2003 that analyze the effect of teaching experience on student outcomes in the USA.\n\nFindings\nThe authors find that: teaching experience is positively associated with student achievement gains throughout much of a teacher’s career; as teachers gain experience, their students are more likely to do better on measures of success beyond test scores; teachers make greater gains in their effectiveness when they teach in a supportive, collegial environment, or accumulate experience in the same grade, subject or district; and more experienced teachers confer benefits to their colleagues.\n\nOriginality/value\nA renewed look at this research is warranted due to advances in methods and data systems that have allowed researchers to examine this question with greater sophistication.","authors":["Anne Podolsky","Tara Kini","Linda Darling-Hammond"],"meta":["June 2019Journal of Professional Capital and Community 4(33)","DOI:10.1108/JPCC-12-2018-0032"],"references":["328267721_The_power_of_collective_efficacy","315119901_Collective_teacher_efficacy_research_implications_for_professional_learning","308924719_School_Organizational_Contexts_Teacher_Turnover_and_Student_Achievement","303970636_What_Are_the_Effects_of_Teacher_Education_and_Preparation_on_Beginning_Teacher_Attrition","301247657_Returns_to_Teacher_Experience_Student_Achievement_and_Motivation_in_Middle_School","287698085_Principal_Support_is_Imperative_to_the_Retention_of_Teachers_in_Hard-to-Staff_Schools","335213687_Weak_Markets_Strong_Teachers_Recession_at_Career_Start_and_Teacher_Effectiveness","322929851_Public_School_Teacher_Attrition_and_Mobility_in_the_First_Five_Years_Results_from_the_First_through_Fifth_Waves_of_the_2007-08_Beginning_Teacher_Longitudinal_Study_First_Look_NCES_2015-337","286167833_Can_Good_Principals_Keep_Teachers_in_Disadvantaged_Schools_Linking_Principal_Effectiveness_to_Teacher_Satisfaction_and_Turnover_in_Hard-to-Staff_Environments","284454991_Who_Enters_Teaching_Encouraging_Evidence_That_the_Status_of_Teaching_Is_Improving"]}
