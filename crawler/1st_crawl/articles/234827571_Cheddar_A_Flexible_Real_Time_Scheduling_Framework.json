{"id":"234827571_Cheddar_A_Flexible_Real_Time_Scheduling_Framework","abstract":"This paper describes an Ada framework called Cheddar which provides tools to check if a real time application meets its temporal constraints. The framework is based on the real time scheduling theory and is mostly written for educational purposes. With Cheddar, an application is defined by a set of processors, tasks, buffers, shared resources and messages. Cheddar provides feasibility tests in the cases of monoprocessor, multiprocessor and distributed systems. It also provides a flexible simulation engine which allows the designer to describe and run simulations of specific systems. The framework is open and has been designed to be easily connected to CASE tools such as editors, design tools, simulators, ...","authors":["Frank Singhoff","Jérôme Legrand","Laurent Tchamnda Nana","L.
