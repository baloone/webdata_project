{"id":"313734268_Review_of_Fast_Calculation_Techniques_for_Computer-Generated_Holograms_With_the_Point-Light-Source-Based_Model","abstract":"Computer-generated holograms (CGHs) are a key technology in electroholography systems; however, heavy calculations are required to calculate CGHs. We review fast calculation techniques for CGH calculation of a point-lightsource- based model, which is a simple and general model of a three-dimensional object in an electroholography system. To reduce the calculation time, many methods that reduce the temporal and spatial redundancy of the CGH calculation have been developed (e.g., Look-up Table method, the Wavefront Recording Plane method, and other approximation techniques). The implementation of such methods on parallel computers (e.g., graphic processing unit and field programmable gate arrays) has also been reported.","authors":["Takashi Nishitsuji","Tomoyoshi Shimobaba","Takashi Kakue","Tomoyoshi Ito"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TII.2017.2669200"],"references":["309250087_Real-Time_electroholography_using_a_multiple-graphics_processing_unit_cluster_system_with_a_single_spatial_light_modulator_and_the_InfiniBand_network","281682387_Accelerated_one-step_generation_of_full-color_holographic_videos_using_a_color-tunable_novel-look-up-table_method_for_holographic_three-dimensional_television_broadcasting","279988757_Aerial_projection_of_three-dimensional_motion_pictures_by_electro-holography_and_parabolic_mirrors","261520146_MPEG-based_novel_look-up_table_for_rapid_generation_of_video_holograms_of_fast-moving_three-dimensional_objects","260116406_ERRATUM_Image_Size_Scalable_Full-parallax_Coloured_Three-dimensional_Video_by_Electronic_Holography","256610694_In-line_digital_holographic_microscopy_using_a_consumer_scanner","234492857_Principles_and_techniques_of_digital_holographic_microscopy","233975824_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_hologram_using_the_circular_symmetry_of_zone_plates","227398438_Effective_memory_reduction_of_the_novel_look-up_table_with_one-dimensional_sub-principle_fringe_patterns_in_computer-generated_holograms","43050853_Fast_CGH_computation_using_S-LUT_on_GPU","5497179_Recurrence_Formulas_for_Fast_Creation_of_Synthetic_Three-Dimensional_Holograms","2766592_Interactive_Computation_of_Holograms_Using_a_Look-Up_Table","312559573_Fast_calculation_techniques_for_computer-generated_holograms","309765441_Improved_look-up_table_method_of_computer-generated_holograms","286489089_Simple_and_fast_cosine_approximation_method_for_computer-generated_hologram_calculation","284545690_Real-time_time-division_color_electroholography_using_a_single_GPU_and_a_USB_module_for_synchronizing_reference_light","284518257_Three-directional_motion-compensation_mask-based_novel_look-up_table_on_graphics_processing_units_for_video-rate_generation_of_digital_holographic_videos_of_three-dimensional_scenes","274730893_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_hologram_using_run-length_encoding_based_recurrence_relation","273793416_Fast_generation_of_digital_holograms_based_on_warping_of_the_wavefront_recording_plane","267815782_Real-time_spatiotemporal_division_multiplexing_electroholography_with_a_single_graphics_processing_unit_utilizing_movie_features","266973381_Fast_one-step_calculation_of_holographic_videos_of_three-dimensional_scenes_by_combined_use_of_baseline_and_depth-compensating_principal_fringe_patterns","263709983_Three-directional_motion_compensation-based_novel-look-up-table_for_video_hologram_generation_of_three-dimensional_objects_freely_maneuvering_in_space","232610356_Fast_high-resolution_computer-generated_hologram_computation_using_multiple_graphics_processing_unit_cluster_system","226201786_Fast_Computation_of_Fresnel_Holograms_Employing_Difference","222860142_Discrete_circles_rings_and_spheres","222746241_An_efficient_computational_method_suitable_for_hardware_of_computer-generated_hologram_with_phase_computation_by_addition","221895834_Generation_of_real-time_large_computer_generated_hologram_using_wavefront_recording_method","220257202_Fast_recurrence_relation_for_computer-generated-hologram","51658706_Holographic_video_at_40_frames_per_second_for_4-million_object_points","47404128_Rapid_calculation_algorithm_of_Fresnel_computer-generated-hologram_using_look-up_table_and_wavefront-recording_plane_methods_for_three-dimensional_display","46404037_Direct_recording_of_holograms_by_a_CCD_target_and_numerical_reconstruction","38019397_Simple_and_fast_calculation_algorithm_for_computer-generated_hologram_with_wavefront_recording_plane","26717006_HORN-6_special-purpose_clustered_computing_system_for_electroholography","26265442_Special-purpose_computer_HORN-5_for_a_real-time_electroholography","23466674_Fast_generation_of_three-dimensional_video_holograms_by_combined_use_of_data_compression_and_lookup_table_techniques","7093603_Holographic_femtosecond_laser_processing_with_multiplexed_phase_Fresnel_lenses","5257950_Effective_generation_of_digital_holograms_of_three-dimensional_objects_using_a_novel_look-up_table_method"]}
