{"id":"232829265_Translators_and_translation_technology_The_dance_of_agency","abstract":"Andrew Pickering's view of agency in scientific practice challenges other views from the sociology of science in that he seeks to account for both human and non-human agency within a performative idiom of science. His approach has been applied in various contexts, within and beyond the sciences. This paper explores the potential of mobilizing Pickering's notions of the “mangle of practice” and the “dance of agency” to conceptualize translation practice, specifically to develop a deeper understanding of translators’ interaction with translation technology, both individually and collectively. I argue for the relevance of this conceptualization and make a case for a “mangle-inspired” reading of translators’ contributions to an online technical forum. However, I also reflect on how this analysis deviates from the principles of the mangle and conclude by discussing some of the methodological challenges of researching the interaction between translators and translation technology within this framework.","authors":["Maeve Olohan"],"meta":["September 2011Translation Studies 4(3):342-357","DOI:10.1080/14781700.2011.589656"],"references":["252918417_Gidden's_structuration_theory_and_information_systems_research","249014607_National_Sovereignty_versus_Universal_Rights_Interpreting_Justice_in_a_Global_Context","247927935_The_Mangle_of_Practice_Agency_and_Emergence_in_the_Sociology_of_Science","235721843_2004_The_Double_Dance_of_Agency_A_Socio-Theoretic_Account_of_How_Machines_and_Humans_Interact","235721777_The_Double_Dance_of_Agency_A_Socio-Theoretic_Account_of_How_Machines_and_Humans_Interact","235721775_Socio-Theoretic_Accounts_of_IS_The_Problem_of_Agency","233681337_CAT_Tools_in_an_Academic_Environment_What_Are_They_Good_For","233657002_Translation_technologies_Scope_tools_and_resources","41553935_Decentering_Sociology_Synthetic_Dyes_and_Social_Theory","37720623_The_Mangle_in_Practice_Science_Society_and_Becoming","31933588_From_technical_to_socio-technical_change_Tackling_the_human_and_organizational_aspects_of_systems_development_projects","313631205_Productivity_vs_Quality_A_Pilot_Study_on_the_Impact_of_Translation_Memory_Systems","299662459_Technologies_as_Forms_of_Life","283593157_A_Narrative_Account_of_the_Babels_vs_Naumann_Controversy_Competing_Perspectives_on_Activism_in_Conference_Interpreting","282174269_Translation_and_Conflict_A_Narrative_Account","257880571_The_Mangle_of_Practice_and_the_Practice_of_Chinese_Medicine_A_Case_Study_from_Nineteenth-Century_China","249563668_From_Dyes_to_Iraq_A_Reply_to_Jonathan_Harwoood","247927937_The_Mangle_of_Practice","240677988_Internal_History_and_the_Philosophy_of_Experiment","233869963_The_Constitution_of_Society_Outline_of_The_Theory_of_Structuration","233281658_Eye-tracking_and_translation_memory_matches","220531801_Material_Works_Exploring_the_Situated_Entanglement_of_Technological_Performativity_and_Human_Agency","220419144_Translators_and_TM_An_investigation_of_translators'_perceptions_of_translation_memory_adoption","220418854_Translation_Tools_An_Exploratory_Study_of_their_Adoption_by_UK_Freelance_Translators","220393242_The_surface_of_emergence_in_systems_development_Agency_institutions_and_large-scale_information_systems","37720016_Aircraft_Stories_Decentering_the_Object_in_Technoscience","31773669_Reassembling_the_Social_An_Introduction_to_Actor-Network-Theory_B_Latour"]}
