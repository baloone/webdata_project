{"id":"318190991_High-speed_logic_integrated_circuits_with_solution-processed_self-assembled_carbon_nanotubes","abstract":"As conventional monolithic silicon technology struggles to meet the requirements for the 7-nm technology node, there has been tremendous progress in demonstrating the scalability of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors down to the size that satisfies the 3-nm node and beyond. However, to date, circuits built with carbon nanotubes have overlooked key aspects of a practical logic technology and have stalled at simple functionality demonstrations. Here, we report high-performance complementary carbon nanotube ring oscillators using fully manufacturable processes, with a stage switching frequency of 2.82 GHz. The circuit was built on solution-processed, self-assembled carbon nanotube arrays with over 99.9% semiconducting purity, and the complementary feature was achieved by employing two different work function electrodes.","authors":["Shu-Jen Han","Jianshi Tang","Bharat Kumar","Abram Falk"],"meta":["July 2017Nature Nanotechnology 12(9)","DOI:10.1038/nnano.2017.115"],"references":["312558907_Scaling_carbon_nanotube_complementary_transistors_to_5-nm_gate_lengths","282437194_End-bonded_contacts_for_carbon_nanotube_transistors_with_low_size-independent_resistance","263432929_Chirality-specific_growth_of_single-walled_carbon_nanotubes_on_solid_alloy_catalysts","236459885_Using_nanoscale_thermocapillary_flows_to_create_arrays_of_purely_semiconducting_single-walled_carbon_nanotubes","313449661_Carbon_nanotube_complementary_logic_with_low-temperature_processed_end-bonded_metal_contacts","281587922_Solution-processed_carbon_nanotube_thin-film_complementary_static_random_access_memory","269331347_Carbon_nanotube_complementary_logic_based_on_Erbium_contacts_and_self-assembled_high_purity_solution_tubes","261127298_High_device_yield_carbon_nanotube_NFETs_for_high-performance_logic_applications","257074243_Carbon_nanotube_computer","236612834_Carbon_Nanotube_Complementary_Wrap-Gate_Transistors"]}
