{"id":"340715483_Getting_insight_into_the_pan-genome_structure_with_PangTree","abstract":"Background: \nThe term pan-genome was proposed to denominate collections of genomic sequences jointly analyzed or used as a reference. The constant growth of genomic data intensifies development of data structures and algorithms to investigate pan-genomes efficiently.\n\nResults: \nThis work focuses on providing a tool for discovering and visualizing the relationships between the sequences constituting a pan-genome. A new structure to represent such relationships - called affinity tree - is proposed. Each node of this tree has assigned a subset of genomes, as well as their homogeneity level and averaged consensus sequence. Moreover, subsets assigned to sibling nodes form a partition of the genomes assigned to their parent.\n\nConclusions: \nFunctionality of affinity tree is demonstrated on simulated data and on the Ebola virus pan-genome. Furthermore, two software packages are provided: PangTreeBuild constructs affinity tree, while PangTreeVis presents its result.","authors":["Paulina Dziadkiewicz","Norbert Dojer"],"meta":["April 2020BMC Genomics 21(S2)","DOI:10.1186/s12864-020-6610-4"],"references":["312546045_Fast_and_accurate_de_novo_genome_assembly_from_long_uncorrected_reads","307558016_Computational_Pan-Genomics_Status_Promises_and_Challenges","272834810_Insights_from_20_years_of_bacterial_genome_sequencing","266567167_Alignathon_A_competitive_assessment_of_whole-genome_alignment_methods","261514582_Genome_alignment_with_graph_data_structures_A_comparison","230721736_Surprisingly_diverged_populations_of_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_in_natural_environments_remote_from_human_activity","221864508_Oases_Robust_de_novo_RNA-seq_assembly_across_the_dynamic_range_of_expression_levels","322892663_Filoviruses_Ecology_Molecular_Biology_and_Evolution","281783283_Bloom_Filter_Trie_-_A_Data_Structure_for_Pan-Genome_Storage","50347213_Cactus_Graphs_for_Genome_Comparisons"]}
