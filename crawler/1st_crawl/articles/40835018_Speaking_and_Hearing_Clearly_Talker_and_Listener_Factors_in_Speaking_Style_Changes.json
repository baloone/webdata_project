{"id":"40835018_Speaking_and_Hearing_Clearly_Talker_and_Listener_Factors_in_Speaking_Style_Changes","abstract":"This article provides an overview of the research concerning the nature of the distinct, listener-oriented speaking style called 'clear speech' and its effect on intelligibility for various listener populations. We review major findings that identify talker, listener and signal characteristics that contribute to the characteristically high intelligibility of clear speech. Understanding the interplay of these factors sheds light on the interaction between higher level cognitive and lower-level sensory and perceptual factors that affect language processing. Clear speech research is, thus, relevant for both its theoretical insights and practical applications. Throughout the review, we highlight open questions and promising future directions.","authors":["Rajka Smiljanic","Ann R Bradlow"],"meta":["January 2009Language and Linguistics Compass 3(1):236-264","DOI:10.1111/j.1749-818X.2008.00112.x","SourcePubMed"],"references":["282502649_Listener_Attitudes_Toward_Speech_Supplementation","279625051_Auditory_Visual_and_Audiovisual_Speech_Intelligibility_for_Sentence-Length_Stimuli_An_Investigation_of_Conversational_and_Clear_Speech","265414241_Intelligibility_of_Normal_Speech_I_Global_and_Fine-Grained_Acoustic-Phonetic_Talker_Characteristics","290227072_The_impact_of_speech_supplementation_and_clear_speech_on_the_intelligibility_and_speaking_rate_of_people_with_traumatic_brain_injury","279605581_Across_Talker_Variability_in_Auditory_Visual_and_Audiovisual_Speech_Intelligibility_for_Conversational_and_Clear_Speech","265414199_Explaining_phonetic_variation_a_sketch_of_the_HH_theory","265413998_Confluent_Talker-_and_Listener-Related_Forces_in_Clear_Speech_Production","252145987_Speaking_clearly_for_learning-disabled_children_Sentence_perception_in_noise","246496232_Interaction_between_duration_context_and_speaking_style_in_English_stressed_vowels","243769008_The_effect_of_sentential_speaking_rate_on_the_internal_structure_of_phonetic_categories"]}
