{"id":"343701822_A_global-local_approach_for_hydraulic_phase-field_fracture_in_poroelastic_media","abstract":"In this work, phase-field modeling of hydraulic fractures in porous media is extended towards a Global–Local approach. Therein, the failure behavior is solely analyzed in a (small) local domain. In the surrounding medium, a simplified and linearized system of equations is solved. Both domains are coupled with Robin-type interface conditions. The fractures inside the local domain are allowed to propagate and consequently, both subdomains change within time. Here, a predictor–corrector strategy is adopted, in which the local domain is dynamically adjusted to the current fracture pattern. The resulting framework is algorithmically described in detail and substantiated with some numerical tests.","authors":["Fadi Aldakheel","Nima Noii","Thomas Wick","Peter Wriggers"],"meta":["June 2021Computers & Mathematics with Applications 91:99-121","DOI:10.1016/j.camwa.2020.07.013"],"references":["342934129_A_Bayesian_estimation_method_for_variational_phase-field_fracture_problems","340354450_An_iterative_staggered_scheme_for_phase_field_brittle_fracture_propagation_with_stabilizing_parameters","339043985_A_microscale_model_for_concrete_failure_in_poro-elasto-plastic_media","337628641_An_adaptive_global-local_approach_for_phase-field_modeling_of_anisotropic_brittle_fracture","335892795_A_phase_field_framework_for_capillary-induced_fracture_in_unsaturated_porous_media_Drying-induced_vs_hydraulic_cracking","331654466_A_priori_error_estimates_for_a_discretized_poro-elastic-elastic_system_solved_by_a_fixed-stress_algorithm","341680101_IPACS_Integrated_Phase-Field_Advanced_Crack_Propagation_Simulator_An_adaptive_parallel_physics-based-discretization_phase-field_framework_for_fracture_propagation_in_porous_media","338124177_An_extendedgeneralized_phase-field_finite_element_method_for_crack_growth_with_global-local_enrichment","337327918_Water-induced_failure_mechanics_for_concrete","332420204_A_phase-field_description_for_pressurized_and_non-isothermal_propagating_fractures","330508580_Phase-field_modeling_through_iterative_splitting_of_hydraulic_fractures_in_a_poroelastic_medium","328171878_Virtual_Element_Formulation_For_Phase-Field_Modeling_of_Ductile_Fracture","327533992_Modeling_of_hydraulic_fracturing_using_a_porous-media_phase-field_approach_with_reference_to_experimental_data","330485701_A_Variational_Phase-Field_Model_for_Hydraulic_Fracturing_in_Porous_Media","329725016_Parallel_solution_adaptivity_computational_convergence_and_open-source_code_of_2d_and_3d_pressurized_phase-field_fracture_problems"]}
