We aimed to develop and test a deep learning-based system to automatically detect protruding lesions of various types in WCE images.\n\nMethods: \nWe trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), using 30,584 WCE images of protruding lesions from 292 patients. We evaluated CNN performance by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, using an independent set of 17,507 test images from 93 patients, including 7,507 images of protruding lesions from 73 patients.\n\nResults: \nThe developed CNN analyzed 17,507 images in 530.462 seconds. The AUC for detection of protruding lesions was 0.911 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.9069 - 0.9155). The sensitivity and specificity of the CNN were 90.7% (95% CI, 90.0% - 91.4%) and 79.8% (95% CI, 79.0% - 80.6%), respectively, at the optimal cut-off value of 0.317 for probability score. In subgroup analysis of the category of protruding lesions, the sensitivities were 86.5%, 92.0%, 95.8%, 77.0%, and 94.4% for the detection of polyps, nodules, epithelial tumors, submucosal tumors, and venous structures, respectively. In individual patient analysis (n = 73), the detection rate of protruding lesions was 98.6%.\n\nConclusion: \nWe developed and tested a new computer-aided system based on a CNN to automatically detect various protruding lesions in WCE images. Patient-level analyses with larger cohorts and efforts to achieve better diagnostic performance are necessary in further studies.","authors":["Hiroaki Saito","Tomonori Aoki","Kazuharu Aoyama","Yusuke Kato"],"meta":["February 2020Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 92(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.gie.2020.01.054"],"references":["335034713_Artificial_intelligence_using_a_convolutional_neural_network_for_automatic_detection_of_small-bowel_angioectasia_in_capsule_endoscopy_images","334706523_Artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning_in_clinical_development_a_translational_perspective","331735917_Application_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Automated_Ulcer_Detection_in_Wireless_Capsule_Endoscopy_Images","329326545_Application_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Capsule_Endoscopy_Where_Are_We_Now","328519768_Automatic_detection_of_erosions_and_ulcerations_in_wireless_capsule_endoscopy_images_based_on_a_deep_convolutional_neural_network","325373184_Does_the_PillCam_SB3_capsule_endoscopy_system_improve_image_reading_efficiency_irrespective_of_experience_A_pilot_study","324451313_Artificial_Intelligence-Assisted_Polyp_Detection_for_Colonoscopy_Initial_Experience","322688596_CHOBS_Color_Histogram_of_Block_Statistics_for_Automatic_Bleeding_Detection_in_Wireless_Capsule_Endoscopy_Video","309145606_Capsule_endoscopy_of_the_small_bowel","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","334438921_Automatic_Detection_of_Small_Bowel_Tumors_in_Wireless_Capsule_Endoscopy_Images_Using_Ensemble_Learning","334028378_Gastroenterologist-Level_Identification_of_Small-Bowel_Diseases_and_Normal_Variants_by_Capsule_Endoscopy_Using_a_Deep-Learning_Model","329992697_A_frame_reduction_system_based_on_a_color_structural_similarity_CSS_method_and_Bayer_images_analysis_for_capsule_endoscopy","326334907_A_neural_network_algorithm_for_detection_of_GI_angiectasia_during_small-bowel_capsule_endoscopy","313354676_Deep_Learning_for_Polyp_Recognition_in_Wireless_Capsule_Endoscopy_Images","285599505_Wireless_Capsule_Endoscopy","264447265_Automatic_lesion_detection_in_capsule_endoscopy_based_on_color_saliency_Closer_to_an_essential_adjunct_for_reviewing_software","11098092_A_prospective_trial_comparing_small_bowel_radiographs_and_video_capsule_endoscopy_for_suspected_small_bowel_disease","7574262_Capsule_Endoscopy_Structured_Terminology_CEST_Proposal_of_a_Standardized_and_Structured_Terminology_for_Reporting_Capsule_Endoscopy_Procedures"]}
