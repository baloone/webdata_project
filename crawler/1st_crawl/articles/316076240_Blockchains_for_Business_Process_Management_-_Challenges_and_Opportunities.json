{"id":"316076240_Blockchains_for_Business_Process_Management_-_Challenges_and_Opportunities","abstract":"(Note that we have updated the paper to the accepted version on 23 Jan 2018)\nBlockchain technology offers a sizable promise to rethink the way inter-organizational\nbusiness processes are managed because of its potential to realize execution with-\nout a central party serving as a single point of trust (and failure). To stimulate\nresearch on this promise and the limits thereof, in this paper we outline the\nchallenges and opportunities of blockchain for Business Process Management\n(BPM). We structure our commentary alongside two established frameworks,\nnamely the six BPM core capabilities and the BPM lifecycle, and detail seven\nresearch directions for investigating the application of blockchain technology to\nBPM.","authors":["Jan Mendling","Ingo Weber","Wil Van der Aalst","Jan vom Brocke"],"meta":["January 2018ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems .
