{"id":"230960719_Roles_and_Competencies_for_Distance_Education_Programs_in_Higher_Education_Institutions","abstract":"This study had three purposes: to identify the roles and competencies needed in distance education in higher education, to rate the importance of those competencies, and to compare the results to those of a competency study conducted five years previously. The research identified thirteen roles and thirty general competencies as well as role-specific competencies. The roles of leader/change agent and trainer emerged as significant for successful implementation of distance education programs. Interpersonal-related and communication-related skills were necessary across all roles and dominated the top ten general competencies. Institutions of higher education can use the results in the staffing of distance education programs and in the design of staff/faculty development.","authors":["Peter Williams"],"meta":["March 2003American Journal of Distance Education 17(1):45-57","DOI:10.1207/S15389286AJDE1701_4","Project: Create new project \"Distance Education in Higher Education, Roles and Competencies\""],"references":["237404371_Three_Types_of_Interaction","313093707_Emerging_roles_for_instructors_and_learners_in_the_web-based_instruction_classroom","301339689_A_Delphi_evaluation_of_agreement_between_organizations","288069122_The_Evolution_of_Distance_Learning","284194124_Gazing_Into_the_Oracle_the_Delphi_Method_and_its_Application_to_Social_Policy_and_Public_Health","249698151_A_General_Theory_of_the_Doctorate_in_Education","240409717_Web-Based_Instruction_WBI_What_Is_It_and_Why_Is_It","239062620_Identifying_Critical_Issues_and_Problems_In_Technology_Education_Using_A_Modified-Delphi_Technique","239061158_Computer_based_Delphi_processes","238745180_IIIB_4_A_Delphi_Evaluation_of_Agreement_between_Organizations"]}
