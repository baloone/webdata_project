{"id":"353730836_Estimation_of_speed_armature_temperature_and_resistance_in_brushed_DC_machines_using_a_CFNN_based_on_BFGS_BP","abstract":"In this paper, a sensorless speed and armature resistance and temperature estimator for Brushed (B) DC machines is proposed, based on a Cascade-Forward Neural Network (CFNN) and Quasi-Newton BFGS backpropagation (BP). Since we wish to avoid the use of a thermal sensor, a thermal model is needed to estimate the temperature of the BDC machine. Previous studies propose either non-intelligent estimators which depend on the model, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Luenberger's observer, or estimators which do not estimate the speed, temperature and resistance simultaneously. The proposed method has been verified both by simulation and by comparison with the simulation results available in the literature","authors":["Hacene Mellah","Kamel Eddine Hemsas","Taleb Rachid","Carlo Cecati"],"meta":["November 2018Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences 26(6):3181-3191"],"references":["317343312_A_neural_network_approach_to_navigation_of_a_mobile_robot_and_obstacle_avoidance_in_dynamic_and_unknown_environments","316050178_Iris_nevus_diagnosis_Convolutional_neural_network_and_deep_belief_network","309613099_QoS_prediction_methods_to_avoid_SLA_violation_in_post-interaction_time_phase","322276975_A_new_extension_of_the_Kalman_filter_to_nonlinear_systems","316050082_A_self-tuning_NeuroFuzzy_feedback_linearization-based_damping_control_strategy_for_multiple_HVDC_links","313623952_Artificial_Neural_Network_ANN_based_Model_Predictive_Control_MPC_and_Optimization_of_HVAC_Systems_A_State_of_the_Art_Review_and_Case_Study_of_a_Residential_HVAC_System","313569292_Identification_and_control_of_dynamical_systems_using_neural_networks","313066961_Electrical_insulation_for_rotating_machines-design_evaluation_aging_testing_and_repair_-_Book_review","311853946_Modeling_surface_tension_of_pure_refrigerants_using_feed-forward_back-propagation_neural_networks","309196681_Modelling_of_dust_removal_in_rotating_packed_bed_using_Artificial_Neural_Networks_ANN"]}
