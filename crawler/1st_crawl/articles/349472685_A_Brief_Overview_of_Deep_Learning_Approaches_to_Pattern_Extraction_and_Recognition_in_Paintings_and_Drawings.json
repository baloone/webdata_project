{"id":"349472685_A_Brief_Overview_of_Deep_Learning_Approaches_to_Pattern_Extraction_and_Recognition_in_Paintings_and_Drawings","abstract":"This paper provides a brief overview of some of the most relevant deep learning approaches to visual art pattern extraction and recognition, particularly painting and drawing. Indeed, recent advances in deep learning and computer vision, coupled with the growing availability of large digitized visual art collections, have opened new opportunities for computer science researchers to assist the art community with automatic tools to analyze and further understand visual arts. Among other benefits, a deeper understanding of visual arts has the potential to make them more accessible to a wider population, both in terms of fruition and creation, thus supporting the spread of culture.","authors":["Giovanna Castellano","Gennaro Vessio"],"meta":["February 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-68796-0_35","In book: Pattern Recognition.
