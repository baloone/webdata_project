{"id":"288060227_Synchronization_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Heterogeneous_Controllers","abstract":"This paper studies the synchronization of a multi-agent system where the\nagents are coupled through heterogeneous controller gains. Synchronization\nrefers to the situation where all the agents in a group have a common velocity\ndirection. We generalize existing results and show that by using heterogeneous\ncontroller gains, the final velocity direction at which the system of agents\nsynchronize can be controlled. The effect of heterogeneous gains on the\nreachable set of this final velocity direction is further analyzed. We also\nshow that for realistic systems, a limited control force to stabilize the\nagents to the synchronized condition can be achieved by confining these\nheterogeneous controller gains to an upper bound. Simulations are given to\nsupport the theoretical findings.","authors":["Anoop Jain","Debasish Ghose"],"meta":["July 2017Nonlinear Dynamics 89(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11071-017-3526-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["307092816_Practical_bipartite_synchronization_via_pinning_control_on_a_network_of_nonlinear_agents_with_antagonistic_interactions","299375002_Adaptive_synchronized_tracking_of_heterogeneous_spherical_robots_using_distributed_hierarchical_sliding_surfaces_under_a_directed_graph","281574088_Collision-Free_Formation_Control_with_Decentralized_Connectivity_Preservation_for_Nonholonomic-Wheeled_Mobile_Robots","311531704_Adaptive_output_synchronization_of_heterogeneous_network_with_an_uncertain_leader","309628655_An_input-based_triggering_approach_to_leader-following_problems","305952393_Admissible_output_consensualization_control_for_singular_multi-agent_systems_with_time_delays","289917616_Pinning_synchronization_for_a_class_of_complex_dynamical_networks_with_heterogeneous_delays","288888159_Output_Synchronization_of_Nonidentical_Linear_Multiagent_Systems","281307785_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems_Using_Aperiodic_Sampled-Data_Control","280971810_Exponential_synchronization_of_nonlinear_multi-agent_systems_with_time_delays_and_impulsive_disturbances","280917119_Uniform_synchronization_in_multi-agent_systems_with_switching_topologies","277726316_Finite-time_synchronization_of_Kuramoto-type_oscillators","276453496_Synchronization_in_oscillator_networks_with_time_delay_and_limited_non-homogeneous_coupling_strength","276396841_Distributed_Synchronization_Control_of_Multiagent_Systems_With_Unknown_Nonlinearities","275983260_Linear_Algebra"]}
