{"id":"281737158_A_study_on_the_organization_and_management_systems_of_Turkish_shipping_companies","abstract":"The Turkish maritime posture is changing rapidly. Turkish shipowners now have over 30.3 millions DWT fleet and modern and big size ships replacing old vessels. The quantity and quality of the ports and terminals are significantly increasing. The shipping companies are reorganizing to adapt themselves for new operational and economic requirements. Better organizations and management systems are required to support this modernized fleet and improving shore facilities.\nThe shipping companies are the leading element of the shipping sector. They play a crucial role in understanding existing and future requirements for national maritime industry and they develop plans, programmes and policies to survive in todayâ€™s challenging world.\nThe shipping sector introduces a volatile character and it is not transparent. Therefore, it is not so easy to gather information on all the aspects of the shipping companies such as financial status, future plans and strategies. On the other hand, it is relatively easier to collect information on organization and management systems of the companies, which provide significant information on their capabilities and modus operandi.\nIn this study it is intended to make a SWOT analysis of these companies based on their organization and management systems, using the expertise and different views of the professionals. In light of the results of the analysis, some findings which may lead to future studies are also discussed.","authors":["Ergun Demirel"],"meta":["July 2015Journal of Human Sciences 12(2):51","DOI:10.14687/ijhs.v12i2.3165"],"references":["346470332_Maritime_Economics_Second_Edition","311366468_Research_in_Personnel_and_Human_Resources_Management"]}
