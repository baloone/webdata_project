{"id":"314209932_Robust_Interpolation_of_Correspondences_for_Large_Displacement_Optical_Flow","abstract":"The interpolation of correspondences (EpicFlow) was widely used for optical flow estimation in most-recent works. It has the advantage of edge-preserving and efficiency. However, it is vulnerable to input matching noise, which is inevitable in modern matching techniques. In this paper, we present a Robust Interpolation method of Correspondences (called RicFlow) to overcome the weakness. First, the scene is over-segmented into superpixels to revitalize an early idea of piecewise flow model. Then, each model is estimated robustly from its support neighbors based on a graph constructed on superpixels. We propose a propagation mechanism among the pieces in the estimation of models. The propagation of models is significantly more efficient than the independent estimation of each model, yet retains the accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that RicFlow is more robust than EpicFlow, and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Yinlin Hu","Yunsong Li","Rui Song"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2017.509","Conference: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017)","Project: optical flow in the real world"],"references":["319770165_Optical_Flow_with_Semantic_Segmentation_and_Localized_Layers","308277922_Fast_Optical_Flow_Using_Dense_Inverse_Search","319770637_Performance_evaluation_of_RANSAC_family","314635674_Deep_Discrete_Flow","311611175_Efficient_Coarse-to-Fine_PatchMatch_for_Large_Displacement_Optical_Flow","311609843_PatchBatch_A_Batch_Augmented_Loss_for_Optical_Flow","308854455_EpicFlow_Edge-preserving_interpolation_of_correspondences_for_optical_flow","308295860_Fast_Guided_Global_Interpolation_for_Depth_and_Motion","308277981_Exploiting_Semantic_Information_and_Deep_Matching_for_Optical_Flow","304604590_Object_scene_flow_for_autonomous_vehicles"]}
