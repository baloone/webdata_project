Introduction and Preliminaries\nIn mathematics, graph theory plays an important role in understanding the relationship between pair of objects through graphs. Today, graph theory has a number of applications in the field of engineering, computer science, and other sciences (see [1–3]). The idea of linking graph with algebraic structure gave rise to new research in the field of mathematics. This idea explores the interaction between structures of algebraic objects and graphs by using properties of graphs and algebraic structures. In the past, many researchers associated graphs with different algebraic structures (see [4–11]).\nA graph is an ordered pair with the vertex set and the edge set . The order and the size of the graph are the cardinality of its vertex set and edge, respectively. A graph is connected if for any two vertices , there is a path connecting and . The distance between two vertices is the length of the shortest path between them and is denoted by . The length of the longest path in is the diameter of , denoted by . Length of a shortest cycle in the graph is referred to as the girth of the graph. A graph is complete if for any two vertices, there is an edge between them. A subgraph of a graph is a clique if is a complete graph, and the order of maximal clique is called the clique number of , denoted by . A graph is regular if all of its vertices have the same degree. For more undefined terminologies related to graph theory, see [12–14].\nNumerical semigroup theory is the study of set of positive integer solutions of diophantine equations (see [15–18]), and this is very useful in the study of algebraic geometry codes (see [19–21]). Let us recall some definitions from the numerical semigroup theory, which we used in the later sections.\nA subset of nonnegative integers is called submonoid if the following holds:(1) (2) If , then\nA submonoid is called numerical semigroup if is finite. The least positive integer in , denoted by , is known as the multiplicity of the numerical semigroup. The elements of are called the gaps of , and the largest of these gaps is known as the Frobenius number, denoted by . It is well known that every numerical semigroup is finitely generated; that is, there exist such that . Moreover, every numerical semigroup has a unique minimal system of generators. The cardinality of the minimal system of generators is called the embedding dimension of numerical semigroup , denoted by . A subset of numerical semigroup is ideal (integral ideal) of if (that is, and , the element is in ). An ideal is an irreducible ideal if it cannot be written as intersection of two ideals which properly contain it.\nA connection of graphs with numerical semigroups can be found in [22]. In this paper, we investigated the interplay between the structure of numerical semigroups and graph theoretic properties of specific graphs gained from numerical semigroups. The sketch of this paper is as follows.\nIn Section 2, we briefly describe the concept of connectedness, diameter, and girth of . In Section 3, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph associated with an ideal of a numerical semigroup to be complete. In Section 4, we discuss the concept of clique number and cut point of .\n\n2. Connectedness, Diameter, and Girth of\nWe start this section by showing that is always a connected graph. Also, we show that the diameter of is equal or less than 2 and girth of is 3.\nProposition 1. Let be a numerical semigroup and be an ideal of . Then, is a connected graph of finite order with at least one vertex of degree .\nProof. Choose , the Frobenius number, and , the least element. Then, note that for all . This gives that is always finite, and therefore, is finite. We may assume that is the largest element of not in as is finite. This gives that , . Therefore, is a connected graph of finite order with degree of and is equal to .\nExample 1. Let be a numerical semigroup and be an ideal of . Then, and the graph is shown in Figure 1.","authors":["Peng Xu","Muhammad Ahsan Banyamin","Adnan Aslam","Wajid Ali"],"meta":["September 2020Journal of Mathematics 2020(9)","DOI:10.1155/2020/6094372"],"references":["333888260_Characterization_of_Graphs_Associated_with_Numerical_Semigroups","332012041_APPLICATIONS_OF_GRAPH_THEORY_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_AN_OVERVIEW","320214896_Total_graph_of_a_0-distributive_lattice","241001110_Intersection_graphs_of_subgroups_of_finite_groups","268652783_On_a_linear_Diophantine_problem_of_Frobenius","268609590_Intersection_graph_of_submodules_of_a_module","267178336_The_intersection_graph_of_ideals_of_a_poset","266956360_Algebraic_geometry_codes","265701792_On_the_linear_Diophantine_problem_of_Frobenius","244469319_Mathematical_questions_with_their_solutions"]}
