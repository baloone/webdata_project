{"id":"291044709_Axiomatic_rewriting_theory_VI_Residual_theory_revisited","abstract":"Residual theory is the algebraic theory ofconfluence for the λ-calculus, and more generally conflict-free rewriting systems (=without critical pairs). The theory took its modern shape in Lévy’s PhD thesis, after Church, Rosser and Curry’s seminal steps. There, Lévy introduces a permutation equivalence between rewriting paths, and establishes that among all confluence diagrams P → N ← Q completing a span P ← M → Q, there exists a minimum such one, modulo permutation equivalence. Categorically, the diagram is called a pushout. In this article, we extend Lévy’s residual theory, in order to enscope “border-line” rewriting systems, which admit critical pairs but enjoy a strong Church-Rosser property (=existence ofpushouts.) Typical examples are the associativity rule and the positive braid rewriting systems. Finally, we show that the resulting theory reformulates and clarifies Lévy’s optimality theory for the λ-calculus, and its so-called “extraction procedure”.","authors":["P.-A.
