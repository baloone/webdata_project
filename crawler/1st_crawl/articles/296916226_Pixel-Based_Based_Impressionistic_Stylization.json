{"id":"296916226_Pixel-Based_Based_Impressionistic_Stylization","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-based stylization technique that analyzes and transfers impressionistic styles. A pixel-based stylization technique has tended to focus on only a single term (color or texture), so that it is not easy for them to express complex styles, such as impressionist paintings. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-based stylization technique that analyze and transfer impressionistic styles. We analyze regions of a source image with respect to three characteristics – color pattern, texture, and flow pattern – and then transfer each region's impressionistic style to a target image based on saliency similarities.","authors":["Hochang Lee","Dehi Kang","Taemin Lee","Kyunghyun Yoon"],"meta":["January 2016International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 11(1):267-280","DOI:10.14257/ijmue.2016.11.1.26"],"references":["41677839_Edge-Preserving_Multiscale_Image_Decomposition_based_on_Local_Extrema"]}
