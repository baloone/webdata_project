{"id":"288178631_Game_Theory_for_Networks_A_tutorial_on_game-theoretic_tools_for_emerging_signal_processing_applications","abstract":"The aim of this tutorial is to provide an overview, although necessarily incomplete, of game theory (GT) for signal processing (SP) in networks. One of the main features of this contribution is to gather in a single article some fundamental game-theoretic notions and tools that, over the past few years, have become widespread in the SP literature. In particular, both strategic-form and coalition-form games are described in detail, and the key connections and differences between them are outlined. Moreover, particular attention is also devoted to clarifying the connections between strategic-form games and distributed optimization and learning algorithms. Beyond an introduction to the basic concepts and main solution approaches, several carefully designed examples are provided to allow a better understanding of how to apply the described tools.","authors":["Giacomo Bacci","Samson Lasaulce","Walid Saad","Luca Sanguinetti"],"meta":["January 2016IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 33(1):94-119","DOI:10.1109/MSP.2015.2451994"],"references":["275527197_Understanding_Game_Theory_via_Wireless_Power_Control_Lecture_Notes","267454465_Crawford-Sobel_meet_Lloyd-Max_on_the_grid","324396684_Game_Theory","317415397_Optimal_decentralized_protocol_for_electric_vehicle_charging","313672585_Multilinear_extensions_of_games","313101713_Games_with_incomplete_information_played_by_Bayesian_players_Part_I","310829942_Selfish_Routing_In_Capacitated_Networks","278768710_Game_Theory_and_Learning_for_Wireless_Networks_Fundamentals_and_Applications","275619590_Stochastic_Models_For_Learning","267132783_Game_Theory_in_Wireless_and_Communication_Networks_Theory_Models_and_Applications"]}
