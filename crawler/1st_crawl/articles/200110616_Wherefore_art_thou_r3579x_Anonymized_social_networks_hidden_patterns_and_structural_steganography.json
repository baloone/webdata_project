{"id":"200110616_Wherefore_art_thou_r3579x_Anonymized_social_networks_hidden_patterns_and_structural_steganography","abstract":"In a social network, nodes correspond to people or other social en- tities, and edges correspond to social links between them. In an effort to preserve privacy, the practice of anonymization replaces names with meaningless unique identifiers. We describe a family of attacks such that even from a single anonymized copy of a social network, it is possible for an adversary to learn whether edges exist or not between specific targeted pairs of nodes.","authors":["Backstrom","Lars","Dwork","Cynthia"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1145/1242572.1242598"],"references":["228057597_An_Omn_Gomory-Hu_Tree_Construction_Algorithm_for_Unweighted_Graphs","220538611_Resisting_structural_identification_in_anonymized_social_networks","265973077_Robust_De-anonymization_of_Large_Datasets_How_to_Break_Anonymity_of_the_Netflix_Prize_Dataset","262235629_Privacy-preserving_data_mining","221669714_Multi-Terminal_Network_Flows","221590176_The_price_of_privacy_and_the_limits_of_LP_decoding","221559412_Privacy_via_pseudorandom_sketches","220908275_Differential_Privacy_A_Survey_of_Results","200775167_Structure_and_Evolution_of_Online_Social_Networks","12260117_Weaving_Technology_and_Policy_Together_to_Maintain_Confidentiality","3296992_Protecting_Respondents'_Identities_in_Microdata_Release"]}
