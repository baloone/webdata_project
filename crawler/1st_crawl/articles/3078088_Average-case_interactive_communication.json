{"id":"3078088_Average-case_interactive_communication","abstract":"X and Y are random variables. Person P<sub>x</sub> knows X, Person\nP<sub>y</sub> knows Y, and both know the joint probability distribution\nof the pair (X,Y). Using a predetermined protocol, they communicate over\na binary error-free channel in order for P<sub>y</sub> to learn X.\nP<sub>x</sub> may or may not learn Y. It is determined how many\ninformation bits must be transmitted (by both persons) on the average.\nThe results show that, when the arithmetic average number of bits is\nconsidered, there is no asymptotic advantage to P<sub>x</sub> knowing Y\nin advance and four messages are asymptotically optimum. By contrast,\nfor the worst-case number of bits, communication can be significantly\nreduced if P<sub>x</sub> knows Y in advance, and it is not known whether\na constant number of messages is asymptotically optimum","authors":["Alon Orlitsky"],"meta":["October 1992IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 38(5):1534 - 1547","DOI:10.1109/18.149503","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["221591767_Lower_Bounds_on_Communication_Complexity","250956222_On_the_Size_of_Separating_Systems_and_Families_of_Perfect_Hash_Functions","250955182_Fredman-Komlos_bounds_and_information_theory","238677868_Some_complexity_questions_related_to_distributed_computing","224773133_Elements_of_information_theory_2nd_ed","223869619_Lower_bounds_on_communication_complexity","221591676_Some_Complexity_Questions_Related_to_Distributive_Computing_Preliminary_Report","221590318_Communication_Complexity","221590157_Rounds_in_Communication_Complexity_Revisited","220682324_Worst-case_interactive_communication--II_Two_messages_are_not_optimal","220617837_Constructing_Onlog_n_Size_Monotone_Formulae_for_the_k_th_Threshold_Function_of_n_Boolean_Variables","220573469_Communication_Complexity","4355284_Storing_a_Sparse_Table_with_01_Worst_Case_Access_Time","3770672_Interactive_Data_Compression","3770623_Constructing_On_Log_n_Size_Monotone_Formulae_For_The_k-th_Elementary_Symmetric_Polynomial_Of_n_Boolean_Variables","3510361_Interactive_communication_balanced_distributions_correlatedfiles_and_average-case_complexity","3082524_Universal_Codeword_Sets_and_Representations_of_the_Integers","3082237_Noiseless_coding_of_correlated_information_sources","3077657_Worst-case_interactive_communication_I_Two_messages_are_almost_optimal","2664071_Interactive_Communication_of_Balanced_Distributions_and_of_Correlated_Files"]}
