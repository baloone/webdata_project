{"id":"309672194_Signing_avatars_making_education_more_inclusive","abstract":"In Brazil, there are approximately 9.7 million inhabitants who are deaf or hard of hearing. Moreover, about 30% of the Brazilian deaf community is illiterate in Brazilian Portuguese due to difficulties to offer deaf children an inclusive environment based on bilingual education. Currently, the prevailing teaching practice depends heavily on verbal language and on written material, making the inclusion of the deaf a challenging task. This paper presents the author’s approach for tackling this problem and improving deaf students’ accessibility to written material in order to help them master Brazilian Portuguese as a second language. We describe an ongoing project aimed at developing an automatic Brazilian Portuguese-to-Libras translation system that presents the translated content via an animated virtual human, or avatar. The paper describes the methodology adopted to compile a source language corpus having the deaf student needs in central focus. It also describes the construction of a parallel Brazilian Portuguese/Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) corpus based on motion capture technology. The envisioned translation architecture includes the definition of an Intermediate Language to drive the signing avatar. The results of a preliminary assessment of signs intelligibility highlight the application potential.","authors":["José Mario De Martino","Ivani Rodrigues Silva","Carmen Zink Bolognini","Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa"],"meta":["August 2017Universal Access in the Information Society 16(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10209-016-0504-x"],"references":["305689624_Building_a_Brazilian_Portuguese_-_Brazilian_Sign_Language_Parallel_Corpus_using_Motion_Capture_Data","295853511_FALIBRAS_uma_ferramenta_flexivel_para_promover_acessibilidade_de_pessoas_surdas","277009795_Passenger_information_using_a_sign_language_avatar_-_Individual_travel_assistance_for_passengers_with_special_needs_in_public_transport","268379527_SISTEMA_FALIBRAS_UM_INTERPRETE_VIRTUAL_COMO_FERRAMENTA_DE_APOIO_PEDAGOGICO_A_EDUCACAO_DE_SURDOS","258108424_A_rule-based_translation_from_written_Spanish_to_Spanish_Sign_Language_glosses","313364057_Arabic_Text_to_Arabic_Sign_Language_Translation_System_for_the_Deaf_and_Hearing-Impaired_Community","309513877_Sign_Language_3D_Virtual_Agent","293183702_Generos_discursivos_do_Circulo_de_Bakhtin_e_multiletramentos","262347517_Bayesian_Networks","262254296_Backus-Naur_form_BNF","257472195_Design_development_and_field_evaluation_of_a_Spanish_into_sign_language_translation_system","255389908_RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather_A_Large_Vocabulary_Sign_Language_Recognition_and_Translation_Corpus","242755833_Transcricao_de_dados_de_uma_lingua_sinalizada_Um_estudo_piloto_da_transcricao_de_narrativas_na_lingua_de_sinais_brasileira_LSB","255375858_Analysis_Preparation_and_Optimization_of_Statistical_Sign_Language_Machine_Translation","243695077_Corpus_Linguistics_and_Translation_Studies_-_Implications_and_Applications"]}
