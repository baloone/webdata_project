{"id":"325777282_Expression_and_efficient_evaluation_of_fuzzy_quantified_structural_queries_to_fuzzy_graph_databases","abstract":"This paper deals with fuzzy quantified queries in a graph database context. We study a particular type of structural quantified query and show how it can be expressed in an extension of the Neo4j Cypher query language. A processing strategy based on a compilation mechanism that derives regular (nonfuzzy) queries for accessing the relevant data is also described. Then, some experiments are performed that show the tractability of this approach.","authors":["Olivier Pivert","Olfa Slama","Virginie Thion"],"meta":["June 2018Fuzzy Sets and Systems 366(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.fss.2018.06.002","Project: Open Data INtellignece"],"references":["280044906_On_a_Fuzzy_Algebra_for_Querying_Graph_Databases","275581413_Expression_and_Efficient_Processing_of_Fuzzy_Queries_in_a_Graph_Database_Context","307442727_Extracting_Fuzzy_Summaries_from_NoSQL_Graph_Databases","307435385_Fuzzy_Quantified_Structural_Queries_to_Fuzzy_Graph_Databases","306925382_SUGAR_A_graph_database_fuzzy_querying_system","303420641_Fuzzy_Preference_Queries_to_Relational_Databases","289174044_Fuzzy_Queries_over_NoSQL_Graph_Databases_Perspectives_for_Extending_the_Cypher_Language","284567769_Quantified_Statements_and_Database_Fuzzy_Querying","278709625_Social_Network_Database_Querying_Based_on_Computing_with_Words","268606419_Fuzzy_Set-Theoretic_Operators_and_Quantifiers"]}
