{"id":"343719689_Sustainable_Development_and_Industry_40_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_Identifying_Key_Scientific_Problems_of_the_Sustainable_Industry_40","abstract":"The main aim of the manuscript is the identification of key research problems in the field of sustainable development, in the era of implementing the Industry 4.0 concept. The manuscript presents results of the bibliometric analysis in the subject: “Sustainable Industry 4.0”. The bibliometric analysis was realized in three segments: Sustainability, Industry 4.0 and Sustainable Industry 4.0. In the analysis, the following databases were used: Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, Google Scholar. The main purpose of the analysis was to outline the dynamics of publications in the categories: citation, author, country, type document, science field, research area. The review of sources carried out in this way allowed us to identify key research areas and confirm the research thesis adopted in the manuscript. The research thesis: Sustainable Industry 4.0 allows the integration of the Industry 4.0 concept with sustainable development goals. The article is dedicated especially to scientists looking for still unsolved research problems in the implementation of sustainable Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the manuscript could be an inspiration for scientists, stakeholders, practitioners and governments to complete today’s knowledge about the problems of sustainability in Industry 4.0.","authors":["Bożena Gajdzik","Sandra Grabowska","Sebastian Saniuk","Tadeusz Wieczorek"],"meta":["August 2020Energies 13(16):4254","DOI:10.3390/en13164254"],"references":["343237705_Simulation_Modeling_of_the_Sustainable_Supply_Chain","339820487_Industry_40_How_it_is_defined_from_a_sociotechnical_perspective_and_how_much_sustainability_it_includes_-_A_literature_review","339419249_Social_Expectations_and_Market_Changes_in_the_Context_of_Developing_the_Industry_40_Concept","337695080_Literature_Review_on_Sustainable_Logistics_and_Sustainable_Production_for_Industry_40","345628948_Sustainable_Smart-Farming_Framework_Smart_Farming","345123371_Smart_City_Governance_for_Sustainable_Public_Value_Generation","340070785_How_does_an_industry_reduce_waste_and_consumed_energy_within_a_multi-stage_smart_sustainable_biofuel_production_system","337701765_The_Role_and_Impact_of_Industry_40_on_Business_Models","337687178_Sustainable_energy_for_smart_city","337605249_Sustainable_Development_in_Industry_40","337224622_How_Can_Organisations_and_Business_Models_Lead_to_a_More_Sustainable_Society_A_Framework_from_a_Systematic_Review_of_the_Industry_40","336386920_Scopus_scientific_mapping_production_in_industry_40_2011-2018_a_bibliometric_analysis","336355460_Sustainable_Smart_Urbanism_Indicators_in_Bahrain","337410066_Sustainable_and_Smart_Energy_Society","336865010_How_sustainable_is_smart_and_how_smart_is_sustainable"]}
