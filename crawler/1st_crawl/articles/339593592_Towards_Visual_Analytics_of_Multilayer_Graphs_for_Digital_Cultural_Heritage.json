{"id":"339593592_Towards_Visual_Analytics_of_Multilayer_Graphs_for_Digital_Cultural_Heritage","abstract":"In this extended abstract we examine the visual analytics requirements of researchers in the field of Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) and we look at the current approaches used by researchers in this field. We suggest that data structures produced during the analysis of a DCH corpus, might better be modeled as a set of interrelated graphs and subgraphs, that together form a \"multilayer graph\", a concept recently defined within the field of complex systems. We consider some existing visualization approaches that may be suitable for visualizing and analyzing DCH data within a multilayer graph visual analytics system. We examine how to build a multilayer graph data set from DCH data. We also describe an initial set of tasks, based on interviews and discuss how we will use the expertise of professional researchers in the field of DCH to evaluate and validate our design decisions made as part of our research.","authors":["Fintan Mcgee","Marten DÃ¼ring","Mohammad Ghoniem"],"meta":["January 2016","Conference: Workshop on Visualization for the Digital Humanities, an IEEE Vis workshop"],"references":["308992118_The_dynamics_of_helping_behavior_for_Jewish_refugees_during_the_Second_World_War_The_importance_of_brokerage","270453414_Overview_The_Design_Adoption_and_Analysis_of_a_Visual_Document_Mining_Tool_For_Investigative_Journalists","265960107_La_connaissance_est_un_reseau_Perspective_sur_l'organisation_archivistique_et_encyclopedique","337971759_Social_Network_Analysis_SNA_als_Methode_einer_textempirischen_Literaturwissenschaft","308992117_Historical_Network_Research_Network_analysis_in_the_historical_disciplines","308991658_histograph_Graph-based_exploration_crowdsourced_indexation","300076466_Multilayer_Graph_Edge_Bundling","299032701_Graphs_maps_trees_-_Abstract_models_for_literary_history_-_2","289173435_Experimental_human-computer_interaction_A_practical_guide_with_visual_examples","272438832_Character_Networks_and_Centrality"]}
