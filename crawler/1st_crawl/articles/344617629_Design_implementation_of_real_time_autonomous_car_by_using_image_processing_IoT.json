{"id":"344617629_Design_implementation_of_real_time_autonomous_car_by_using_image_processing_IoT","abstract":"Because of the inaccessibility of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure correspondence in the present delivering frameworks, (TLD), Traffic sign Detection and path identification are as yet thought to be a significant task in self-governing vehicles and Driver Assistance \nSystems (DAS) or self Driving Car. For progressively exact outcome, businesses are moving to profound Neural Network Models Like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as opposed to Traditional models like HOG and so forth. Profound neural Network can remove and take in increasingly unadulterated highlights from the Raw RGB picture got from nature. In any case, profound neural systems like CNN have a highly complex calculation. This paper proposes an Autonomous vehicle or robot that can identify the diverse article in condition and group them utilizing CNN model and through this information it can take some continuous choice which can be utilized in the self Driving vehicle or Autonomous Car or Driving Assistant System (DAS).","authors":["Irfan Ahmad Ganie","Karunakar Pothuganti"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.1109/ICSSIT48917.2020.9214125","Conference: IEEE Sponsored International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT 2020)At: Tirunelveli India"],"references":["342393149_INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGIES_SHAPING_THE_WORLD_UNDER_THE_PANDEMIC_COVID_19","342220972_Challenges_and_Solution_for_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Cybersecurity_of_the_USA","318802136_An_efficient_vision-based_traffic_light_detection_and_state_recognition_for_autonomous_vehicles","308823329_Integrating_visual_selective_attention_model_with_HOG_features_for_traffic_light_detection_and_recognition","304450538_Multihop_V2I_Communications_A_Feasibility_Study_Modeling_and_Performance_Analysis","304249243_DeepTLR_A_Single_Deep_Convolutional_Network_for_Detection_and_Classification_of_Traffic_Lights","281810251_Saliency_Map_Generation_by_the_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Real-Time_Traffic_Light_Detection_Using_Template_Matching","264859240_Tracking_both_pose_and_status_of_a_traffic_light_via_an_Interacting_Multiple_Model_filter","254053485_Advanced_Driver_Assistance_Systems_-_Past_present_and_future","325420077_A_cGANs-Based_Scene_Reconstruction_Model_Using_Lidar_Point_Cloud","322625996_Traffic_light_detection_for_colorblind_individuals","322281970_The_application_of_deep_learning_in_computer_vision","322060670_Traffic_Light_Detection_for_Colorblind_Individuals","321122240_Vision-Based_Traffic_Light_Detection_for_Intelligent_Vehicles","320173975_Traffic_Light_Recognition_for_Complex_Scene_With_Fusion_Detections","318694046_A_deep_learning_approach_to_traffic_lights_Detection_tracking_and_classification","316702154_Automatic_Incident_Detection_in_Intelligent_Transportation_Systems_Using_Aggregation_of_Traffic_Parameters_Collected_Through_V2I_Communications","311918520_Traffic_light_status_detection_using_movement_patterns_of_vehicles","309441973_Accurate_and_Reliable_Detection_of_Traffic_Lights_Using_Multiclass_Learning_and_Multiobject_Tracking","308809148_Automatic_detection_of_traffic_lights_using_support_vector_machine","293012372_Vision_for_Looking_at_Traffic_Lights_Issues_Survey_and_Perspectives","283949040_Real-Time_Traffic_Light_Detection_With_Adaptive_Background_Suppression_Filter","277562040_Mobile_Standards-Based_Traffic_Light_Detection_in_Assistive_Devices_for_Individuals_with_Color-Vision_Deficiency","261119818_Design_Concept_and_Method_of_Advanced_Driver_Assistance_Systems","261073526_Computer_vision_and_image_processing_at_the_University_of_Waikato","260359456_Vision-Based_Traffic_Sign_Detection_and_Analysis_for_Intelligent_Driver_Assistance_Systems_Perspectives_and_Survey"]}
