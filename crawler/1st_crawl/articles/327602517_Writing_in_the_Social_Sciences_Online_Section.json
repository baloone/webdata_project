{"id":"327602517_Writing_in_the_Social_Sciences_Online_Section","abstract":"INTRODUCTORY ESSAY Writing in the Social Sciences is an undergraduate upper division writing course required for social science majors (including anthropology, sociology, and psychology), and the course also fulfills the upper division writing requirement for the university. While the majority of students enrolled in the class are social science majors, students with other majors including computer science, economics, education, health sciences, and business take the course as well. The writing class is taught every semester and is offered as either an online or a classroom-based course. The following syllabus is for the online version of the course. This version of the course is influenced by my experiences helping social science majors in the University Writing Center with their writing and with applications for graduate school. The course introduces upper division students to undergraduate publication opportunities, research-focused essays, and graduate school applications and materials.
