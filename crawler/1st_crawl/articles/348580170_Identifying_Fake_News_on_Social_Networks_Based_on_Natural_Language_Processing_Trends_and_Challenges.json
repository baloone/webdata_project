{"id":"348580170_Identifying_Fake_News_on_Social_Networks_Based_on_Natural_Language_Processing_Trends_and_Challenges","abstract":"The epidemic spread of fake news is a side effect of the expansion of social networks to circulate news, in contrast to traditional mass media such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. Human inefficiency to distinguish between true and false facts exposes fake news as a threat to logical truth, democracy, journalism, and credibility in government institutions. In this paper, we survey methods for preprocessing data in natural language, vectorization, dimensionality reduction, machine learning, and quality assessment of information retrieval. We also contextualize the identification of fake news, and we discuss research initiatives and opportunities.","authors":["Nicollas Rodrigues de Oliveira","Pedro S.
