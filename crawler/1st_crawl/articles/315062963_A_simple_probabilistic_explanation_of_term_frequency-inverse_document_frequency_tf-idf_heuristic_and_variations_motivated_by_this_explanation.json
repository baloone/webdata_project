{"id":"315062963_A_simple_probabilistic_explanation_of_term_frequency-inverse_document_frequency_tf-idf_heuristic_and_variations_motivated_by_this_explanation","abstract":"In document analysis, an important task is to automatically find keywords which best describe the subject of the document. One of the most widely used techniques for keyword detection is a technique based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) heuristic. This techniques has some explanations, but these explanations are somewhat too complex to be fully convincing. In this paper, we provide a simple probabilistic explanation for the tf-idf heuristic. We also show that the ideas behind explanation can help us come up with more complex formulas which will hopefully lead to a more adequate detection of keywords.","authors":["Lukáš Havrlant","Vladik Kreinovich"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of General Systems 46(1):27-36","DOI:10.1080/03081079.2017.1291635"],"references":["238123710_Understanding_Inverse_Document_Frequency_On_Theoretical_Arguments_for_IDF","220387577_A_probabilistic_justification_for_using_tfidf_term_weighting_in_information_retrieval","319394494_Handbook_of_Mathematical_Functions_with_Formulas_Graphs_and_Mathematical_Tables","308161218_Introduction_to_information_retrieval_chapt","301690162_A_statistical_interpretation_of_term_specificity_and_its_application_in_retrieval","287713097_Handbook_of_Mathematical_Functions_with_Formulas_Graphs_and_Mathematical_Tables_US_Department_of_Commerce_Washington_DC","280113442_Mining_of_Massive_Datasets","274869757_Handbook_of_Parametric_and_Nonparametric_Statistical_Procedures","235276596_Jones_KS_A_Statistical_Interpretation_of_Term_Specificity_and_its_Application_in_Retrieval_Journal_of_Documentation_281_11-21","200045867_An_Introduction_to_Information_Retrieval_DRAFT"]}
