{"id":"347887254_Super-machines_or_sub-humans_Mental_models_and_trust_in_intelligent_autonomous_systems","abstract":"Intelligent autonomous systems surpass human-information processing capabilities, potentially mitigating cognitive workload imposed by tasking and micromanagement of systems, and afford the use of advanced algorithms, machine learning, and big data to enhance decision-making. This functionality can support teamworking activities, but also introduces new human factor challenges; these include the complexity of systems functioning, needs for teamwork on top of taskwork, stress resulting from cognitive overload, uncertainty, and loss of decision-making authority. The chapter explores the idea that the operator's mental model for the IAS may be a critical influence on trust. The mental model allows for prediction and explanation of outcomes, and exerts a major influence on team processes. Machine speech can be used to build trust and help humans to understand the machine's intentions and team support. System design and training may be tailored to accommodate or remediate the individual operator's attitudes and biases regarding intelligent systems.","authors":["Gerald Matthews","April Rose Panganiban","Jinchao Lin","Michael D.
