{"id":"3187265_Noninterference_monitoring_and_replay_mechanism_for_real-time_software_testing_and_debugging","abstract":"A noninterference monitoring and replay mechanism using the\nrecorded execution history of a program to control the replay of the\nprogram behavior and guarantee the reproduction of its errors is\npresented. Based on this approach, a noninterference monitoring\narchitecture has been developed to collect the program execution data of\na target real-time software system without affecting its execution. A\nreplay mechanism designed to control the reproduction of the program\nbehavior as well as the examination of the states of the target system\nand its behavior is presented. The monitoring system has been\nimplemented using a Motorola 68000 computer in a Unix system\nenvironment. An example is used to illustrate how the mechanism detects\ntiming errors of real-time software systems","authors":["Jeffrey J P Tsai","KY Fang","HY Chen","Y.-D.
