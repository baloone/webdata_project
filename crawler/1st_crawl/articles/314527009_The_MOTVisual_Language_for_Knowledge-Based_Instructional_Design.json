{"id":"314527009_The_MOTVisual_Language_for_Knowledge-Based_Instructional_Design","abstract":"This chapter states and explains that a Learning Design is the result of a knowledge engineering process where knowledge and competencies, learning design, media and delivery models are constructed in an integrated framework. Consequently, we present our MOT+ general graphical language and editor that help construct structured interrelated visual models. The MOT+LD editor is the newly added specialization of this editor for learning designs, producing IMS-LD compliant Units of Learning. The MOT+OWL editor is another specialization of the general visual language for knowledge and competency models based on the OWL specification. We situate both models within our taxonomy of knowledge models respectively as a multi-actor collaborative process and a domain theory. The association between these “content” models and learning design components is seen as the essential task in an instructional design methodology, to guide the construction of high quality learning environments.","authors":["Gilbert Paquette","Michel Léonard","Karin Lundgren-Cayrol"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.4018/9781599047294.ch008","In book: Handbook of Visual Languages for Instructional Design"],"references":[]}
