{"id":"228605587_Algorithmic_Prediction_of_Health_Care_Costs_and_Discovery_of_Medical_Knowledge","abstract":"Rising health care costs are one of the world's most important problems. Correspondingly, predicting such costs with accuracy is a significant first step in addressing this problem. Since the 1980s, there have been research efforts for predictive modeling of medical costs based on claims data that utilize heuristic rules and regression methods that have not been appropriately validated using populations that the methods have not seen. We utilize modern data mining methods, specifically classification trees and clustering algorithms, and claims data from close to 400,000 members over three years, to provide a)rigorously validated predictions of health care costs in the third year, based on medical and cost data from the first two years and b) an illustration through examples, involving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents on one hand and estrogen and antidepressants on the other, that our meth-ods can lead to discovery of medical knowledge. We quantify the accuracy of our predictions using unseen (out-of-sample) data from over 100,000 members. The key findings are: a) our data mining methods provide accurate predictions of medical costs and represent a powerful tool for prediction of health care costs, b) the pattern of past cost data are strong predictors of future costs, c) medical 1 information contributes to accurate prediction of medical costs particularly on high risk members, and d) new medical knowledge can be obtained through our methods.","authors":["Dimitris Bertsimas","Margrét V.
