{"id":"276115246_Using_Eye_Trackers_for_Usability_Evaluation_of_Health_Information_Technology_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Background\nEye-tracking technology has been used to measure human cognitive processes and has the potential to improve the usability of health information technology (HIT). However, it is still unclear how the eye-tracking method can be integrated with other traditional usability methodologies to achieve its full potential.\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this study was to report on HIT evaluation studies that have used eye-tracker technology, and to envision the potential use of eye-tracking technology in future research.\n\nMethods\nWe used four reference databases to initially identify 5248 related papers, which resulted in only 9 articles that met our inclusion criteria.\n\nResults\nEye-tracking technology was useful in finding usability problems in many ways, but is still in its infancy for HIT usability evaluation. Limited types of HITs have been evaluated by eye trackers, and there has been a lack of evaluation research in natural settings.\n\nConclusions\nMore research should be done in natural settings to discover the real contextual-based usability problems of clinical and mobile HITs using eye-tracking technology with more standardized methodologies and guidance.","authors":["Onur Asan","Yushi
