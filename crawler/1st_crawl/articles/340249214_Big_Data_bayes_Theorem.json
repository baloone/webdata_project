{"id":"340249214_Big_Data_bayes_Theorem","abstract":"The paper presents a brief introduction to big data\nand its role in educational and learning applications. It is\npragmatic that the use of big data architecture and techniques\nare continuously support in managing the speedy data growth\nin educational industry. Here, initially an experimental study is\nperformed to analyze the role of big data in educational\nindustry. It has been observed that important work has been\ndone using big data in educational and learning. Nowadays, it\nis involved the based mathematics that has been increasingly\nused in artificial intelligence applications of computer science\nis “probability based decision making.” The decision making\n(if, if-else, switch-case) based upon randomly generated\nnumerical values. At the university and applied level we see\ndecisions being made based upon more sophisticated criteria.\nA major part of this work is predicated upon knowledge of\nBayes’ Theorem. Here, a novel design of analyze the student’s\nperformance like to cross checking their assignments using the\nbayes theorem and its advanced mechanism to proposed to\nhandle the big data of educational industry involving\n“probability based decision making.”","authors":["Nasurudeen Ahamed N"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Scientific Research and Advances 5(10):1695-1697","DOI:10.4061/2011"],"references":["228419864_Some_Applications_of_Bayes'_Rule_in_Probability_Theory_to_Electrocatalytic_Reaction_Engineering"]}
