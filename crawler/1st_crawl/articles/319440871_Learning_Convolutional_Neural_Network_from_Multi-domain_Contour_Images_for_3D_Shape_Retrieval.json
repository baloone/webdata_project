{"id":"319440871_Learning_Convolutional_Neural_Network_from_Multi-domain_Contour_Images_for_3D_Shape_Retrieval","abstract":"Recent vision-brain physiological experiments [65] have demonstrated that contours, and in particular, contour junctions present in the 2D images are very informative for revealing the 3D structure of the object. Inspired by this observation, we take 2D sketches (or 2D views of 3D sketches) and edge maps of 2D views of 3D models as a unified domain to train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN features are then used for 3D object representation. We show that the CNN can successfully learn the object structure from different types of clues. The performance of the proposed method demonstrates that the semantic gap between the 2D/3D sketches and the 3D models can be bridged without any cross-domain similarity learning. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2D/3D sketch-based 3D retrieval methods.","authors":["Zongxiao Zhu","Cong Rao","Song Bai","Longin Jan Latecki"],"meta":["September 2017Pattern Recognition Letters 119(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.patrec.2017.08.028"],"references":["317191078_Deep_Aggregation_of_Local_3D_Geometric_Features_for_3D_Model_Retrieval","311610600_GIFT_A_Real-Time_and_Scalable_3D_Shape_Search_Engine","309402776_Learning_a_Probabilistic_Latent_Space_of_Object_Shapes_via_3D_Generative-Adversarial_Modeling","307515952_Self-restraint_object_recognition_by_model_based_CNN_learning","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","303699294_SHREC'16_Track_Large-Scale_3D_Shape_Retrieval_from_ShapeNet_Core55","301927337_GIFT_A_Real-time_and_Scalable_3D_Shape_Search_Engine","301484938_SHREC'16_Track_Partial_Shape_Queries_for_3D_Object_Retrieval","301197981_Efficient_Globally_Optimal_2D-to-3D_Deformable_Shape_Matching","282211796_DeepSketch_Deep_convolutional_neural_networks_for_sketch_recognition_and_similarity_search","280305180_Sketch-a-Net_that_Beats_Humans","278242900_Sketch_Classification_and_Classification-driven_Analysis_Using_Fisher_Vectors","272819576_Sketch-Based_Shape_Retrieval","263899589_Shape_Vocabulary_A_Robust_and_Efficient_Shape_Representation_for_Shape_Matching","262104554_SHREC'14_Track_Extended_Large_Scale_Sketch-Based_3D_Shape_Retrieval","261081048_Ranking_on_Cross-Domain_Manifold_for_Sketch-Based_3D_Model_Retrieval","255976217_Fast_and_Robust_2D-Shape_Extraction_Using_Discrete-Point_Sampling_and_Centerline_Grouping_in_Complex_Images","254461838_How_Do_Humans_Sketch_Objects","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","236985005_KAZE_Features","236018237_SHREC'12_track_Sketch-based_3D_shape_retrieval","234788757_Distance_metric_learning_and_feature_combination_for_shape-based_3D_model_retrieval","332814124_Orientation-boosted_Voxel_Nets_for_3D_Object_Recognition","316644575_Learning_cross-domain_neural_networks_for_sketch-based_3D_shape_retrieval","314779249_How_do_humans_sketch_objects","311610544_Pairwise_Decomposition_of_Image_Sequences_for_Active_Multi-view_Recognition","308843426_Sketch-based_3D_shape_retrieval_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","307822569_Understanding_deep_image_representations_by_inverting_them","305218182_The_sketchy_database_learning_to_retrieve_badly_drawn_bunnies","303714400_Food_Image_Recognition_Using_Covariance_of_Convolutional_Layer_Feature_Maps","303545446_Pairwise_Decomposition_of_Image_Sequences_for_Active_Multi-View_Recognition","303168489_Robust_point_matching_via_vector_field_consensus","303095662_Deep_Sketch_Feature_for_Cross-domain_Image_Retrieval","301687044_Contour_junctions_underlie_neural_representations_of_scene_categories_in_high-level_human_visual_cortex_Contour_junctions_underlie_neural_code_of_scenes","290741189_H_Pal_information_entropy_based_combination_methods_for_3D_model_retrieval","281082006_Non-Rigid_Point_Set_Registration_by_Preserving_Global_and_Local_Structures","275974673_Multi-view_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_3D_Shape_Recognition","273399906_Free-hand_Sketch_Recognition_by_Multi-Kernel_Feature_Learning","273176803_Robust_L2E_Estimation_of_Transformation_for_Non-Rigid_Registration","269250098_Sketch_Recognition_by_Ensemble_Matching_of_Structured_Features","269040983_Understanding_Deep_Image_Representations_by_Inverting_Them","268186335_Sketch-based_3D_Model_Retrieval_using_Keyshapes_for_Global_and_Local_Representation","267760711_A_comparison_of_3D_shape_retrieval_methods_based_on_a_large-scale_benchmark_supporting_multimodal_queries","261462152_A_large-scale_Shape_Benchmark_for_3D_object_retrieval_Toyohashi_shape_benchmark","261265674_3D_shape_retrieval_focused_on_holes_and_surface_roughness","260604425_Robust_Point_Matching_via_Vector_Field_Consensus","259960988_Nonaccidental_Properties_Underlie_Human_Categorization_of_Complex_Natural_Scenes","259602851_Sketch-Based_3D_Model_Retrieval_by_Viewpoint_Entropy-Based_Adaptive_View_Clustering","230745561_A_comparison_of_methods_for_non-rigid_3D_shape_retrieval","227131771_3D_model_retrieval_using_hybrid_features_and_class_information","224207497_Sketch-Based_Image_Retrieval_Benchmark_and_Bag-of-Features_Descriptors","224164326_Aggregating_local_descriptors_into_a_compact_image_representation","221751821_Scale-Invariant_Features_for_3-D_Mesh_Models","221369067_Dense_sampling_and_fast_encoding_for_3D_model_retrieval_using_bag-of-visual_features","221369111_Representing_shape_with_a_spatial_pyramid_kernel"]}
