{"id":"256537362_Arabase_A_Database_Combining_Different_Arabic_Resources_with_Lexical_and_Semantic_Information","abstract":"Language resources are important factor in any NLP application. However, the language resource support for Arabic is poor because the existing Arabic language resources are either scattered, inconsistent or even incomplete. In this paper we discuss the notion of having an integrated Arabic resource leveraging various pre-existing ones. We present a comparison between these resources then we present preliminary fully and semi-automated methods to integrate these resources. This work serves as a bootstrapping for a rich Arabic- Arabic resource with a good potential to interface with WordNet.","authors":["Hazem Raafat","Mohamed A. Zahran","Mohsen A.
