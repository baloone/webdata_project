{"id":"281229106_As_Politicas_Publicas_de_Acesso_e_Difusao_da_Cultura_no_Brasil_e_o_Caso_do_Programa_Nacional_de_Apoio_a_Cultura","abstract":"This paper will examine the National Culture Support Program – NCSP, established by Law no 8.313/91, one of the main financing instruments of artistic and cultural events and promotion of cultural rights in Brazil. This policy was drafted during the presidency of Fernando Collor de Mello, which was marked by neoliberal trends that favored private initiative. Accordingly, the main mechanism of the NCSP is the Cultural Patronage, through which individuals can contribute with donations or sponsorships to finance cultural projects, and later obtain deductions from income tax. After an identification of the problems faced by the program, the paper will discuss the later developments of the matter in the country, pointing the way for a possible solution.","authors":["Telma Rocha Lisowski"],"meta":["June 2015Revista Brasileira de Políticas Públicas 5(1)","DOI:10.5102/rbpp.v5i1.3098"],"references":["237587102_Politicas_Culturais_no_Brasil_balanco_e_perspectivas"]}
