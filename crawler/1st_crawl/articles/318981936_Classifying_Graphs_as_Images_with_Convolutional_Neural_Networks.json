{"id":"318981936_Classifying_Graphs_as_Images_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"The task of graph classification is currently dominated by graph kernels, which, while powerful, scale poorly to large graphs and datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a very appealing alternative. However, feeding graphs to CNNs is not trivial. To address this challenge, many sophisticated extensions of CNNs have recently been proposed. In this paper, we show that a classical 2D CNN architecture designed for images can also be used for graph processing in a completely off-the-shelf manner; the only prerequisite being to encode graphs as stacks of two-dimensional histograms of their node embeddings. Despite its simplicity, our method proves very competitive to state-of-the-art graph kernels, and even outperforms them by a wide margin on some datasets.","authors":["Antoine J.-P.
