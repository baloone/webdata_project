{"id":"247498670_The_role_of_self-efficacy_beliefs_in_student_engagement_and_learning_in_the_classroom","abstract":"Student motivation is an important concern for all teachers. Recent research on student motivation has provided evidence for the development of important constructs and generalizations that have direct application to the classroom. Although there are many motivational constructs, self-efficacy is one that is key to promoting students' engagement and learning. Self-efficacy is discussed in terms of how it may facilitate behavioral, cognitive, and motivational engagement in the classroom. Specific suggestions for teacher practice are also provided.","authors":["Elizabeth A. Linnenbrink","Paul R.
