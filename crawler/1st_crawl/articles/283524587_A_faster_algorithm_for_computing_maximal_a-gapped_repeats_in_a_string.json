{"id":"283524587_A_faster_algorithm_for_computing_maximal_a-gapped_repeats_in_a_string","abstract":"A string \\(x = uvu\\) with both u, v being non-empty is called a gapped repeat with period \\(p = |uv|\\), and is denoted by pair (x, p). If \\(p \\le \\alpha (|x|-p)\\) with \\(\\alpha > 1\\), then (x, p) is called an \\(\\alpha \\)\n-gapped repeat. An occurrence \\([i, i+|x|-1]\\) of an \\(\\alpha \\)-gapped repeat (x, p) in a string w is called a maximal \\(\\alpha \\)-gapped repeat of w, if it cannot be extended either to the left or to the right in w with the same period p. Kolpakov et al. (CPM 2014) showed that, given a string of length n over a constant alphabet, all the occurrences of maximal \\(\\alpha \\)-gapped repeats in the string can be computed in \\(O(\\alpha ^2 n + occ )\\) time, where \\( occ \\) is the number of occurrences. In this paper, we propose a faster \\(O(\\alpha n + occ )\\)-time algorithm to solve this problem, improving the result of Kolpakov et al. by a factor of \\(\\alpha \\).","authors":["Yuka Tanimura","Yuta Fujishige","I.
