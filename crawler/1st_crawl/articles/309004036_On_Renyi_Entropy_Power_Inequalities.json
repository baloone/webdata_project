{"id":"309004036_On_Renyi_Entropy_Power_Inequalities","abstract":"This paper gives improved Renyi entropy power inequalities (R-EPIs). Consider a sum Sn = Pn k=1 Xk of n independent continuous random vectors taking values on Rd, and let 2 [1;1]. An R-EPI provides a lower bound on the order- Renyi entropy power of Sn that, up to a multiplicative constant (which may depend in general on n; ; d), is equal to the sum of the order- Renyi entropy powers of the n random vectors fXkgnk =1. For = 1, the R-EPI coincides with the well-known entropy power inequality by Shannon. The first improved R-EPI is obtained by tightening the recent R-EPI by Bobkov and Chistyakov which relies on the sharpened Young’s inequality. A further improvement of the R-EPI also relies on convex optimization and results on rank-one modification of a real-valued diagonal matrix.","authors":["Eshed Ram","Igal Sason"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2016.2616135","Project: On Rényi entropy power inequalities"],"references":["308872696_A_discrete_entropy_power_inequality_for_uniform_distributions","301877216_Forward_and_Reverse_Entropy_Power_Inequalities_in_Convex_Geometry","269269636_A_lower_bound_on_the_Renyi_entropy_of_convolutions_in_the_integers","309628090_Entropy_Bounds_on_Abelian_Groups_and_the_Ruzsa_Divergence","306116257_Reverse_entropy_power_inequalities_for_s-concave_densities","306115033_Strengthening_the_entropy_power_inequality","301856680_Strengthening_the_Entropy_Power_Inequality","273394848_On_the_Conditional_Renyi_Entropy","273391782_Entropy_Power_Inequality_for_the_Renyi_Entropy","271952166_Bounds_on_the_Maximum_of_the_Density_for_Sums_of_Independent_Random_Variables"]}
