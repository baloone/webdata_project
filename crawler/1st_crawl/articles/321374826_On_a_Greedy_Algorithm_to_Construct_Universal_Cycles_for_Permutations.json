{"id":"321374826_On_a_Greedy_Algorithm_to_Construct_Universal_Cycles_for_Permutations","abstract":"A universal cycle for permutations of length n is a cyclic word or permutation, any factor of which is order-isomorphic to exactly one permutation of length n, and containing all permutations of length n as factors. It is well known that universal cycles for permutations of length n exist. However, all known ways to construct such cycles are rather complicated. For example, in the original paper establishing the existence of the universal cycles, constructing such a cycle involves finding an Eulerian cycle in a certain graph and then dealing with partially ordered sets.\nIn this paper, we offer a simple way to generate a universal cycle for permutations of length n, which is based on applying a greedy algorithm to a permutation of length n−1. We prove that this approach gives a unique universal cycle Πn for permutations, and we study properties of Πn.","authors":["Alice L. L. Gao","Sergey Kitaev","Philip B.
