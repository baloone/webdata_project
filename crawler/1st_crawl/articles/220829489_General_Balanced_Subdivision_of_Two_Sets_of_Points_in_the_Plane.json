{"id":"220829489_General_Balanced_Subdivision_of_Two_Sets_of_Points_in_the_Plane","abstract":"Let R and B be two disjoint sets of red points and blue points, respectively, in the plane such that no three points of R ∪ B are co-linear. Suppose ag ≤ |R| ≤ (a + 1)g, bg ≤ |B| ≤ (b + 1)g. Then without loss of generality, we can express |R| = a(g\n1 + g\n2) + (a + 1)g\n3, |B| = bg\n1 + (b + 1)(g\n2 + g\n3), where g = g\n1 + g\n2 + g\n3, g\n1 ≥ 0, g\n2 ≥ 0, g\n3 ≥ 0 and g\n1 + g\n2 + g\n3 ≥ 1. We show that the plane can be subdivided into g disjoint convex polygons \nX1È¼ÈXg1ÈY1È¼ÈYg2ÈZ1È¼ÈZg3X_{1}\\cup \\cdots \\cup X_{g_1}\\cup Y_{1}\\cup \\cdots \\cup Y_{g_2}\\cup Z_{1}\\cup \\cdots \\cup Z_{g_3}\nsuch that every X\n\ni\ncontains a red points and b blue points, every Y\n\ni\ncontains a red points and b + 1 blue points and every Z\n\ni\ncontains a + 1 red points and b + 1 blue points.","authors":["M.
