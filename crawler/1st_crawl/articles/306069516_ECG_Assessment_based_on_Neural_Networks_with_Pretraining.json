{"id":"306069516_ECG_Assessment_based_on_Neural_Networks_with_Pretraining","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new automatic screening method to assess whether a patient from ambulatory care or emergency should be referred to a cardiology service. This method is based on deep neural networks with pretraining and takes as an input a raw ECG signal without annotation.","authors":["Vicent Ribas","Anna Wojdel","Enrique Romero","Pablo Ramos"],"meta":["August 2016Applied Soft Computing 49","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2016.08.013"],"references":["303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","267339744_Trends_in_Extreme_Learning_Machines_A_Review","259525932_Cardiac_Arrhythmia_Classification_Using_Neural_Networks_with_Selected_Features","239571798_Information_processing_in_dynamical_systems_Foundations_of_harmony_theory","237060099_Innovative_continuous_non-invasive_cuffless_blood_pressure_monitoring_based_on_photoplethysmography_technology","228059497_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","222299892_Personalized_long-term_ECG_classification_A_systematic_approach","221346269_Extracting_and_composing_robust_features_with_denoising_autoencoders","220320806_Why_Does_Unsupervised_Pre-training_Help_Deep_Learning","220319875_Why_Does_Unsupervised_Pre-training_Help_Deep_Learning","220217592_An_expert_system_for_automated_recognition_of_patients_with_obstructive_sleep_apnea_using_electrocardiogram_recordings","215991023_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI","26843936_Integration_Of_Fcm_Pca_And_Neural_Networks_For_Classification_Of_Ecg_Arrhythmias","7299575_Comparative_study_of_morphological_and_time-frequency_ECG_descriptors_for_heartbeat_classification","6928613_Universal_Approximation_Using_Incremental_Constructive_Feedforward_Networks_With_Random_Hidden_Nodes","319770626_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770174_Practical_recommendations_for_gradient-based_training_of_deep_architectures","312370418_Using_deep_belief_nets_to_learn_covariance_kernels_for_Gaussian_processes","306177437_A_comprehensive_foundation","304109482_Training_products_of_experts_by_minimizing_contrastive_divergence","282956192_Comparison_between_ANN-Based_Heart_Stroke_Classifiers_Using_Varied_Folds_Data_Set_Cross-Validation","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262008636_Automated_diagnosis_of_Coronary_Artery_Disease_affected_patients_using_LDA_PCA_ICA_and_Discrete_Wavelet_Transform","259054286_Application_of_higher_order_statistics_for_atrial_arrhythmia_classification","239582331_Stochastic_Relaxation_Gibbs_Distributions_and_the_Bayesian_Resoration_of_Images","229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors","222409682_A_qualitative_comparison_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_and_Support_Vector_Machines_in_ECG_arrhythmias_classification","221663833_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","221619441_Using_Deep_Belief_Nets_to_Learn_Covariance_Kernels_for_Gaussian_Processes","220219781_Robust_multiple_cardiac_arrhythmia_detection_through_bispectrum_analysis","220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741","49594511_Classification_of_ECG_Signals_Using_Extreme_Learning_Machine","47793922_Remote_Health_Monitoring_of_Heart_Failure_With_Data_Mining_via_CART_Method_on_HRV_Features","46124120_A_Classification_Tree_Approach_for_Cardiac_Ischemia_Detection_Using_Spatiotemporal_Information_From_Three_Standard_ECG_Leads","37419815_An_introduction_to_support_vector_machines_and_other_kernel-based_learning_methods_Repr","23931787_Modelling_temporal_evolution_of_cardiac_electrophysiological_features_using_Hidden_Semi-Markov_Models","11207765_ARTICLE_Training_Products_of_Experts_by_Minimizing_Contrastive_Divergence","7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","5388313_Incremental_HMM_training_applied_to_ECG_signal_analysis"]}
