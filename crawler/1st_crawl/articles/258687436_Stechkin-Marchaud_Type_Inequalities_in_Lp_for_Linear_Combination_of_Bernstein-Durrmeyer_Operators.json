{"id":"258687436_Stechkin-Marchaud_Type_Inequalities_in_Lp_for_Linear_Combination_of_Bernstein-Durrmeyer_Operators","abstract":"We use the equivalence relation between K-functional and modulus of smoothness, and give the Stechkin-Marchaud-type inequalities for linear combination of Bernstein-Durrmeyer operators. Moreover, we obtain the inverse result of approximation for linear combination of Bernstein-Durrmeyer operators with ω φ λ 2r (f;x). Meanwhile we unify and extend some previous results.","authors":["Feng Guo"],"meta":["January 2012Far East Journal of Mathematical Sciences 2(04):228-232","DOI:10.4236/ojapps.2012.24B052"],"references":["302407779_Weighted_Moduli_of_Smoothness","265580973_Approximation_by_linear_combinations_of_Bernstein-Durrmeyer_operators","265366403_On_Smoothness_Characterized_by_Bernstein_Type_Operators","245584022_Bernstein_type_operators_and_their_derivatives","242815627_On_multivariate_approximation_by_Bernstein-type_polynomials","223147380_Weak-type_inequalities_for_Kantorovitch_polynomials_and_related_operators"]}
