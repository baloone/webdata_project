{"id":"332263887_Some_remarks_on_State_Estimation_and_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Time_Labeled_Petri_Net_Systems_with_Unobservable_Transitions''","abstract":"In this paper we comment on the algorithm proposed in the paper mentioned in the title to define and construct a graph, called Modified State Class Graph (MSCG), which summarizes all possible evolutions of a Time Petri net. We first show that\nunder the assumptions mentioned in such a paper, the proposed\ngraph could be infinite. Then, we underline the requirement of\nrevising the notation and adding some information on certain\nedges of the graph. Finally, we remark that the current version of\nthe algorithm does not consider all possible evolutions of the net\nsystem. In the final part of the manuscript we propose a revised\nalgorithm for the definition and construction of the MSCG that\novercomes all such limitations.","authors":["Zhou He","Zhiwu Li","Alessandro Giua","Francesco Basile"],"meta":["December 2019IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 64:1-8","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2019.2910168"],"references":["305037331_Diagnosability_Analysis_of_Labeled_Time_Petri_Net_Systems","285842809_Petri_Nets_Properties_Analysis_and_Applications","274013925_State_Estimation_and_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Labeled_Time_Petri_Net_Systems_With_Unobservable_Transitions"]}
