{"id":"323118778_The_Effect_of_IoT_New_Features_on_Security_and_Privacy_New_Threats_Existing_Solutions_and_Challenges_Yet_to_Be_Solved","abstract":"The future of Internet of Things (IoT) is already upon us. IoT applications have been widely used in many field of social production and social living such as healthcare, energy and industrial automation. While enjoying the convenience and efficiency that IoT brings to us, new threats from IoT also have emerged. There are increasing research works to ease these threats, but many problems remain open. To better understand the essential reasons of new threats and the challenges in current research, this survey first proposes the concept of \"IoT features\". Then, the security and privacy effects of eight IoT new features were discussed including the threats they cause, existing solutions and challenges yet to be solved. To help researchers follow the up-to-date works in this field, this paper finally illustrates the developing trend of IoT security research and reveals how IoT features affect existing security research by investigating most existing research works related to IoT security from 2013 to 2017.","authors":["Wei Zhou","Yuqing Zhang","Peng Liu"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE Internet of Things Journal PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/JIOT.2018.2847733"],"references":["318288727_DDoS_in_the_IoT_Mirai_and_other_botnets","318153053_Security_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems","316173391_A_Survey_on_Security_and_Privacy_Issues_in_Internet-of-Things","299421725_The_Internet_of_Things_a_security_point_of_view","282375085_Communication_security_in_internet_of_thing_Preventive_measure_and_avoid_DDoS_attack_over_IoT_network","272385802_Low-Energy_Security_Limits_and_Opportunities_in_the_Internet_of_Things","270107935_Security_privacy_and_trust_in_Internet_of_Things_The_road_ahead","266178170_SMART_Secure_and_Minimal_Architecture_for_Establishing_a_Dynamic_Root_of_Trust","262056560_Internet_of_Things_for_Enterprise_Systems_of_Modern_Manufacturing","254043041_Slender_PUF_Protocol_A_Lightweight_Robust_and_Secure_Authentication_by_Substring_Matching","224265194_ARMor_Fully_Verified_Software_Fault_Isolation","323248808_Securing_Real-Time_Microcontroller_Systems_through_Customized_Memory_View_Switching","320794928_Smart_Solution_Poor_Protection_An_Empirical_Study_of_Security_and_Privacy_Issues_in_Developing_and_Deploying_Smart_Home_Devices","317922666_Protecting_Bare-Metal_Embedded_Systems_with_Privilege_Overlays","317633298_TrustShadow_Secure_Execution_of_Unmodified_Applications_with_ARM_TrustZone","317004859_From_Physical_to_Cyber_Escalating_Protection_for_Personalized_Auto_Insurance","316904631_Towards_Automated_Dynamic_Analysis_for_Linux-based_Embedded_Firmware","315526619_A_Secure_Mechanism_for_Big_Data_Collection_in_Large_Scale_Internet_of_Vehicle","315302131_A_Survey_on_Internet_of_Things_Architecture_Enabling_Technologies_Security_and_Privacy_and_Applications","311865887_Mapping_the_internet_of_things","310124228_KEH-Gait_Towards_a_Mobile_Healthcare_User_Authentication_System_by_Kinetic_Energy_Harvesting","306301864_Security_Analysis_of_Emerging_Smart_Home_Applications","305880465_Is_Anybody_Home_Inferring_Activity_From_Smart_Home_Network_Traffic","303515408_High-Performance_and_Lightweight_Lattice-Based_Public-Key_Encryption","301461608_Handling_a_trillion_unfixable_flaws_on_a_billion_devices_Rethinking_network_security_for_the_Internet-of-Things","299466964_Through_the_eye_of_the_PLC","276127152_Trust-Based_Service_Management_for_Social_Internet_of_Things_Systems","271715397_Camouflage_Traffic_Minimizing_Message_Delay_for_Smart_Grid_Applications_under_Jamming","262409553_Sancus_low-cost_trustworthy_extensible_networked_devices_with_a_zero-software_trusted_computing_base","262351709_Minimizing_private_data_disclosures_in_the_smart_grid","262271999_FIE_on_firmware_finding_vulnerabilities_in_embedded_systems_using_symbolic_execution","261567340_CP-ABE_With_Constant-Size_Keys_for_Lightweight_Devices","261500400_Verified_Computational_Differential_Privacy_with_Applications_to_Smart_Metering","257582417_On_the_features_and_challenges_of_security_and_privacy_in_distributed_Internet_of_things","220496976_Stuxnet_Dissecting_a_Cyberwarfare_Weapon"]}
