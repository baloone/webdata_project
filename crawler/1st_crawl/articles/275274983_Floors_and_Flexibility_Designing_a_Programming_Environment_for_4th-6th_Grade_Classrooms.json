{"id":"275274983_Floors_and_Flexibility_Designing_a_Programming_Environment_for_4th-6th_Grade_Classrooms","abstract":"The recent renaissance in early computer science education has provided K-12 teachers with multiple options for introducing children to computer science. However, tools for teaching programming for children with wide-scale adoption have been targeted mostly at pre-readers or middle school and higher grade-levels. This leaves a gap for 4th -- 6th grade students, who differ developmentally from older and younger students.\nIn this paper, we investigate block-based programming languages targeted at elementary and middle school students and demonstrate a gap in existing programming languages appropriate for 4th -- 6th grade classrooms. We analyze the benefits of Scratch, ScratchJr, and Blockly for students and curriculum developers. We describe the design principles we created based on our experiences using block-based programming in 4th -- 6th grade classrooms, and introduce LaPlaya, a language and development environment designed specifically for children in the gap between grades K-3 and middle school students.","authors":["Charlotte Hill","Hilary Dwyer","Tim Martinez","Danielle Boyd Harlow"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1145/2676723.2677275","Conference: SIGCSE 15"],"references":["262355492_Some_Grand_challenges_of_computer_science_education_in_the_digital_age_A_socio-cultural_perspective","250455595_Effects_of_web_based_tutoring_software_on_students'_math_achievement","234820368_The_Scratch_Programming_Language_and_Environment","234801355_Animal_tlatoque_Attracting_middle_school_students_to_computing_through_culturally-relevant_themes","288042361_Hci_for_Kids","271468572_Setting_the_scene_Scaffolding_stories_to_benefit_middle_school_students_learning_to_program","269031203_Making_the_connection","262389338_Assessment_of_computer_science_learning_in_a_scratch-based_outreach_program","262253499_Designing_ScratchJr_support_for_early_childhood_learning_through_computer_programming","262252186_Snap_build_your_own_blocks_tutorial_presentation"]}
