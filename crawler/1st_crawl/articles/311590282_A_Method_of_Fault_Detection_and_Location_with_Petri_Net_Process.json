{"id":"311590282_A_Method_of_Fault_Detection_and_Location_with_Petri_Net_Process","abstract":"Petri net is an effective tool to analyze the operating rules of the system. Petri net process can reflect the feature of the system fault propagation. Construction and definition method of Petri net fault detection process is presented and the fault performance features in the Petri net process are analyzed. Based on the above research foundation, a method of fault detection and location with Petri net process is presented. Firstly, Petri net model with input and output for fault detection is given. Then fault detection and location method with this model is described in detail. Finally, an example of fault detection in sequential circuit is given to verify the correctness of the method.","authors":["De-qin SHU","Hao FAN","Liang ZHANG","Cheng-ming ZHANG"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1142/9789813146426_0005","Conference: The International Conference on Computer Science and Technology (CST2016)"],"references":[]}
