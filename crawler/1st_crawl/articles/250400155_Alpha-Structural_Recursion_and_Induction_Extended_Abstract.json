{"id":"250400155_Alpha-Structural_Recursion_and_Induction_Extended_Abstract","abstract":"There is growing evidence for the usefulness of name permutations when dealing with syntax involving names and name-binding. In particular they facilitate an attractively simple formalisation of common, but often technically incorrect uses of structural recursion and induction for abstract syntax trees mod- ulo -equivalence. At the heart of this formalisation is the notion of nitely sup- ported mathematical objects. This paper explains the idea in as concrete a way as possible and gives a new derivation within higher-order logic of principles of -structural recursion and induction for -equivalence classes from the ordinary versions of these principles for abstract syntax trees.","authors":["Andrew M.
