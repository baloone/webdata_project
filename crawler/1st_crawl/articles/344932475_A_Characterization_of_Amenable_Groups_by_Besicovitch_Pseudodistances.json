{"id":"344932475_A_Characterization_of_Amenable_Groups_by_Besicovitch_Pseudodistances","abstract":"The Besicovitch pseudodistance defined in [Blanchard, Formenti and Kurka, 1999] for one-dimensional configurations is invariant by translations. We generalize the definition to arbitrary countable groups and study how properties of the pseudodistance, including invariance by translations, are determined by those of the sequence of finite sets used to define it. In particular, we recover that if the Besicovitch pseudodistance comes from a nondecreasing exhaustive Følner sequence, then every shift is an isometry. For non-Følner sequences we prove that some shifts are not isometries, and the Besicovitch pseudodistance with respect to some subsequence even makes them non-continuous.","authors":["Silvio Capobianco","Pierre Guillon","Camille Noûs"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-61588-8_8","Conference: AUTOMATA 2020At: Stockholm, Sweden (held online)"],"references":["352411234_Besicovitch_Pseudodistances_with_Respect_to_Non-Folner_Sequences","264932675_Surjective_cellular_automata_far_from_the_Garden_of_Eden","2818674_Cellular_automata_in_the_Cantor_Besicovitch_and_Weyl_spaces","285850085_Cellular_automata_in_the_Cantor_Besicovitch_and_Weyl_topological_spaces","230641324_An_Introduction_to_Symbolic_Dynamics_and_Coding","47463203_Cellular_Automata_and_Groups","1889033_Surjunctivity_for_Cellular_Automata_in_Besicovitch_Spaces"]}
