{"id":"317525547_Emotional_Attachment_Performance_and_Viability_in_Teams_Collaborating_with_Embodied_Physical_Action_EPA_Robots","abstract":"Although teams are increasingly employing embodied physical action (EPA) robots as a collaborative technology to accomplish their work, we know very little about what makes such teams successful. This paper has two objectives: the first is to examine whether a team's emotional attachment to its robots can lead to better team performance and viability; the second is to determine whether robot and team identification can promote a team's emotional attachment to its robots. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a between-subjects experiment with 57 teams working with robots. Teams performed better and were more viable when they were emotionally attached to their robots. Both robot and team identification increased a team's emotional attachment to its robots. Results of this study have implications for collaboration using EPA robots specifically and for collaboration technology in general. We would like to thank Michelle Carter, Jaime Windeler and Binny Samuel for their useful comments.","authors":["Sangseok You","Lionel P.
