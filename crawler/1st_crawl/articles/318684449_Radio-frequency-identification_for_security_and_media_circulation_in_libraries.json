{"id":"318684449_Radio-frequency-identification_for_security_and_media_circulation_in_libraries","abstract":"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Systems have been in use in libraries for five years for book identification, for self checkout, for anti-theft control, for inventory control, and for the sorting and conveying of library books and AV materials. These applications can lead to significant savings in labor costs, enhance customer service, lower book theft and provide a constant record update of media collections. In this paper, the technical features of a modern RFID system are described to provide a guideline for the evaluation of different systems. The most important result is that non-proprietary systems can be used for libraries today since the new generation of RFID chips with the ISO standard 15693 are available. With this technology, libraries are not dependent on one company for their lifeline.","authors":["E. Erwin","C.
