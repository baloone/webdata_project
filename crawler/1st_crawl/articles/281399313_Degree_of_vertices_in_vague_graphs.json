{"id":"281399313_Degree_of_vertices_in_vague_graphs","abstract":"A vague graph is a generalized structure of a fuzzy graph that gives more precision, flexibility and compatibility to a system when compared with systems that are designed using fuzzy graphs. In this paper, we\ndefine two new operation on vague graphs namely normal product and tensor product and study about the degree of a vertex in vague graphs which are obtained from two given vague graphs G1 and G2 using the operations Cartesian product, composition, tensor product and normal product. These operations are highly utilized by computer science, geometry, algebra, number theory and operation research. In addition to the existing operations these properties will also be helpful to study large vague graph as a combination of small, vague graphs and to derive its properties from those of the smaller ones.","authors":["Rajabali Borzooei","Hossein Rashmanlou"],"meta":["April 2015Journal of Applied Mathematics & Informatics 33(5):545-557","DOI:10.14317/jami.2015.545","Project: Generalization of fuzzy graphs"],"references":["301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","280734496_Fuzzy_Colouring_of_Fuzzy_Graphs","280067009_Complete_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","280066549_Some_Properties_of_Highly_Irregular_Interval_Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","280066105_Balanced_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","292004369_Similar_relations_and_fuzzy_ordering","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","280066450_Some_Properties_of_Highly_Irregular_Interval_Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs"]}
