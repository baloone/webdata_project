{"id":"220812123_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Human_Thinking","abstract":"Research in AI has built upon the tools and techniques of many different disciplines, including formal logic, probability theory, decision theory, management science, linguistics and philosophy. However, the application of these disciplines in AI has necessitated the development of many enhancements and extensions. Among the most powerful of these are the methods of computational logic. I will argue that computational logic, embedded in an agent cycle, combines and improves upon both traditional logic and classical decision theory. I will also argue that many of its methods can be used, not only in AI, but also in ordinary life, to help people improve their own human intelligence without the assistance of computers.","authors":["Robert Kowalski"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.5591/978-1-57735-516-8/IJCAI11-013","SourceDBLP","Conference: IJCAI 2011, Proceedings of the 22nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, July 16-22, 2011"],"references":["277670064_Computational_Logic_and_Human_Thinking_-_How_to_be_Artificially_Intelligent","229071271_Representativeness_Revisited_Attribute_Substitution_in_Intuitive_Judgment","220432420_A_Proof_Procedure_Using_Connection_Graphs","215990956_Computational_Logic_and_Human_Thinking_How_to_be_Artificially_Intelligent","285132384_Value-Focused_Thinking_A_Path_to_Creative_Decision_Making","262173626_Logic_for_problem_solving","235625639_Logic_For_Problem_Solving","222304048_The_Independent_Choice_Logic_for_modelling_multiple_agents_under_uncertainty","222221648_Situated_agents_can_have_goals","37688067_Style_Toward_Clarity_and_Grace","23534676_A_Theoretical_Framework_for_Goal-Based_Choice_and_For_Prescriptive_Analysis"]}
