{"id":"353297743_A_Bricklayer-Tech_Report","abstract":"Technology is playing an increasingly prominent role in all human endeavors, including education. Tech enables the realization of educational environments that are adaptive, interactive, and immersive. Such environments are well-suited for appropriately engaging student populations comprised of digital natives. Bricklayer is an educational ecosystem whose focus is on the development of visuospatial, mathematical, and computational abilities foundational to computer science. This article gives an updated report on the core (Ed)Tech elements comprising the Bricklayer educational ecosystem.","authors":["Victor L.
