{"id":"325187441_Using_NCLab-karel_to_improve_computational_thinking_skill_of_junior_high_school_students","abstract":"Increasingly human interaction with technology and the increasingly complex development of digital technology world make the theme of computer science education interesting to study. Previous studies on Computer Literacy and Competency reveal that Indonesian teachers in general have fairly high computational skill, but their skill utilization are limited to some applications. This engenders limited and minimum computer-related learning for the students. On the other hand, computer science education is considered unrelated to real-world solutions. This paper attempts to address the utilization of NCLab- Karel in shaping the computational thinking in students. This computational thinking is believed to be able to making learn students about technology. Implementation of Karel utilization provides information that Karel is able to increase student interest in studying computational material, especially algorithm. Observations made during the learning process also indicate the growth and development of computing mindset in students.","authors":["Jajang Kusnendar","Harsa Wara"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 1013(1):012104","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1013/1/012104"],"references":["289991565_Digital_Literacy_Learning_System_for_Indonesian_Citizen","274309848_Computational_Thinking","265208083_How_to_Support_Students'_Computational_Thinking_Skills_in_Educational_Robotics_Activities","265120593_Computer_Literacy_and_Competency_A_Survey_of_Indonesian_Teachers_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language","261305816_Evaluating_the_Role_of_Collaboration_Scripts_as_Group_Guiding_Tools_in_Activities_of_Educational_Robotics_Conclusions_from_Three_Case_Studies","234810765_Computational_thinking_for_youth_in_practice","224930648_New_Approaches_and_Tools_in_Teaching_Programming","270695452_JKarelRobot","242231252_The_New_Educational_Imperative_Improving_High_School_Computer_Science_Education","228328531_Karel_the_Robot_A_Gentle_Introduction_to_the_Art_of_Programming"]}
