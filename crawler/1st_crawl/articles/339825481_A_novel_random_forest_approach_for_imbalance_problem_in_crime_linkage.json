{"id":"339825481_A_novel_random_forest_approach_for_imbalance_problem_in_crime_linkage","abstract":"Crime linkage is a challenging task in crime analysis, which is to find serial crimes committed by the same offenders. It can be regarded as a binary classification task detecting serial case pairs. However, most case pairs in the real world are nonserial, so there is a serious class imbalance in the crime linkage. In this paper, we propose a novel random forest based on the information granule. The approach doesnâ€™t resample the minority class or the majority class but concentrates on indistinguishable case pairs at the classification boundary. The information granule is used to identify case pairs that are difficult to distinguish in the dataset and constructs a nearly balanced dataset in the uncertainty region to deal with the imbalanced problem. In the proposed approach, random trees come from the original dataset and the above mentioned nearly balanced dataset. A real-world robbery dataset and some public imbalanced datasets are employed to measure the performance of the approach. The results show that the proposed approach is effective in dealing with class imbalances, and it can be extended to combine with other methods solving class imbalances.","authors":["Li Yusheng","Hong
