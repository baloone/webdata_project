{"id":"310021260_Cryptography_Technique_with_Modular_Multiplication_Block_Cipher_and_Playfair_Cipher","abstract":"There are many data security techniques like a cryptography, there are many algorithm like a MMB (Modular Multiplication Block Cipher) and Playfair Cipher. MMB operates using 128-bit plaintext, but it also uses 32-bit subblock MMB text (x0, x1, x2, x3) and 32-bit key subblock (k0, k1, k2, k3) and then the fundamental of this algorithm is determined by a multiplication modulo operation 2 32-1. Different from MMB, playfair cipher is a diagram substitution cipher which takes two letter from message and replace with two another pair letter, this paper combines playfair cipher as a key substitution and messages in plaintext to be encrypted with algorithms MMB, this combination is expected to increase the security level of messages.","authors":["Robbi Rahim","Ali Ikhwan"],"meta":["November 2016"],"references":["267198684_A_Novel_Block_Cipher_Involving_a_Key_Bunch_Matrix_and_a_Permutation","258652002_A_Novel_Block_Cipher_Involving_a_Key_Bunch_Matrix","220333624_Practical-time_Attack_on_the_Full_MMB_Block_Cipher","310830763_Cryptography_Playfair_Cipher_using_Linear_Feedback_Shift_Register","269838308_A_Modified_Version_of_Playfair_Cipher_Using_74_Matrix","221274563_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Full_MMB_Block_Cipher","46946663_Cryptography_An_Introduction_to_Computer_Security"]}
