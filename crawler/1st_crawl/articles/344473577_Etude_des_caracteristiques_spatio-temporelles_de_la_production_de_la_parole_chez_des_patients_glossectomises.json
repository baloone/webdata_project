{"id":"344473577_Etude_des_caracteristiques_spatio-temporelles_de_la_production_de_la_parole_chez_des_patients_glossectomises","abstract":"This study examines the spatio-temporal characteristics of production of VCV sequences uttered by glossectomised patients following endo-oral cancer. More specifically, it involves analysing different acoustic parameters such as: (V1, VOT, VTT, the acoustic silent phase, occlusion, V2). This investigation should allow us to report the consequences that glossectomy may have on the the timing of articulatory gestures (Sock, 1998). Ten patients were recorded in several pre- and post-surgical phases; it is thus a longitudinal study. The corpus analysed consists of eight VCV sequences. The objective is mainly to observe in the acoustic signal various acoustic events directly interpretable in articulatory terms, and thereby attempting to infer articulatory configurations from the timing between specific acoustic events. Statistical analyses showed significant changes in the duration of all variables measured during post-surgical recording phases. An improvement in the production of the sequences appears gradually over time and speech therapy, as can be seen for some patients whose productions resemble initial values recorded during the pre-surgical phase.","authors":["Hasna Zaouali","Vaxelaire BÃ©atrice","Christian Debry","Rudolph Sock"],"meta":["June 2020"],"references":["341755780_Etude_acoustique_de_la_production_de_la_parole_chez_des_patients_glossectomises","337698153_Reorganisation_du_conduit_vocal_et_reorganisation_corticale_de_la_parole_de_la_perturbation_aux_levres_a_la_glossectomie_Etudes_acoustiques_et_IRMf","325638553_An_acoustic_study_of_plosive_consonants_produced_by_patients_with_and_without_reconstruction_after_partial_or_total_glossectomy_Focusing_on_VOT","248349308_Voice_onset_and_voice_termination_features_of_stutterers","21948754_Voice_Onset_Time_Frication_and_Aspiration_in_Word-Initial_Consonant_Clusters"]}
