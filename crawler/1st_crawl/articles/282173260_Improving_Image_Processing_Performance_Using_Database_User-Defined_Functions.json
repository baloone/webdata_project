{"id":"282173260_Improving_Image_Processing_Performance_Using_Database_User-Defined_Functions","abstract":"Writing user-defined functions or stored procedures presents common way in application development using a relational database management system. It allows to embed application code inside of RDBMS. In this paper, we examine an effect of embedding selected computer vision algorithms as user-defined functions in a relational database management system. We show that such a combination can in certain scenarios lead to a performance improvement.","authors":["Michal Vagac","M.
