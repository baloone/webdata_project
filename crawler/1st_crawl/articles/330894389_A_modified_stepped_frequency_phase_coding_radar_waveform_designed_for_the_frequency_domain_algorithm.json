{"id":"330894389_A_modified_stepped_frequency_phase_coding_radar_waveform_designed_for_the_frequency_domain_algorithm","abstract":"A great deal of interest has been paid to enhance the radar range resolution for the last decades. One of the techniques is to construct a waveform combining inter-pulse and intra-pulse modulations. In this paper, stepped frequency (SF) waveform is used to represent the former, whereas phase coding (PC) is considered for the latter. To obtain the high-resolution range profile (HRRP) of a target induced by an SF waveform at the receiver, one of the approaches is the frequency domain (FD) algorithm. It has been successfully applied with SF linear frequency modulation waveforms. However, based on our investigations, processing the SFPC waveform with the FD algorithm does not lead to the performance, in terms of peak sidelobe ratio (PSLR) and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), of the single-carrier phase coding (SCPC) waveform processed with a matched filter (MF). To overcome these drawbacks, we propose to split the spectrum of a phase coded pulse into a predetermined number of portions, and then to successively transmit the time-domain transformed versions of these various portions. The received echoes are then processed with a modified version of the FD algorithm. Our analysis and simulations show that the proposed waveform can be characterized by a PSLR and an ISLR close to those of the SCPC processed with MF in some scenarios.","authors":["Mahdi Saleh","Samir-Mohamad Omar","Eric Grivel","Oussama Bazzi"],"meta":["February 2019Digital Signal Processing 88(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.dsp.2019.01.020"],"references":["316727263_Phase_Coded_Stepped_Frequency_Linear_Frequency_Modulated_Waveform_Synthesis_Technique_for_Low_Altitude_Ultra_Wideband_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar","315058405_Chirp_Signals_and_Noisy_Waveforms_for_Solid-State_Surveillance_Radars","279969035_Design_of_OFDM_radar_pulses_using_genetic_algorithm_based_techniques","265007522_Application_of_super-sva_to_stepped-chirp_radar_imaging_with_frequency_band_gaps_between_subchirps","224346841_Grating_Lobes_Suppression_in_Stepped-Frequency_Pulse_Train","3782828_Stepped-frequency_processing_by_reconstruction_of_target_reflectivity_spectrum","313689296_High-resolution_Imaging_and_Three-dimensional_Reconstruction_of_Precession_Targets_by_Exploiting_Sparse_Apertures","313288271_Imaging_approach_for_airborne_stepped-frequency_synthetic_aperture_radar_in_the_squinted_mode","311448657_Dynamic_ISAR_Imaging_of_Maneuvering_Targets_Based_on_Sparse_Matrix_Recovery","305380116_A_Novel_Barker_Code_Algorithm_For_Resolving_Range_Ambiguity_In_High_PRF_Radars","278656542_Study_on_ISAR_Imaging_of_Stepped-Frequency_Chirp_Signal","269401353_Novel_radar_signal_models_using_nonlinear_frequency_modulation","265856043_RFI_Suppression_Based_on_Phase-Coded_Stepped-Frequency_Waveform_in_Through-Wall_Radar","224374778_Matched_NLFM_pulse_compression_method_with_ultra-low_sidelobes","220052700_Micro-Doppler_Effect_Analysis_and_Feature_Extraction_in_ISAR_Imaging_With_Stepped-Frequency_Chirp_Signals","44262333_A_Study_on_Stepped_Frequency_Radar_by_Using_Intra-Pulse_Phase_Coded_Modulation","3700721_High_resolution_SAR_processing_using_stepped-frequencies","3005736_Optimum_Mismatched_Filters_for_Sidelobe_Suppression"]}
