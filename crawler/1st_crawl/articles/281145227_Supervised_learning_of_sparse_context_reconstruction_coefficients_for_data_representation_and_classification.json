{"id":"281145227_Supervised_learning_of_sparse_context_reconstruction_coefficients_for_data_representation_and_classification","abstract":"Context of data points, which is usually defined as the other data points in\na data set, has been found to play important roles in data representation and\nclassification. In this paper, we study the problem of using context of a data\npoint for its classification problem. Our work is inspired by the observation\nthat actually only very few data points are critical in the context of a data\npoint for its representation and classification. We propose to represent a data\npoint as the sparse linear combination of its context, and learn the sparse\ncontext in a supervised way to increase its discriminative ability. To this\nend, we proposed a novel formulation for context learning, by modeling the\nlearning of context parameter and classifier in a unified objective, and\noptimizing it with an alternative strategy in an iterative algorithm.\nExperiments on three benchmark data set show its advantage over\nstate-of-the-art context-based data representation and classification methods.","authors":["Xuejie
