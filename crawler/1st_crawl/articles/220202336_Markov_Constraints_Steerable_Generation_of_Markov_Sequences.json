{"id":"220202336_Markov_Constraints_Steerable_Generation_of_Markov_Sequences","abstract":"Markov chains are a well known tool to model temporal properties of many phenomena, from text structure to fluctuations in\neconomics. Because they are easy to generate, Markovian sequences, i.e. temporal sequences having the Markov property, are\nalso used for content generation applications such as text or music generation that imitate a given style. However, Markov\nsequences are traditionally generated using greedy, left-to-right algorithms. While this approach is computationally cheap,\nit is fundamentally unsuited for interactive control. This paper addresses the issue of generating steerable Markovian sequences. We target interactive applications such as games, in which users want to control, through simple input devices, the way\nthe system generates a Markovian sequence, such as a text, a musical sequence or a drawing. To this aim, we propose to revisit\nMarkov sequence generation as a branch and bound constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). We propose a CSP formulation of the\nbasic Markovian hypothesis as elementary Markov Constraints (EMC). We propose algorithms that achieve domain-consistency for\nthe propagators of EMCs, in an event-based implementation of CSP. We show how EMCs can be combined to estimate the global\nMarkovian probability of a whole sequence, and accommodate for different species of Markov generation such as fixed order,\nvariable-order, or smoothing. Such a formulation, although more costly than traditional greedy generation algorithms, yields\nthe immense advantage of being naturally steerable, since control specifications can be represented by arbitrary additional\nconstraints, without any modification of the generation algorithm. We illustrate our approach on simple yet combinatorial\nchord sequence and melody generation problems and give some performance results.","authors":["Francois Pachet","Pierre Roy"],"meta":["April 2011Constraints 16(2):148-172","DOI:10.1007/s10601-010-9101-4","SourceDBLP","Project: Flow Composer"],"references":["304126768_A_combinatorial_approach_to_content-based_music_selection","270451739_Filtering_algorithm_for_constraints_of_difference_in_CSPs","261686495_The_Continuator_Musical_Interaction_With_Style","246349662_Guessing_the_Composer's_Mind_Applying_Universal_Prediction_to_Musical_Style","313721982_A_filtering_algorithm_for_constraints_of_difference_in_CSPs","313672340_Learning_probabilistic_automata_with_variable_memory_length","277298914_The_Power_of_Amnesia_Learning_Probabilistic_Automata_with_Variable_Memory_Length","263963883_Algorithmic_Composition_Paradigms_of_Automated_Music_Generation","263762999_Improved_Methods_for_Statistical_Modelling_of_Monophonic_Music","251470841_Chapter_4_Constraint_Programming"]}
