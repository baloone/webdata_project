{"id":"325207704_Discussion_on_instabilities_in_breaking_waves_Vortices_air-entrainment_and_droplet_generation","abstract":"When waves are breaking, several instabilities are observed to be responsible for several features, like vortices, air-entrainment and droplets generation. Being able to ascertain if the number and sizes of droplets during breaking events can be controlled by instabilities and in which order these perturbations lead to droplets production, is evidently of great interest. Thanks to some numerical simulations and new experimental visualizations, a discussion is proposed to analyze the successive steps of atomization of a plunging liquid jet when a wave break. The complexity of the phenomenon will be highlighted, while some possible instability mechanisms will be described. Following the plunging jet impact, vortex filaments are produced, inducing air entrainment and complex structures which can be similar to the so-called obliquely descending eddies.","authors":["Pierre Lubin","Olivier Kimmoun","Fabrice Veron","St√©phane Glockner"],"meta":["May 2018European Journal of Mechanics - B/Fluids 73","DOI:10.1016/j.euromechflu.2018.05.006"],"references":["295254932_Structure_of_the_Airflow_above_Surface_Waves","282854721_Transverse_instabilities_of_ascending_planar_jets_formed_by_wave_impacts_on_vertical_walls","280900070_A_fourth-order_accurate_curvature_computation_in_a_level_set_framework_for_two-phase_flows_subjected_to_surface_tension_forces","278633053_Large_Eddy_Simulation_of_plunging_breaking_waves","272196896_Experimental_study_on_plunging_breaking_waves_in_deep_water","266619197_Three-Dimensional_Simulations_of_Deep-Water_Breaking_Waves","265789829_A_numerical_investigation_of_wave-breaking-induced_turbulent_coherent_structure_under_a_solitary_wave","263857126_Three-dimensional_reversed_horseshoe_vortex_structures_under_broken_solitary_waves","249993701_Investigation_of_the_physical_scaling_of_sea_spray_spume_droplet_production","249970655_Time-Dependent_Multi-material_Flow_with_Large_Fluid_Distortion","249614884_Spume_Drops_Produced_by_the_Wind_Tearing_of_Wave_Crests","234151181_Fragmentation","234146181_Air-Entrainment_Mechanisms_in_Plunging_Jets_and_Breaking_Waves","231964814_On_spray_formation","231932752_Inertial_scaling_of_dissipation_in_unsteady_breaking_waves","226099675_The_spray_contribution_to_net_evaporation_from_the_sea_A_review_of_recent_progress","313242458_Fundamentals_of_the_hydrodynamic_mechanism_of_splitting_in_dispersion_processes","312051499_Measurements_of_suspended_sediment_transport_and_turbulent_coherent_structures_induced_by_breaking_waves_using_two-phase_volumetric_three-component_velocimetry","311092929_Large-eddy_simulation_of_wave-breaking_induced_turbulent_coherent_structures_and_suspended_sediment_transport_on_a_barred_beach","305735339_Wrapping_up_a_century_of_splashes","305451768_Air_entrainment_and_bubble_statistics_in_breaking_waves","305381585_Experimental_Study_of_Wave_Impacts_on_a_Corrugated_Ceiling","303806828_Review_of_mass_and_momentum_interactions_during_drop_impact_on_a_liquid_film","297589307_High-fidelity_simulations_of_bubble_droplet_and_spray_formation_in_breaking_waves","285076905_The_Fluid_Mechanics_of_Waves_Approaching_Breaking","276433163_On_the_combined_effects_of_surface_tension_force_calculation_and_interface_advection_on_spurious_currents_within_Volume_of_Fluid_and_Level_Set_frameworks","273487072_Numerical_simulations_of_three-dimensional_plunging_breaking_waves_Generation_and_evolution_of_aerated_vortex_filaments","273187395_Ocean_Spray","272161875_Direct_numerical_simulation_of_free-surface_and_interfacial_flow","269157689_AN_EXPERIMENTAL_STUDY_OF_SURFACE_INSTABILITIES_DURING_WAVE_BREAKING","260550660_Numerical_simulation_of_breaking_waves","259133713_Numerical_simulations_of_air_entrainment_in_a_plunging_jet_of_liquid","258647145_Sea_spray_spume_droplet_production_in_high_wind_speeds","256198072_The_Deformation_of_Steep_Surface_Waves_on_Water_I_A_Numerical_Method_of_Computation","255656021_Air_Entrainment_Processes_and_Bubble_Size_Distributions_in_the_Surf_Zone","252329652_Large_Eddy_Simulation_for_Incompressible_Flows_An_Introduction","251587609_Void_fraction_measurements_and_scale_effects_in_breaking_waves_in_freshwater_and_seawater","251434506_Void_fraction_measurements_beneath_plunging_and_spilling_breaking_waves","249615308_A_Sea_State-Dependent_Spume_Generation_Function","249614530_On_the_Disintegration_of_the_Jet_in_a_Plunging_Breaker","238185553_Gurtler_Vortices","235084160_Late_Stage_of_Rayleigh-Taylor_Instability","234150901_Breaking_Waves_on_Beaches","232834376_Longitudinal_Streakings_In_Liquid_Currents","232013048_Parametric_solutions_for_breaking_waves","231958583_Numerical_study_of_the_effects_of_the_breaking_intensity_on_wave_breaking_flows","231887121_Structure_of_the_turbulent_flow_field_under_breaking_waves_in_the_surf_zone","230605818_Numerical_study_of_the_hydrodynamics_of_regular_waves_breaking_on_a_sloping_beach","229340217_Scarifying_and_fingering_surfaces_of_plunging_jets","226855316_Critical_speeds_and_sizes_of_liquid_globules"]}
