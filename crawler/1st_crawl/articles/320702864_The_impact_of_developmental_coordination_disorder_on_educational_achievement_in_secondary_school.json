{"id":"320702864_The_impact_of_developmental_coordination_disorder_on_educational_achievement_in_secondary_school","abstract":"Background: \nDevelopmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a common developmental disorder but its long term impact on health and education are poorly understood.\n\nAim: \nTo assess the impact of DCD diagnosed at 7 years, and co-occurring developmental difficulties, on educational achievement at 16 years.\n\nMethods: \nA prospective cohort study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). National General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exam results and Special Educational Needs provision were compared for adolescents with DCD (n=284) and controls (n=5425).\n\nResults: \nAdolescents with DCD achieved a median of 2 GCSEs whilst controls achieved a median of 7 GCSEs. Compared to controls, adolescents with DCD were much less likely to achieve 5 or more GCSEs in secondary school (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.21-0.34), even after adjustment for gender, socio-economic status and IQ (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.44-0.81). Those with DCD were more likely to have persistent difficulties with reading, social communication and hyperactivity/inattention, which all affected educational achievement. Nearly 40% of adolescents with DCD were not in receipt of additional formal support during school.\n\nConclusions: \nDCD has a significant impact on educational achievement and therefore life chances. Co-occurring problems with reading skills, social communication difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention are common and contribute to educational difficulties. Greater understanding of DCD among educational and medical professionals and policy makers is crucial to improve the support provided for these individuals.","authors":["Ian Harrowell","Linda I Holl√©n","Raghu Lingam","Alan Emond"],"meta":["October 2017Research in Developmental Disabilities 72:13-22","DOI:10.1016/j.ridd.2017.10.014","Project: Psychosocial Impact of Developmental Coordination Disorder in Late Adolescence"],"references":["317006034_Mental_health_outcomes_of_developmental_coordination_disorder_in_late_adolescence","305786779_A_systematic_review_of_high_quality_randomized_controlled_trials_investigating_motor_skill_programmes_for_children_with_developmental_coordination_disorder","301716569_Overlapping_Phenotypes_in_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_and_Developmental_Coordination_Disorder_A_Cross-Syndrome_Comparison_of_Motor_and_Social_Skills","279888159_Clumsiness_in_Adolescence_Educational_Motor_and_Social_Outcomes_of_Motor_Delay_Detected_at_5_Years","265970306_Adaptation_and_Extension_of_the_European_Recommendations_EACD_on_Developmental_Coordination_Disorder_DCD_for_the_UK_context","284496656_Leeds_Consensus_statement_Developmental_Coordination_Disorder_as_a_specific_learning_difficulty","281194742_Does_the_Animal_Fun_program_improve_social-emotional_and_behavioural_outcomes_in_children_aged_4-6_years","280050405_Peer_problems_mediate_the_relationship_between_developmental_coordination_disorder_and_behavioral_problems_in_school-aged_children","279863059_Surveying_parental_experiences_of_receiving_a_diagnosis_of_developmental_coordination_disorder_DCD","264484291_Peer_victimization_and_depression_in_children_with_and_without_motor_coordination_difficulties","256984860_Sleep_patterns_in_children_with_autistic_spectrum_disorders_A_prospective_cohort_study","235649325_Self-reported_mood_general_health_wellbeing_and_employment_status_in_adults_with_suspected_DCD","260269944_Intellectual_development_from_early_childhood_to_early_adulthood_The_impact_of_early_IQ_differences_on_stability_and_change_over_time","252324542_Is_severity_of_motor_coordination_difficulties_related_to_co-morbidity_in_children_at_risk_for_developmental_coordination_disorder","236249466_Social_participation_by_children_with_developmental_coordination_disorder_compared_to_their_peers"]}
