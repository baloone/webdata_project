{"id":"327819026_Barriers_to_Food_Literacy_A_Conceptual_Model_to_Explore_Factors_Inhibiting_Proficiency","abstract":"Food literacy research typically conceptualizes food-related knowledge and skills as contributing to improved health and nutrition; however, there is limited research examining the process that leads to this improvement. This article reviews the literature reporting barriers to food literacy proficiency in order to examine the relationship between food-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Informed by these barrier types, its central objective is to develop a model of food literacy proficiency that highlights the relationship between nutrition education and health-related outcomes. This model will help researchers, educators, and nutrition professionals implement effective interventions with enhanced capacity to change food-related behaviors.","authors":["Emily Truman","Charlene Elliott"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1016/j.jneb.2018.08.008"],"references":["299616609_Challenges_to_acquiring_and_utilizing_food_literacy_Perceptions_of_young_Canadian_adults","284295065_Food_or_nutrition_literacy_What_concept_should_guide_home_economics_education","263187277_Local_public_food_strategies_as_a_social_innovation_Early_insights_from_the_LOMA-Nymarkskolen_case_study","262534303_The_relationship_between_food_literacy_and_dietary_intake_in_adolescents_A_systematic_review","232199900_Food_Literacy_Partners_Program_A_Strategy_To_Increase_Community_Food_Literacy","228465847_From_Nutrients_to_Nurturance_A_Conceptual_Introduction_to_Food_Well-Being","51801249_Cook_It_Up_A_community-based_cooking_program_for_at-risk_youth_Overview_of_a_food_literacy_intervention","12766080_Why_Don't_Physicians_Follow_Clinical_Practice_Guidelines","317959485_Identifying_attributes_of_food_literacy_a_scoping_review","316785125_Defining_food_literacy_A_scoping_review","315342160_Effectiveness_of_Australian_cooking_skill_interventions","313361981_Food_and_nutrition_education_in_private_Indian_secondary_schools","309302893_What_is_the_status_of_food_literacy_in_Australian_high_schools_Perceptions_of_home_economics_teachers","305629099_Environmental_factors_of_food_literacy_in_Australian_high_schools_views_of_home_economics_teachers_Environmental_factors_of_food_literacy","285361243_Domestic_Cooking_and_Food_Skills_A_Review","282432730_Caroline_Elementary_School's_hybrid_garden_a_case_study_in_social_marketing","282228430_A_Pilot_Study_The_Use_of_a_Survey_to_Assess_the_Food_Knowledge_of_Nutrition_Students_at_Various_Levels_of_Nutrition_Education","277939811_Food_Literacy_Definition_and_Framework_for_Action","277477486_The_Nuances_of_Health_Literacy_Nutrition_Literacy_and_Food_Literacy","270597975_Hong_Kong_parents'_perceptions_of_the_transference_of_food_preparation_skills","259917002_Defining_food_literacy_and_its_components","259549769_Is_cooking_dead_The_state_of_Home_Economics_Food_and_Nutrition_education_in_a_Canadian_province","248440201_Why_don''t_physicians_fol-_low_clinical_practice_guidelines","239839543_An_Apple_A_Day_Exploring_Food_and_Agricultural_Knowledge_and_Skill_Among_Children_in_Southern_Ontario","235756050_Using_Photovoice_with_At-risk_Youth_In_a_Community-based_Cooking_Program","230621856_Building_Food_Literacy_and_Positive_Relationships_with_Healthy_Food_in_Children_through_School_Gardens","230485326_Insight_from_the_Public_on_Home_Economics_and_Formal_Food_Literacy"]}
