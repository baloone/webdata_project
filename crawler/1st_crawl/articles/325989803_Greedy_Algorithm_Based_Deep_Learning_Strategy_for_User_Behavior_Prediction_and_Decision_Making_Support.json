{"id":"325989803_Greedy_Algorithm_Based_Deep_Learning_Strategy_for_User_Behavior_Prediction_and_Decision_Making_Support","abstract":"In this paper, we suggest a deep learning strategy for decision support, based on a greedy algorithm. Decision making support by artificial intelligence is of the most challenging trends in modern computer science. Currently various strategies exist and are increasingly improved in order to meet practical needs of user-oriented platforms like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.","authors":["Kumar Ap"],"meta":["January 2018Journal of Computer and Communications 06(06):45-53","DOI:10.4236/jcc.2018.66004"],"references":["321600307_Intelligent_Decision_Making_An_AI-Based_Approach","307636671_A_Deep_Multi-Level_Network_for_Saliency_Prediction","303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","295396461_Detecting_figures_and_part_labels_in_patents_competition-based_development_of_graphics_recognition_algorithms","288774104_Discovering_Consumers'_Purchase_Intentions_Based_on_Mobile_Search_Behaviors","284219029_Predicting_online_user_behaviour_using_deep_learning_algorithms","283986729_Going_Deeper_in_Facial_Expression_Recognition_using_Deep_Neural_Networks","328610636_Contemporary_Artificial_Intelligence","316064830_Handbook_of_Neural_Network_Signal_Processing","303563902_Going_deeper_in_facial_expression_recognition_using_deep_neural_networks"]}
