{"id":"313161725_Why_the_Dichotomy_'L1_Versus_LX_User'_is_Better_than_'Native_Versus_Non-native_Speaker'","abstract":"The traditional dichotomy, ‘native’ versus ‘non-native speaker’ has to be rejected because of the inherent ideological assumptions about the superiority of the former and the inferiority of the latter. Cook’s (2002) substitution of ‘non-native speaker’ by ‘L2 user’ represented a big step forward in creating a more balanced dichotomy, but it kept the first part, namely the term ‘native speaker’—though not necessarily a monolingual one. The present contribution argues that the final step should be the substitution of ‘native speaker’ by ‘L1 user’. The dichotomy ‘L1 user’ versus ‘LX user’ – referring to any foreign language acquired after the age at which the first language(s) was acquired, that is after the age of 3 years, to any level of proficiency- is value-neutral. They are equal and can be complementary. It also suggests that variation can exist within both L1(s) and LX(s) and that all individuals can be multicompetent users of multiple languages.","authors":["Jean-Marc Dewaele"],"meta":["January 2017Applied Linguistics 39(2)","DOI:10.1093/applin/amw055","Project: General SLA and multilingualism issues"],"references":["313408017_Glimpses_of_semantic_restructuring_of_English_emotion-laden_words_of_American_English_L1_users_residing_outside_the_USA","295853816_Thirty_shades_of_offensiveness_L1_and_LX_English_users'_understanding_perception_and_self-reported_use_of_negative_emotion-laden_words","286952578_From_native_speakers_to_new_speakers-_Problematizing_nativeness_in_language_revitalization_contexts","286922855_Multi-competence_and_emotion","330660899_TheNative_Speaker_Myth_and_Reality","325675879_Research_questions_and_methodology_of_multi-competence","299546996_The_non-native_English_speaker_teachers_in_TESOL_movement","291836037_Emotions_in_Multiple_Languages","286709821_Language_attrition","260304346_Going_Beyond_the_Native_Speaker_in_Language_Teaching","233722464_Affective_processing_in_bilingual_speakers_Disembodied_cognition","232004616_The_robustness_of_aptitude_effects_in_near-native_second_language_acquisition","245948243_Displacing_the''native_speaker''_Expertise_affiliation_and_inheritance"]}
