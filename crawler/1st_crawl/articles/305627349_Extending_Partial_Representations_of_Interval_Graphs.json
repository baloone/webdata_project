{"id":"305627349_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Interval_Graphs","abstract":"Interval graphs are intersection graphs of closed intervals of the real-line. The well-known computational problem, called recognition, asks whether an input graph G can be represented by closed intervals, i.e., whether G is an interval graph. There are several linear-time algorithms known for recognizing interval graphs, the oldest one is by Booth and Lueker (J Comput Syst Sci 13:335–379, 1976) based on PQ-trees. In this paper, we study a generalization of recognition, called partial representation extension. The input of this problem consists of a graph G with a partial representation \\({{{\\mathcal {R}}}}'\\) fixing the positions of some intervals. The problem asks whether it is possible to place the remaining interval and create an interval representation \\({{{\\mathcal {R}}}}\\) of the entire graph G extending \\({{{\\mathcal {R}}}}'\\). We generalize the characterization of interval graphs by Fulkerson and Gross (Pac J Math 15:835–855, 1965) to extendible partial representations. Using it, we give a linear-time algorithm for partial representation extension based on a reordering problem of PQ-trees.","authors":["Pavel Klavík","Jan Kratochvíl","Yota Otachi","Toshiki Saitoh"],"meta":["July 2016Algorithmica 78(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-016-0186-z","Project: Partial Representation Extension Problems"],"references":["285648769_The_Partial_Visibility_Representation_Extension_Problem","282906519_On_the_Classes_of_Interval_Graphs_of_Limited_Nesting_and_Count_of_Lengths","265069503_Lex-BFS_a_Partition_Reening_Technique_Application_to_Transitive_Orientation_Interval_Graph_Recognition_and_Consecutive_1's_Testing","263390347_Minimal_Obstructions_for_Partial_Representations_of_Interval_Graphs","256477000_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Circle_Graphs","256441540_Bounded_Representations_of_Interval_and_Proper_Interval_Graphs","230595632_An_Incremental_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Recognizing_Interval_Graphs","224871696_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Function_Graphs_and_Permutation_Graphs","220908183_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Interval_Graphs","220533360_Realizing_Interval_Graphs_with_Size_and_Distance_Constraints","49457109_Testing_Planarity_of_Partially_Embedded_Graphs","46585811_Simultaneous_Interval_Graphs","30508892_On_Extending_a_Partial_Straight-Line_Drawing","318495045_The_simultaneous_representation_problem_for_chordal_comparability_and_permutation_graphs","317356768_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Unit_Circular-arc_Graphs","311508101_The_Partial_Visibility_Representation_Extension_Problem","305476913_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Proper_and_Unit_Interval_Graphs","295261668_Contact_Representations_of_Planar_Graphs_Extending_a_Partial_Representation_is_Hard","290476294_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_Finding_Tucker_Submatrices_and_Lekkerkerker--Boland_Subgraphs","288245735_Sur_Deux_Proprietes_des_Classes_d'Ensembles","285501422_Discrete_Mathematical_Models","281576832_Completing_orientations_of_partially_oriented_graphs","280765566_Lex-BFS_and_partition_refinement_with_applications_to_transitive_orientation_interval_graph_recognition_and_consecutive_ones_testing","265589007_Interval_Graph_Representation_with_Given_Interval_and_Intersection_Lengths","265461639_Indifference_graphs","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","264826416_Minimal_and_short_representations_of_unit_interval_and_unit_circular-arc_graphs","259528500_On_Finding_Tucker_Submatrices_and_Lekkerkerker-Boland_Subgraphs","248190854_Uber_eine_Art_von_Graphen","245992693_Efficient_Graph_Representations","245480274_Scheduling_of_traffic_lights-A_new_approach","243768419_Topics_in_Intersection_Graph_Theory","239059987_Interval_Orders_and_Interval_Graphs_-_A_Study_of_Partially_Ordered_Sets","230596032_Representation_of_a_Finite_Graph_by_a_Set_of_Intervals_on_the_Real_Line","228610594_New_perspectives_on_interval_orders_and_interval_graphs","226975828_Linear-Time_Recognition_of_Circular-Arc_Graphs","222829615_Lex-BFS_and_partition_refinement","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms","220617665_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Vertex_Elimination_on_Graphs","220616392_OMN_Algorithms_for_the_Recognition_and_Isomorphism_Problems_on_Circular-Arc_Graphs","220532672_The_LBFS_Structure_and_Recognition_of_Interval_Graphs","38346920_Incidence_Matrices_and_Interval_Graphs","31775013_Discrete_Mathematical_Models_with_Applications_to_Social_Biological_and_Environmental_Problems_FS_Roberts","7188698_On_the_Topology_of_the_Genetic_Fine_Structure"]}
