{"id":"265371788_Double_rotations","abstract":"We consider a map called a double rotation, which is composed of two rotations on a circle. Specifically, a double rotation is a map on the interval [0,1) that maps x∈[0,c) to {x+α}, and x∈[c,1) to {x+β}. Although double rotations are discontinuous and noninvertible in general, we show that almost every double rotation can be reduced to a simple rotation, and the set of the parameter values such that the double rotation is irreducible to a rotation has a fractal structure. We also examine a characteristic number of a double rotation, which is called a discharge number. The graph of the discharge number as a function of c reflects the fractal structure, and is very complicated.","authors":["Hideyuki Suzuki","Shunji Ito","Kazuyuki Aihara"],"meta":["July 2005Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems 13(2)","DOI:10.3934/dcds.2005.13.515","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["228531833_Dynamics_of_a_piecewise_rotation","259402421_Interval_translation_mappings","254208256_Dynamics_of_Caianiello's_equation","37448696_Dielectric_breakdown_of_solids","2564743_Piecewise_monotone_maps_without_periodic_points_Rigidity_measures_and_complexity","2104679_The_Gauss_map_on_a_class_of_interval_translation_mappings"]}
