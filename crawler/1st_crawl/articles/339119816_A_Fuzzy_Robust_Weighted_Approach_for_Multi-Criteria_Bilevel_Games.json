{"id":"339119816_A_Fuzzy_Robust_Weighted_Approach_for_Multi-Criteria_Bilevel_Games","abstract":"This work proposes a fuzzy-robust weighted method (FRWM) for a bilevel game model comprising both multiple leaders and followers (named as multicriteria bilevel game). In this game, each decision-maker has several competing objectives and plays a noncooperative multicriteria Nash game with others at his level. Each decision-maker is assumed to be uncertain about the exact weights over his objectives, but these weights belong to a given set. Further, each player proposes a fuzzy robust weighted method to address the uncertainty, i.e., each player will minimize his maximum weighted sum objective in which the maximization is as regard to the given weight set. Then a new equilibrium concept named as fuzzy-robust weighted Nash equilibrium (FRWNE) is presented. It can be proven that there is at least one this equilibrium even though the weights are infinite. When the weight set of multicriteria bilevel game is polyhedral, we can obtain a fuzzy robust-weighted Nash equilibrium by solving a group of mathematical programming problems with equilibrium constraints. We illustrate the usefulness and efficiency of our fuzzy-robust weighted approach to a supply chain multicriteria bilevel competition problem.","authors":["Ying Ji","Shaojian Qu","Zhong Wu","Zhimin Liu"],"meta":["February 2020IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TII.2020.2969456"],"references":["325163339_Aircraft_robust_multidisciplinary_design_optimization_methodology_based_on_fuzzy_preference_function","323328576_Weight_Optimization_of_Valve_for_Cost_Effectiveness_Using_Value_Analysis","313333961_Effect_of_self-weight_on_topological_optimization_of_static_loading_structures","305772685_Robust_Multiobjective_Optimisation_for_Fuzzy_Job_Shop_Problems","292153477_The_Worst-Case_Weighted_Multi-Objective_Game_with_an_Application_to_Supply_Chain_Competitions","266295779_Robust_Multi-objective_Optimization_Based_on_a_User_Perspective","228684804_Robust_Convex_Optimization","228461369_Multiobjective_Games_and_Determining_Pareto-Nash_Equilibria","228348052_Robust_optimization_made_easy_with_ROME","224387475_Robust_Multi-Objective_TEAM_22_Problem_A_Case_Study_of_Uncertainties_in_Design_Optimization","6687491_Introducing_Robustness_in_Multi-Objective_Optimization","332010373_Optimal_strategy_for_a_green_supply_chain_considering_shipping_policy_and_default_risk","330533236_A_bilevel_programming_model_for_operative_decisions_on_special_trains_An_Indian_Railways_perspective","325786267_Robust_Optimization_for_Non-Linear_Impact_of_Data_Variation","324868618_Coordinated_optimization_of_low-carbon_product_family_and_its_manufacturing_process_design_by_a_bilevel_game-theoretic_model","320382732_The_Noncooperative_Transportation_Problem_and_Linear_Generalized_Nash_Games","315242968_Robust_Empirical_Optimization_is_Almost_the_Same_As_Mean-Variance_Optimization","309180864_Pareto_Optimality_and_Existence_of_Quasi-Equilibrium_in_Exchange_Economies_with_an_Indefinite_Future","306076581_Approximated_set-valued_mapping_approach_for_handling_multiobjective_bilevel_problems","304536459_Multiobjective_differential_evolution_algorithm_based_on_decomposition_for_a_type_of_multiobjective_bilevel_programming_problems","282896038_A_New_Method_for_Elicitation_of_Criteria_Weights_in_Additive_Models_Flexible_and_Interactive_Tradeoff","273480919_Equilibrium_existence_for_multi-leader-follower_generalized_constrained_multiobjective_games_in_locally_FC-uniform_spaces","265824630_Existence_Uniqueness_and_Computation_of_Robust_Nash_Equilibria_in_a_Class_of_Multi-Leader-Follower_Games","229990620_Equilibrium_points_in_games_with_vector_payoffs","228707254_Interval_Robust_Multi-objective_Algorithm","222301276_Complementarity_Problems_in_GAMS_and_the_Path_Solver","38347914_An_Analog_of_the_Minmax_Theorem_for_Vector_Payoffs"]}
