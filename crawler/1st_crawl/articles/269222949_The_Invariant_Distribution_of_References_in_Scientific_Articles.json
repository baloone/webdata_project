{"id":"269222949_The_Invariant_Distribution_of_References_in_Scientific_Articles","abstract":"The organization of scientific papers typically follows a standardized pattern, the well-known IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). Using the full text of 45,000 papers published in the PLoS series of journals as a case study, this paper investi- gates, from the viewpoint of bibliometrics, how refer- ences are distributed along the structure of scientific papers, as well as the age of these cited references. It shows that, once the sections of articles are realigned to follow the IMRaD sequence, the position of cited refer- ences along the text of articles is invariant across all PLoS journals, with the introduction and conclusion accounting for most of the references. It also provides evidence that the age of cited references varies quite a lot by section, with older references being found in the methods and more recent ones in the discussion. On the whole, these results provide insight into the different roles citations have in the scholarly communication process.","authors":["Marc Bertin","Iana Atanassova","Vincent Lariviere","Yves Gingras"],"meta":["June 2015Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 67(1)","DOI:10.1002/asi.23367","Project: Mining Scientific Papers: Citations, Structure, Semantics"],"references":["261557876_A_Study_of_Lexical_Distribution_in_Citation_Contexts_through_the_IMRaD_Standard","249652069_The_Distribution_of_References_in_Scientific_Papers_an_Analysis_of_the_IMRaD_Structure","236597285_Relevance_distributions_across_Bradford_Zones_Can_Bradfordizing_improve_search","229596548_Semantic_Enrichment_of_Scientific_Publications_and_Metadata_Citation_Analysis_Through_Contextual_and_Cognitive_Analysis","221397635_Developing_a_Test_Collection_for_the_Evaluation_of_Integrated_Search","220364738_Interpreting_maps_of_science_using_citation_context_sentiments_A_preliminary_investigation","51509928_The_introduction_methods_results_and_discussion_IMRAD_structure_A_Survey_of_its_use_in_different_authoring_partnerships_in_a_students'_journal","7878707_Adoption_of_structured_abstracts_by_general_medical_journals_and_format_for_a_structured_abstract","7171126_The_Uniform_Requirements_for_Manuscripts_Submitted_to_Biomedical_Journals_Recommended_by_the_International_Committee_of_Medical_Journal_Editors","2227182_Reducing_semantic_complexity_in_distributed_Digital_Libraries_treatment_of_term_vagueness_and_document_re-ranking","325673071_Citation_context_versus_the_frequency_counts_of_citation_histories","261476659_Are_all_literature_citations_equally_important_Automatic_citation_strength_estimation_and_its_applications","257692378_The_distribution_of_references_across_texts_Some_implications_for_citation_analysis","256076230_Where_are_Citations_Located_in_the_Body_of_Scientific_Articles_A_Study_of_the_Distributions_of_Citation_Locations","249738002_The_Making_of_Meaning","244442722_Some_Results_on_the_Function_and_Quality_of_Citation","242925754_The_scientific_paper_as_an_archaeological_artefact","242925498_Agreement_and_divergence_on_referencing_practice","242916012_Citation_context_analysis_and_aging_patterns_of_journal_articles_in_molecular_genetics","240927395_Norms_and_functions_in_citation_The_view_of_journal_editors_and_referees_in_psychology","236035372_The_differences_between_latent_topics_in_abstracts_and_citation_contexts_of_citing_papers","234558912_Are_all_citations_equal_Or_Did_We_Op_Cit_Your_Idem","234451052_The_citation_process_The_role_and_significance_of_citations_in_scientific_communication","234402090_How_to_Write_and_Publish_a_Scientific_Paper","221013267_Automatic_classification_of_citation_function","220433834_Citation_Context_Versus_the_Frequency_Counts_of_Citation_Histories","220432634_Citation_behavior_Classification_utility_and_location","220364515_Normative_shaping_of_scientific_practice_The_magic_of_Merton","200016045_Citation_context_versus_the_frequency_counts_of_citation_histories","26840650_Automatically_Classifying_Sentences_in_Full-Text_Biomedical_Articles_into_Introduction_Methods_Results_and_Discussion","8464869_The_Introduction_Methods_Results_and_Discussion_IMRAD_Structure_a_fifty-year_survey"]}
