{"id":"292654509_News_as_entertainment_The_rise_of_global_infotainment","abstract":"Richly detailed and empirically grounded, this first book-length study of infotainment and its globalization by a leading scholar of global communication, offers a comprehensive and critical analysis of this emerging phenomenon. Going beyond - both geographically and theoretically - the ‘dumbing down’ discourse, largely confined to the Anglo-American media, the book argues that infotainment may have an important ideological role, a diversion in which ‘soft news’ masks the hard realities of neo-liberal imperialism.","authors":["Daya Thussu"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.4135/9781446220337"],"references":["249017059_Democratic_Hegemony_and_American_Hegemony","285663074_La_Nota_Roja_Popular_Journalism_and_the_Transition_to_Democracy_in_Mexico","272570077_Beyond_Public_Diplomacy","271744367_Pitch_Imperfect_The_Trouble_at_the_Voice_of_America","253449028_Winning_the_war_of_ideas","249809178_New_Europe's_Civil_Society_Democracy_and_the_Media_Thirteen_Years_After_The_Story_of_the_Czech_Republic","249671405_Counter-imaging_Myth-making_and_Americanization_in_Israeli_Labor_Party_campaign_ads_2003","240701390_The_formation_ofWorld_in_ActionA_case_study_in_the_history_of_current_affairs_journalism","240700272_Report_on_the_Conditions_of_Public_Service_Broadcasting","233676335_The_accidental_journalist_Shifting_professional_boundaries_in_the_wake_of_Leonardo_DiCaprio's_interview_with_former_President_Clinton","233258436_Inventing_Africa_in_the_Twentieth_Century_Cultural_Imagination_Politics_and_Transnationalism_in_Drum_Magazine","228043701_News_as_Ideology_Economic_Statistics_and_Political_Ritual_in_Television_Network_News"]}
