{"id":"330428201_Black-Box_Quantum_State_Preparation_without_Arithmetic","abstract":"Black-box quantum state preparation is an important subroutine in many quantum algorithms. The standard approach requires the quantum computer to do arithmetic, which is a key contributor to the complexity. Here we present a new algorithm that avoids arithmetic. We thereby reduce the number of gates by a factor of 286â€“374 over the best prior work for realistic precision; the improvement factor increases with the precision. As quantum state preparation is a crucial subroutine in many approaches to simulating physics on a quantum computer, our new method brings useful quantum simulation closer to reality.","authors":["Yuval Sanders","Guang Hao Low","Artur Scherer","Dominic W.
