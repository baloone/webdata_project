{"id":"233037782_Using_a_Computer_Algebra_System_to_Facilitate_the_Learning_of_Mathematical_Induction","abstract":"Mathematical induction is one of the major proof techniques taught to mathematics students in the first years of their undergraduate degrees. In addition to its importance to mathematics, induction is also required for computer science and related disciplines. However, even if the concepts of a proof by induction are taught and understood, many students fall down on the algebra required to prove the inductive step. Using a computer algebra system allows students to leap this particular hurdle, and thus expend more effort in understanding the concepts of proofs by induction. An added advantage is that students can prove statements requiring far messier algebra than is reasonable to expect them to do by hand.","authors":["Alasdair McAndrew"],"meta":["October 2010PRIMUS: problems, resources, and issues in mathematics undergraduate studies 20(7):591-602","DOI:10.1080/10511970802653217"],"references":["274293808_Mathematical_Induction_If_Student_k_Understands_It_Will_Student_k_1","261813412_Mathematical_Induction_or_What_Good_Is_All_This_Stuff_if_We_Are_Going_to_Assume_It's_True_Anyway","237500864_THE_USE_OF_MODELS_IN_TEACHING_PROOF_BY_MATHEMATICAL_INDUCTION"]}
