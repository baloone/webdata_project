{"id":"284097330_Semi-Inner-Products_for_Convex_Functionals_and_Their_Use_in_Image_Decomposition","abstract":"Semi-inner-products in the sense of Lumer are extended to convex functionals.\nThis yields a Hilbert-space like structure to convex functionals in Banach\nspaces. In particular, a general expression for semi-inner-products with\nrespect to one homogeneous functionals is given. Thus one can use the new\noperator for the analysis of total variation and higher order functionals like\ntotal-generalized-variation (TGV). Having a semi-inner-product, an angle\nbetween functions can be defined in a straightforward manner. It is shown that\nin the one homogeneous case the Bregman distance can be expressed in terms of\nthis newly defined angle. In addition, properties of the semi-inner-product of\nnonlinear eigenfunctions induced by the functional are derived. We use this\nconstruction to state a sufficient condition for a perfect decomposition of two\nsignals and suggest numerical measures which indicate when those conditions are\napproximately met.","authors":["Guy Gilboa"],"meta":["January 2017Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 57(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10851-016-0661-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["308692451_Flows_Generating_Nonlinear_Eigenfunctions","303376028_Bregman_Distances_in_Inverse_Problems_and_Partial_Differential_Equations","290527631_Spectral_Decompositions_Using_One-Homogeneous_Functionals","282639105_Nonlinear_Spectral_Analysis_via_One-Homogeneous_Functionals_Overview_and_Future_Prospects","277023438_Bregman_Distances_in_Inverse_Problems_and_Partial_Differential_Equation","273788292_Spectral_Representations_of_One-Homogeneous_Functionals","301822646_The_Split_Bregman_method_for_L1_regularized_problems","288927245_An_iterative_regularization_method_for_total_variation-based_image_restoration","280172665_A_Total_Variation_Spectral_Framework_for_Scale_and_Texture_Analysis","268628016_Convex_analysis_and_variational_problems_Unabridged_corrected_republication_of_the_1976_English_original","263402520_Ground_states_and_singular_vectors_of_convex_variational_regularization_methods","267438781_A_guide_to_the_TV_zoo","266551628_Mathematical_problems_in_image_processing_Partial_differential_equations_and_the_calculus_of_variations_Foreword_by_Olivier_Faugeras_2nd_ed","266224429_Scale-invariant_extinction_time_estimates_for_some_singular_diffusion_equations","265603357_Non-euclidean_Principal_Component_Analysis_for_Matrices_by_Hebbian_Learning"]}
