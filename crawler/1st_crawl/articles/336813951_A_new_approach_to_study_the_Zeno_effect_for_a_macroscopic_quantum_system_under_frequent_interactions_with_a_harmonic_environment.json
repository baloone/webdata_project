{"id":"336813951_A_new_approach_to_study_the_Zeno_effect_for_a_macroscopic_quantum_system_under_frequent_interactions_with_a_harmonic_environment","abstract":"Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno behaviors of a two-level macroscopic quantum system in interaction with a harmonic environment are studied using the perturbation theory. The system-environment interactions are applied in a successive and step-by-step way. A new expression for the probability of surviving the macrosystem in its initial state, after the Nth interaction step, is derived through a different method of calculation. It is shown that multiple transitions between Zeno and anti-Zeno behaviors can be found in our approach. We have shown that in addition to the environmental parameters like the Ohmicity, the macroscopic trait of the system also has a notable effect on the decay rate Γ(τ). Moreover, we have investigated how the decay rate Γ(τ) varies as the parameter of the macroscopicity of the system h˜ changes continuously in a given domain.","authors":["Fatemeh Ghasemi","Afshin Shafiee"],"meta":["October 2019Scientific Reports 9(1):15265","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-51729-1"],"references":["312912517_The_quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_with_strong_system-environment_coupling","306376487_Stochastic_quantum_Zeno-based_detection_of_noise_correlations","301835475_A_general_framework_for_the_Quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects","279458634_Quantum_Zeno_effect_in_parameter_estimation","279065834_Zeno_dynamics_in_quantum_open_systems","334271632_A_quantum_mechanical_approach_towards_the_calculation_of_transition_probabilities_between_DNA_codons","317847686_The_Quantum_Theory_of_Measurement","315655589_Quantum_Zeno_Effects_from_Measurement_Controlled_Qubit-Bath_Interactions","306204723_The_Zeno's_paradox_in_quantum_theory","279968574_Simulating_open_quantum_dynamics_with_time-dependent_variational_matrix_product_states_Towards_microscopic_correlation_of_environment_dynamics_and_reduced_system_evolution"]}
