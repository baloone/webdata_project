{"id":"289284681_Knowledge_BuildingKnowledge_ForumR_The_Transformation_of_Classroom_Discourse","abstract":"The goal of our chapter is to contribute to a better understanding of the new kind of learning: the place of computers, knowledge building, and progressive inquiry. We begin with a discussion of typical classroom discourse: IRE/F. Next, we examined how students and teachers used knowledge-building principles (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2003) supported by Knowledge Forum (Scardamalia, 2002) in understanding the problems of climate change. At a micro level of analysis, our research focused on the kinds of questions students asked and their subsequent discourse/explanation. We used grids developed by Hmelo-Silver and Barrows (2008) and a classification system developed by Hakkarainen (2003). Results showed a level of explanation in student discourse that contrasted sharply with the IRE classroom discourse structure (teacher initiated question - student response - teacher evaluation; see Cazden, 1988) and with the IRF structure (initiation - response - feedback; see Sinclair, Mc, & Coulthard, 1975; Wells, 1993). The emerging discourse pattern identified in this chapter is called IRFI (initiation - response - feedback/further inquiry).","authors":["Therese Laferriere","Mary Lamon"],"meta":["February 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4419-5716-0_24"],"references":["316806471_Dialogic_Education_and_Technology","283678078_Introduction_to_the_Handbook_of_Discourse_Processes","273230714_Effective_Participation_and_Discourse_through_a_Computer_Network_Investigating_Elementary_Students'_Computer_Supported_Interaction","265194197_Accountable_Talk_in_Reading_Comprehension_Instruction","254302040_Linking_Classroom_Discourse_and_Classroom_Content_Following_the_Trail_of_Intellectual_Work_in_a_Writing_Lesson","245919622_Dialogic_Inquiry_Towards_a_Sociocultural_Practice_and_Theory_of_Education","229344366_Reevaluating_the_IRF_Sequence_A_Proposal_for_the_Articulation_of_Theories_of_Activity_and_Discourse_for_the_Analysis_of_Teaching_and_Learning_in_the_Classroom","226095593_Students_assessing_their_own_collaborative_knowledge_building","225650170_Socio-cognitive_dynamics_of_knowledge_building_in_the_work_of_9-_and_10-year-olds","200773431_The_CSILE_project_Trying_to_bring_the_classroom_into_World_3","330695462_Curriculum_as_Conversation_Transforming_Traditions_of_Teaching_and_Learning","321300499_The_Cambridge_handbook_of_the_learning_sciences_second_edition","315118361_Story-Based_Learning_Environments","313219577_Fostering_communities_of_learners_and_knowledge_building_An_interrupted_dialogue","299534703_Classroom_discourse_analysis_A_functional_perspective","274660690_The_Advancement_of_Learning","265497485_Constructive_Learning_from_Texts_in_Biology","257925990_How_People_Learn_Mind_Brain_Experience_and_School","246668723_Learning_Lessons_The_Social_Organization_of_Classroom_Behavior","245667012_Classroom_Discourse_The_Language_of_Teaching_and_Learning","242606222_Surpassing_Ourselves_An_Inquiry_Into_the_Nature_and_Implications_of_Expertise","242459713_Towards_an_Analysis_of_Discourse_The_English_Used_by_Teachers_and_Pupils","240801223_Learning_Lessons_Social_Organization_in_the_Classroom","237132634_Words_and_Minds_How_We_Use_Language_to_Think_Together","234721056_Development_of_Scientific_Literacy_The_Evolution_of_Ideas_in_a_Grade_Four_Knowledge-Building_Classroom","227205741_Collaborative_Inquiry_and_Knowledge_Building_in_Networked_Multimedia_Environments","225831643_Explanations_from_intra-_and_inter-group_discourse_Students_building_knowledge_in_the_science_classroom","220934388_A_comparative_discourse_analysis_of_online_and_offline_knowledge_building_activities","220040893_Progressive_inquiry_in_a_computer-supported_biology_class","200773462_Designs_for_Collective_Cognitive_Responsibility_in_Knowledge-Building_Communities","200773218_Knowledge_building_Theory_pedagogy_and_technology","200773140_4_Collective_Cognitive_Responsibility_for_the_Advancement_of_Knowledge","200772896_Facilitating_Collaborative_Knowledge_Building","200772842_Computer_Support_for_Knowledge-Building_Communities","48132635_Analyzing_Teaching_Behavior","37691283_Curriculum_as_Conversation_Transforming_Traditions_of_Teaching_and_Learning"]}
