{"id":"291413168_Apposcopy_Semantic-based_detection_of_android_malware_through_static_analysis","abstract":"We present Apposcopy, a new semantics-based approach for identifying a prevalent class of Android malware that steals private user information. Apposcopy incorporates (i) a high-level language for specifying signatures that describe semantic characteristics of malware families and (ii) a static analysis for deciding if a given application matches a malware signature. The signature matching algorithm of Apposcopy uses a combination of static taint analysis and a new form of program representation called Inter-Component Call Graph to efficiently detect Android applications that have certain control- and data-flow properties. We have evaluated Apposcopy on a corpus of real-world Android applications and show that it can effectively and reliably pinpoint malicious applications that belong to certain malware families.","authors":["Yu Feng","Saswat Anand","Isil Dillig","Alex Aiken"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1145/2635868.2635869","Conference: the 22nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium"],"references":["267787299_Hey_You_Get_Off_of_My_Market_Detecting_Malicious_Apps_in_Official_and_Alternative_Android_Markets","264785935_DREBIN_Effective_and_Explainable_Detection_of_Android_Malware_in_Your_Pocket","262317298_Using_probabilistic_generative_models_for_ranking_risks_of_Android_apps","258903284_Structural_Detection_of_Android_Malware_using_Embedded_Call_Graphs","258566844_Resolving_and_Exploiting_the_k-CFA_Paradox","241623856_Detecting_Repackaged_Smartphone_Applications_in_Third-Party_Android_Marketplaces","234810332_Resolving_and_Exploiting_the_k-CFA_Paradox_Illuminating_Functional_vs_Object-Oriented_Program_Analysis","228728707_A_study_of_Android_application_security","221609170_On_Lightweight_Mobile_Phone_Application_Certification","221427523_Automatic_Generation_of_String_Signatures_for_Malware_Detection","221323151_Using_Datalog_with_Binary_Decision_Diagrams_for_Program_Analysis","221234535_Behavioral_detection_of_malware_on_mobile_handsets","221234511_Analyzing_Inter-Application_Communication_in_Android","220851714_TaintDroid_An_Information-Flow_Tracking_System_for_Realtime_Privacy_Monitoring_on_Smartphones","4141044_Semantics-Aware_Malware_Detection","2302886_Soot_-_a_Java_Bytecode_Optimization_Framework","306123933_Fast_scalable_detection_of_piggybacked_mobile_applications","289899636_AnDarwin_Scalable_Detection_of_Semantically_Similar_Android_Applications","278705505_DroidAPIMiner_Mining_API-Level_Features_for_Robust_Malware_Detection_in_Android","278691373_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","266653718_MAST_Triage_for_market-scale_mobile_malware_analysis","262371464_Hybrid_Context-Sensitivity_for_Points-To_Analysis","262330726_Fast_scalable_detection_of_Piggybacked_mobile_applications","262255906_AndroidLeaks_Automatically_Detecting_Potential_Privacy_Leaks_in_Android_Applications_on_a_Large_Scale","262248051_Slicing_droids_Program_slicing_for_smali_code","262170478_CHEX_Statically_vetting_Android_apps_for_component_hijacking_vulnerabilities","262165268_Permission_Use_Analysis_for_Vetting_Undesirable_Behaviors_in_Android_Apps","261852541_Effective_inter-component_communication_mapping_in_Android_with_Epicc_an_essential_step_towards_holistic_security_analysis","258631044_DroidChameleon_Evaluating_Android_anti-malware_against_transformation_attacks","254463014_RiskRanker_Scalable_and_Accurate_Zero-day_Android","236980396_Highly_Precise_Taint_Analysis_for_Android_Applications","228847936_SCanDroid_Automated_security_certification_of_Android_applications","228663097_Parameterized_object_sensitivity_for_points-to_analysis_for_Java","221655457_PiOS_Detecting_Privacy_Leaks_in_iOS_Applications","220403775_Parameterized_Object_Sensitivity_for_Points-to_Analysis_for_Java","213888338_Program_Analysis_and_Specialization_for_the_C_Programming_Language","30006454_Soot_a_java_bytecode_optimization_framework"]}
