{"id":"221345789_Reinforcement_learning_for_optimized_trade_execution","abstract":"We present the first large-scale empirical application of reinforcement learning to the important problem of optimized trade execution in modern financial markets. Our experiments are based on 1.5 years of millisecond time-scale limit order data from NASDAQ, and demonstrate the promise of reinforcement learning methods to market microstructure problems. Our learning algorithm introduces and exploits a natural \"low-impact\" factorization of the state space.","authors":["Yuriy Nevmyvaka","Yi Feng","Michael Kearns"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.1145/1143844.1143929","SourceDBLP","Conference: Machine Learning, Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference (ICML 2006), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, June 25-29, 2006"],"references":["225453208_Optimal_Search_and_One-Way_Trading_Online_Algorithms","4182320_Electronic_trading_in_order-driven_markets_Efficient_execution","262216234_Optimal_Control_of_Execution_Costs_for_Portfolios","247065779_Optimal_Execution_of_Portfolio_Transactions","221444860_Competitive_Algorithms_for_VWAP_and_Limit_Order_Trading","37597956_Modeling_Stock_Order_Flows_and_Learning_Market-Making_from_Data","37597911_An_Electronic_Market-Maker","4951156_Optimal_Control_of_Execution_Costs","4013374_Optimal_trade_execution_of_equities_in_a_limit_order_market","2327914_Optimal_Execution_of_Portfolio_Transactions"]}
