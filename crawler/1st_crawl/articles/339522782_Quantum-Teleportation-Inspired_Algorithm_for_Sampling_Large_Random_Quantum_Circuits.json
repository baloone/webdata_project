{"id":"339522782_Quantum-Teleportation-Inspired_Algorithm_for_Sampling_Large_Random_Quantum_Circuits","abstract":"Quantum teleportation transfers and processes quantum information through quantum entanglement channels. It is one of the most versatile protocols in quantum information science and leads to many remarkable applications, particularly the one-way quantum computing. Here, we show, for the first time, that the concept of teleportation can also be used to facilitate an important classical computing task, sampling random quantum circuits, which is highly relevant to prove the near-term demonstration of quantum computational supremacy. In our method, the classical computation in the physical-qubit state space is converted to simulate teleportation in logical-qubit state space, resulting in a much smaller number of qubits involved in classical computing. We tested this new method on 1D and 2D lattices up to 1000 qubits. This Letter presents a new quantum-inspired classical computing technology and is helpful to design and optimize classically hard quantum sampling experiments.","authors":["Ming-cheng Chen","Riling Li","Lin Gan","Xiaobo Zhu"],"meta":["February 2020Physical Review Letters 124(8)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.080502"],"references":["328581827_On_the_complexity_and_verification_of_quantum_random_circuit_sampling","323302402_64-Qubit_Quantum_Circuit_Simulation","322243414_Quantum_Computing_in_the_NISQ_era_and_beyond","320177251_Classical_boson_sampling_algorithms_with_superior_performance_to_near-term_experiments","319953599_A_blueprint_for_demonstrating_quantum_supremacy_with_superconducting_qubits","305780465_Characterizing_Quantum_Supremacy_in_Near-Term_Devices","304341531_The_Sunway_TaihuLight_supercomputer_system_and_applications","301881025_Hand-waving_and_Interpretive_Dance_An_Introductory_Course_on_Tensor_Networks","261837868_Superconducting_quantum_circuits_at_the_surface_code_threshold_for_fault_tolerance","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","11955500_A_One-Way_Quantum_Computer","8951276_Pseudo-Random_Unitary_Operators_for_Quantum_Information_Processing","7611126_Simulated_Quantum_Computation_of_Molecular_Energies","2196898_Simulating_Quantum_Computation_by_Contracting_Tensor_Networks","319683740_Hardware-efficient_variational_quantum_eigensolver_for_small_molecules_and_quantum_magnets","319683732_Quantum_Computational_Supremacy","305889363_High-Fidelity_Quantum_Logic_Gates_Using_Trapped-Ion_Hyperfine_Qubits","301879398_High-Fidelity_Universal_Gate_Set_for_9Be_Ion_Qubits","242254893_Parameters_of_pseudorandom_quantum_circuits","38082160_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Linear_Systems_of_Equations"]}
