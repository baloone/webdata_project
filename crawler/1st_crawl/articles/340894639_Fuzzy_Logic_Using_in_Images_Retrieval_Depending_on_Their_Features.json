{"id":"340894639_Fuzzy_Logic_Using_in_Images_Retrieval_Depending_on_Their_Features","abstract":"Image processing has become one of the most important branches of computer science, especially after entering into several areas of life such as medicine, engineering and various sciences. In our current research, we have developed a system of image recognition based on image characteristics and some content information using the most important artificial intelligence algorithms, a fuzzy logic algorithm, to obtain complete image information using small values ranging from 0 to 1. The program was executed on a set of standard database called the WANG database. It holds the contents of 1000 images from the Corel stock photo database, in JPEG format. The system was evaluated using the recall method. This method calculates the proportion of correct results identified by the system as correct results with correct result identified by the classic system.","authors":["Faiez Al-Rufaye","Mohammed Muanis I.
