{"id":"305973094_Smile_Asymptotics_II_Models_with_Known_Moment_Generating_Functions","abstract":"The tail of risk neutral returns can be related explicitly with the wing behaviour of the Black-Scholes implied volatility smile. In situations where precise tail asymptotics are unknown but a moment generating function is available we establish, under easy-to-check Tauberian conditions, tail asymptotics on logarithmic scales. Such asymptotics are enough to make the tail-wing formula (see Benaim and Friz (2008)) work and so we obtain, under generic conditions, a limiting slope when plotting the square of the implied volatility against the log strike, improving a lim sup statement obtained earlier by Lee (2004). We apply these results to time-changed exponential LÃ©vy models and examine several popular models in more detail, both analytically and numerically.","authors":["Shalom Benaim","Peter Friz"],"meta":["March 2008Journal of Applied Probability 45(01):16-32","DOI:10.1017/S0021900200003922"],"references":["229107695_Normal_Variance-Mean_Mixtures_and_z_Distributions","4776979_The_Moment_Formula_for_Implied_Volatility_at_Extreme_Strikes"]}
