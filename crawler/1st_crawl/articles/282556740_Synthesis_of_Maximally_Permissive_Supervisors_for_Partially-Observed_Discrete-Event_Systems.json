{"id":"282556740_Synthesis_of_Maximally_Permissive_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","abstract":"We present new results on the synthesis of safe, non-blocking, and maximally permissive supervisors for partially observed discrete event systems. We consider the case where the legal language is a non-prefix-closed sublanguage of the system language and non-blockingness must be ensured in addition to safety. Our approach is based on the construction of a new bipartite transition system, called the Non-blocking All Inclusive Controller (NB-AIC), that embeds all safe and non-blocking supervisors. We present an algorithm for the construction of the NB-AIC and discuss its properties. We then provide a synthesis algorithm, based on the NB-AIC, that constructs a supervisor that is safe, non-blocking and maximally permissive. This is the first algorithm with such properties.","authors":["Xiang Yin","Stephane Lafortune"],"meta":["May 2016IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 61(5):1239-1254","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2015.2460391"],"references":["269053267_On_relative_observability_of_discrete-event_systems","251396842_Supervisory_control_of_discrete_event_processes","248675526_Supervisory_control_of_a_class_of_discrete_event_systems","237092109_Relative_Observability_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_and_Its_Supremal_Sublanguages","288688798_A_General_Approach_for_Synthesis_of_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","239374368_Effective_computation_of_an_L_m_G-closed_controllable_and_observable_sublanguage_arising_in_supervisory_control","227180594_On-line_control_of_partially_observed_discrete_event_systems","227165048_On_supremal_languages_of_classes_of_sublanguages_that_arise_in_supervisor_synthesis_problems_with_partial_observation","225117659_Nondeterministic_supervision_under_partial_observations","224682826_On_the_Control_of_Discrete_Event_Dynamical_Systems"]}
