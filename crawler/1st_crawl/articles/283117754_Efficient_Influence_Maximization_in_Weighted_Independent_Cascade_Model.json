{"id":"283117754_Efficient_Influence_Maximization_in_Weighted_Independent_Cascade_Model","abstract":"Influence maximization(IM) problem is to find a seed set in a social network\nwhich achieves the maximal influence spread. This problem plays an important\nrole in viral marketing. Numerous models have been proposed to solve this\nproblem. However, none of them considers the attributes of nodes. Paying all\nattention to the structure of network causes some trouble applying these models\nto real-word applications.\nMotivated by this, we present weighted independent cascade (WIC) model, a\nnovel cascade model which extends the applicability of independent cascade(IC)\nmodel by attaching attributes to the nodes. The IM problem in WIC model is to\nmaximize the value of nodes which are influenced. This problem is NP-hard. To\nsolve this problem, we present a basic greedy algorithm and Weight Reset(WR)\nalgorithm. Moreover, we propose Bounded Weight Reset(BWR) algorithm to make\nfurther effort to improve the efficiency by bounding the diffusion node\ninfluence. We prove that BWR is a fully polynomial-time approximation\nscheme(FPTAS). Experimentally, we show that with additional node attribute, the\nsolution achieved by WIC model outperforms that of IC model in nearly 90%. The\nexperimental results show that BWR can achieve excellent approximation and\nfaster than greedy algorithm more than three orders of magnitude with little\nsacrifice of accuracy. Especially, BWR can handle large networks with millions\nof nodes in several tens of seconds while keeping rather high accuracy. Such\nresult demonstrates that BWR can solve IM problem effectively and efficiently.","authors":["Yaxuan Wang","Hongzhi Wang","Jianzhong Li"],"meta":["October 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261369038_Influence_Maximization_Near-Optimal_Time_Complexity_Meets_Practical_Efficiency","242914003_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions-I","229025007_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks_When_Negative_Opinions_May_Emerge_and_Propagate","227444614_Location_of_Bank_Accounts_to_Optimize_Float_An_Analytic_Study_of_Exact_and_Approximate_Algorithms","221654678_Cost-effective_outbreak_detection_in_networks","221653723_Scalable_Influence_Maximization_for_Prevalent_Viral_Marketing_in_Large-Scale_Social_Networks","221022416_CELF_Optimizing_the_greedy_algorithm_for_influence_maximization_in_social_networks","220853236_Threshold_Models_for_Competitive_Influence_in_Social_Networks","220765221_SIMPATH_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Influence_Maximization_under_the_Linear_Threshold_Model","51946939_Influence_Blocking_Maximization_in_Social_Networks_under_the_Competitive_Linear_Threshold_Model_Technical_Report","51942254_A_Data-Based_Approach_to_Social_Influence_Maximization","2477877_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_through_a_Social_Network","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","276465177_Inferring_continuous_dynamic_social_influence_and_personal_preference_for_temporal_behavior_prediction","265373727_Richard_von_Mises_1883-1953_a_pioneer_of_applied_mathematics_in_four_countries","260558454_CT-IC_Continuously_Activated_and_Time-Restricted_Independent_Cascade_Model_for_Viral_Marketing","246106899_Eva_Tardos_Maximizing_the_spread_of_influence_through_a_social_network","225246148_An_analysis_of_approximations_for_maximizing_submodular_set_functions-II","224574578_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems_IEEE_Computer_Journal_428_30-37","224014491_Time-Critical_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks_withTime-Delayed_Diffusion_Process","221653371_Community-based_Greedy_algorithm_for_mining_top-K_influential_nodes_in_mobile_social_networks","221653337_Efficient_influence_maximization_in_social_networks","220555475_Approximation_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","216634741_The_Small_World_Problem","200047922_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","51957083_Influence_Diffusion_Dynamics_and_Influence_Maximization_in_SocialNetworks_with_Friend_and_Foe_Relationships","45378510_Effects_of_Word-of-Mouth_Versus_Traditional_Marketing_Findings_from_an_Internet_Social_Networking_Site","12179403_The_structure_of_scientific_collaboration_networks","2537078_Mining_Knowledge-Sharing_Sites_for_Viral_Marketing","2379126_Mining_the_Network_Value_of_Customers"]}
