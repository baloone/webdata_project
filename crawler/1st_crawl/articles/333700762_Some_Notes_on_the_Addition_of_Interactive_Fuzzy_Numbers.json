{"id":"333700762_Some_Notes_on_the_Addition_of_Interactive_Fuzzy_Numbers","abstract":"This paper investigates some fundamental questions involving additions of interactive fuzzy numbers. The notion of interactivity between two fuzzy numbers, say A and B, is described by a joint possibility distribution J. One can define a fuzzy number (or ), called J-interactive sum (or difference) of A and B, in terms of the sup-J extension principle of the addition (or difference) operator of the real numbers. In this article we address the following three questions: (1) Given fuzzy numbers B and C, is there a fuzzy number X and a joint possibility distribution J of X and B such that ? (2) Given fuzzy numbers A, B, and C, is there a joint possibility distribution J of A and B such that ? (3) Given a joint possibility distribution J of fuzzy numbers A and B, is there a joint possibility distribution N of and B such that ? It is worth noting that these questions are trivially answered in the case where the fuzzy numbers A, B and C are real numbers, since the fuzzy arithmetic and are extension of the classical arithmetic for real numbers.","authors":["Estevão Esmi","Laécio Carvalho de Barros","Vinícius Wasques"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-21920-8_23","In book: Fuzzy Techniques: Theory and Applications, Proceedings of the 2019 Joint World Congress of the International Fuzzy Systems Association and the Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society IFSA/NAFIPS'2019 (Lafayette, Louisiana, USA, June 18–21, 2019) (pp.246-257)","Project: Collaborations"],"references":["254455742_Generalized_Differentiability_of_Fuzzy-valued_Functions","222744294_Generalized_Hukuhara_differentiability_of_interval-valued_functions_and_interval_differential_equations","239331437_A_note_on_the_extension_principle_for_fuzzy_set","237076939_Differentials_of_fuzzy_functions_1","222530276_On_interactive_fuzzy_numbers","3029169_Addition_of_interactive_fuzzy_numbers"]}
