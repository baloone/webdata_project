{"id":"277096912_A_Note_on_Tensor_Product_of_Graphs","abstract":"Let G and H be graphs. The tensor product G⊗H of G and H has vertex set V (G ⊗ H) = V (G) × V (H) and edge set E(G ⊗ H) = {(a, b)(c, d)⌊ac ∈ E(G) and bd ∈ E(H)}. In this paper, some results on this product are obtained by which it is possible to compute the Wiener and Hyper Wiener indices of K n ⊗ G. © 2012 Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research TMU.","authors":["Sirous Moradi"],"meta":["May 2012Iranian Journal of Mathematical Sciences and Informatics 7(1)"],"references":["267431141_The_Hyper-Wiener_Polynomial_of_Graphs","220112433_Some_Remarks_on_the_Kronecker_Product_of_Graphs","27212118_The_Edge_Szeged_Index_of_Product_Graphs","257293954_Distance_regularity_of_compositions_of_graphs","223664726_The_PI_index_of_product_graphs","221953326_A_matrix_method_for_computing_Szeged_and_vertex_PI_indices_of_join_and_composition_of_graphs"]}
