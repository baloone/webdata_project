{"id":"323330826_What_We_Can_Learn_About_Student_Learning_From_Open-Ended_Programming_Projects_in_Middle_School_Computer_Science","abstract":"Block-based programming environments such as Scratch, App Inventor, and Alice are a key part of introductory K-12 computer science (CS) experiences. Free-choice, open-ended projects are encouraged to promote learner agency and leverage the affordances of these novice-programming environments that also support creative engagement in CS. This mixed methods research examines what we can learn about student learning from such programming artifacts. Using an extensive rubric created to evaluate these projects along several dimensions, we coded a sample of ~80 Scratch and App Inventor projects randomly selected from 20 middle school classrooms in a diverse urban school district in the US. We present key elements of our rubric, and report on noteworthy trends including the types of artifacts created and which key programming constructs are or are not commonly used. We also report on how factors such as students' gender, grade, and teachers' teaching experience influenced students' projects. We discuss differences between programming environments in terms of artifacts created, use of computing constructs, complexity of projects, and use of features of the environment for creativity, interactivity, and engagement. Our findings will help educators of introductory computing be more cognizant of how best to leverage the programming environments they are using, and what aspects they need to focus on as they attempt to address the learning needs of all in \"CS For All.\"","authors":["Shuchi Grover","Satabdi Basu","Patricia Schank"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1145/3159450.3159522","Conference: the 49th ACM Technical Symposium","Project: Introductory Programming"],"references":["331685999_Should_All_Computational_Tools_Be_Treated_Equal_Comparing_The_Affordances_Of_K-12_Computing_Education_Tools","319325770_A_Framework_for_Using_Hypothesis-Driven_Approaches_to_Support_Data-Driven_Learning_Analytics_in_Measuring_Computational_Thinking_in_Block-Based_Programming_Environments","316442298_Assessing_Algorithmic_and_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_Lessons_from_a_Middle_School_Classroom","309917255_Skill_progression_in_MIT_app_inventor","301429274_Programming_in_the_wild_Patterns_of_Computational_Participation_in_the_Scratch_Online_Social_Networking_Forum","276852167_Designing_for_deeper_learning_in_a_blended_computer_science_course_for_middle_school_students","317160209_Learnable_Programming_Blocks_and_Beyond","311473376_Unlocking_the_clubhouse_women_in_computing","298972479_Learning_Computer_Science_Concepts_with_Scratch","277374591_Lowering_the_barriers_to_programming"]}
