{"id":"308778488_Risk_Identification_Ontology_RIO_An_ontology_for_specification_and_identification_of_perioperative_risks","abstract":"Medical personnel in hospitals often works under great physical and mental strain. In medical decision making, errors can never be completely ruled out. Studies exposed that between 50 and 60 percent of adverse events could have been avoided through better organization, more attention or more effective security procedures. Critical situations especially arise during interdisciplinary collaboration and the use of complex medical technology, for example during surgical interventions and in perioperative settings. In this paper we present an ontology and an ontology-based software system which can identify risks across medical processes and which supports the avoidance of errors in the perioperative setting in particular.\n\nhttp://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1692/paperG.pdf","authors":["Alexandr Uciteli","Juliane Neumann","Kais Tahar","Kutaiba Saleh"],"meta":["September 2016","Conference: ODLS 2016 – Ontologies and Data in Life SciencesAt: Halle, GermanyVolume: CEUR-WS Volume 1692","Projects: OntomedRiskOntoMedRisk – Development of an ontology-based software solution for perioperative risk minimization"],"references":["281654729_Axiomatic_theories_of_the_ontology_of_time_in_GFO","263785629_OAE_The_Ontology_of_Adverse_Events","258953828_The_Ontology_of_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_OVAE_and_its_usage_in_representing_and_analyzing_adverse_events_associated_with_US-licensed_human_vaccines","247936637_General_Formal_Ontology_GFO_-_A_Foundational_Ontology_Integrating_Objects_and_Processes_Version_10","226549712_General_Formal_Ontology_GFO_A_Foundational_Ontology_for_Conceptual_Modelling","200656918_To_Err_is_Human_Building_a_Safer_Health_System","10635747_Risk_of_Bacterial_Meningitis_in_Children_with_Cochlear_Implants","304414558_Conceptual_ontology_of_prospective_risk_analysis_in_medical_environments_-_the_OPT-Model-Ontology","292139252_Computing_Instantiated_Explanations_in_OWL_DL","291340319_From_To_Err_Is_Human_to_Improving_Diagnosis_in_Health_Care_The_risk_management_perspective","274430445_Towards_an_Eliminative_Reduction_of_Possible_Worlds","262282993_Toward_cognitive_support_for_OWL_justifications","261638596_Construction_of_a_Clinical_Decision_Support_System_for_Undergoing_Surgery_Based_on_Domain_Ontology_and_Rules_Reasoning","243783274_On_The_Quantitative_Definition_of_Risk","243452050_Situations_and_Attitudes","227254410_Zentral-auditorische_Implantate","226798955_Possible_Worlds_and_Situations","224593286_Development_of_an_ontology_for_a_preoperative_risk_assessment_clinical_decision_support_system","221466866_Finding_All_Justifications_of_OWL_DL_Entailments","221466351_The_Cognitive_Complexity_of_OWL_Justifications","221211713_A_Hybrid_Architecture_for_a_Preoperative_Decision_Support_System_Using_a_Rule_Engine_and_a_Reasoner_on_a_Clinical_Ontology","220283677_Using_OWL_ontologies_for_adaptive_patient_information_modelling_and_preoperative_clinical_decision_support","44676047_Critical_Incident_Reporting_and_Learning","12254624_Adverse_drug_reactions_Definitions_diagnosis_and_management","2839199_Twenty-Five_Basic_Theorems_in_Situation_and_World_Theory"]}
