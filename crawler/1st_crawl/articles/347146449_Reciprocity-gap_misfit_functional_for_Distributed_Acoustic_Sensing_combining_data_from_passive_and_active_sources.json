{"id":"347146449_Reciprocity-gap_misfit_functional_for_Distributed_Acoustic_Sensing_combining_data_from_passive_and_active_sources","abstract":"Quantitative imaging of sub-surface Earthâ€™s properties in elastic media is performed from Distributed Acoustic Sensing data. A new misfit functional based upon the reciprocity-gap is designed, taking cross-correlations of displacement and strain, and these products further associate an observation with a simulation. In comparison with other misfit functionals, this one has the advantage to only require little a-priori information on the exciting sources. In particular, the misfit criterion enables the use of data from regional earthquakes (teleseismic events can be included as well), followed by exploration data to perform a multi-resolution reconstruction. The data from regional earthquakes contain the low-frequency content which is missing in the exploration ones, allowing for the recovery of the long spatial wavelength, even with very few sources. These data are used to build prior models for the subsequent reconstruction from the higher-frequency exploration data. This gives the elastic Full Reciprocity-gap Waveform Inversion method, and we demonstrate its performance with a pilot experiment for elastic isotropic reconstruction.","authors":["Florian
