{"id":"351987701_Augmenting_Ontology_Alignment_by_Semantic_Embedding_and_Distant_Supervision","abstract":"Ontology alignment plays a critical role in knowledge integration and has been widely investigated in the past decades. State of the art systems, however, still have considerable room for performance improvement especially in dealing with new (industrial) alignment tasks. In this paper we present a machine learning based extension to traditional ontology alignment systems, using distant supervision for training, ontology embedding and Siamese Neural Networks for incorporating richer semantics. We have used the extension together with traditional systems such as LogMap and AML to align two food ontologies, HeLiS and FoodOn, and we found that the extension recalls many additional valid mappings and also avoids some false positive mappings. This is also verified by an evaluation on alignment tasks from the OAEI conference track.","authors":["Jiaoyan Chen","Ernesto Jim√©nez-Ruiz","Ian Horrocks","Denvar Antonyrajah"],"meta":["May 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-77385-4_23","In book: The Semantic Web (pp.392-408)"],"references":["352467347_OWL2Vec_embedding_of_OWL_ontologies","345454150_Semantic_similarity_and_machine_learning_with_ontologies","339336050_Dividing_the_Ontology_Alignment_Task_with_Semantic_Embeddings_and_Logic-based_Modules","333009934_Simulated_Annealing-based_Ontology_Matching","330366272_Results_of_the_Ontology_Alignment_Evaluation_Initiative_2018","329348621_FoodOn_a_harmonized_food_ontology_to_increase_global_food_traceability_quality_control_and_data_integration","301445902_ERSOM_A_Structural_Ontology_Matching_Approach_Using_Automatically_Learned_Entity_Representation","286532961_Large-scale_interactive_ontology_matching_Algorithms_and_implementation","262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","221466079_LogMap_Logic-Based_and_Scalable_Ontology_Matching","2634460_Similarity_Search_in_High_Dimensions_via_Hashing","346238099_DeepFCA_Matching_Biomedical_Ontologies_Using_Formal_Concept_Analysis_Embedding_Techniques","334115577_Ontology_alignment_in_the_biomedical_domain_using_entity_definitions_and_context","330462403_Ontology_Alignment_Based_on_Word_Embedding_and_Random_Forest_Classification_Recognizing_Outstanding_PhD_Research","327713145_HeLiS_An_Ontology_for_Supporting_Healthy_Lifestyles_17th_International_Semantic_Web_Conference_Monterey_CA_USA_October_8-12_2018_Proceedings_Part_II","325447093_DeepAlignment_Unsupervised_Ontology_Matching_with_Refined_Word_Vectors","319947524_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding_A_Survey_of_Approaches_and_Applications","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","289458252_To_repair_or_not_to_repair_Reconciling_correctness_and_coherence_in_ontology_reference_alignments","278658640_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","266561523_Ontology_matching_A_literature_review","265555564_Hermit_An_Owl_2_Reasoner","265519365_The_AgreementMakerLight_Ontology_Matching_System","260324688_Ontology_Matching_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Challenges","2857635_Ontology_Matching_A_Machine_Learning_Approach"]}
