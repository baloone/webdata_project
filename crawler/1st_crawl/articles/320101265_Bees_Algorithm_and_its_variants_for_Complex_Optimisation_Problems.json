{"id":"320101265_Bees_Algorithm_and_its_variants_for_Complex_Optimisation_Problems","abstract":"The Bees Algorithm (BA) is a swarm-based meta-heuristic that imitates the foraging behaviour of bees for solving problems involving optimization and finding the optimal solution. It equilibrates between local neighbourhood search (i.e. exploitation) and global random search (i.e. exploration). The purpose of this paper is to describe the BA and its principles. The improved versions of BA are presented by introducing two approaches that enhance the accuracy and speed of the search, the neighbourhood shrinking method and the site abandonment. The advantages and limitations of BA according to the optimization problems are presented. In this work, the performance and speed of the BA and their two variants is analysed on several of complexes analytical functions from the literature and compared to other biologically-inspired optimization search algorithms. The results obtained prove the effectiveness and robustness of the BA regarding accuracy and speed.","authors":["Mohamed Amine Nemmich","Debbat Fatima"],"meta":["September 2017","Conference: The 2nd International Conference on Applied Automation and Industrial Diagnostics, ICAAID 2017At: Djelfa, Algeria","Project: Bio-inspired Foraging Models for Solving Resource Constrained Optimization Problems"],"references":["259383112_Honey_Bees_Inspired_Optimization_Method_The_Bees_Algorithm","253611651_The_Bees_Algorithm_-_A_Novel_Tool_for_Complex_Optimisation_Problems","229704833_Dynamic_optimisation_by_a_modified_bees_algorithm","229698041_The_Bees_Algorithm_Modelling_foraging_behaviour_to_solve_continuous_optimization_problems","282660987_A_comparative_study_of_the_Bees_Algorithm_as_a_tool_for_function_optimisation","231393913_Ant_Colony_Approach_to_Continuous_Function_Optimization"]}
