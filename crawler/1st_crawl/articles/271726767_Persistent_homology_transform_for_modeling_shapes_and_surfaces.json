{"id":"271726767_Persistent_homology_transform_for_modeling_shapes_and_surfaces","abstract":"We introduce a statistic, the persistent homology transform (PHT), to model surfaces in ${\\mathbb { R}}^3$ and shapes in ${\\mathbb { R}}^2$. This statistic is a collection of persistence diagramsâ€”multiscale topological summaries used extensively in topological\ndata analysis. We use the PHT to represent shapes and execute operations such as computing distances between shapes or classifying\nshapes. We provide a constructive proof that the map from the space of simplicial complexes in ${\\mathbb { R}}^3$ into the space spanned by this statistic is injective. This implies that we can use it to determine a metric on the space\nof piecewise linear shapes. Stability results justify that we can approximate this metric using finitely many persistence\ndiagrams. We illustrate the utility of this statistic on simulated and real data.","authors":["Katharine Felicity Turner","Sayan Mukherjee","Doug M Boyer"],"meta":["January 2014Information and Inference A Journal of the IMA 3(4):310-344","DOI:10.1093/imaiai/iau011"],"references":["284388259_Framework_for_the_statistical_shape_analysis_of_brain_structures_using_SPHARM-PDM","269934848_A_New_Fully_Automated_Approach_for_Aligning_and_Comparing_Shapes","313060900_Large_sample_theory_of_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_sample_means_on_manifolds","305978777_The_second-order_analysis_of_stationary_point_processes","275801949_Multidimensional_Scaling","273239549_Morphometric_Tools_for_Landmark_Data_Geometry_and_Biology","268627155_Statistical_Shape_Analysis","267444847_The_Likelihood_Principle","267149670_Introduction_to_Geometric_Probability","265726494_Morphometric_Tools_For_Landmark_Data_Geometry_and_Biology"]}
