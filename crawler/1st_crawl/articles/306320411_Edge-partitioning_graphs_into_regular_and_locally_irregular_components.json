Recently, Baudon et al. introduced the notion of decomposition into locally irregular subgraphs. They conjectured that for almost every graph $G$, there exists a minimum integer $\\chi^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{irr}}(G)$ such that $G$ admits an edge-partition into $\\chi^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{irr}}(G)$ classes, each of which induces a locally irregular graph. In particular, they conjectured that $\\chi^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{irr}}(G) \\leq 3$ for every $G$, unless $G$ belongs to a well-characterized family of non-decomposable graphs. This conjecture is far from being settled, as notably (1) no constant upper bound on$\\chi^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{irr}}(G)$ is known for $G$ bipartite, and (2) no satisfactory general upper bound on $\\chi^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{irr}}(G)$ is known. We herein investigate the consequences on this question of allowing a decomposition to include regular components as well. As a main result, we prove that every bipartite graph admits such a decomposition into at most $6$ subgraphs. This result implies that every graph $G$ admits a decomposition into at most $6(\\lfloor \\mathrm{log} \\chi (G) \\rfloor +1)$ subgraphs whose components are regular or locally irregular.","authors":["Julien Bensmail","Brett Stevens"],"meta":["February 2016Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS Vol. 17 no. 3(Graph Theory)","DOI:10.46298/dmtcs.2154"],"references":["272199959_On_the_complexity_of_determining_the_irregular_chromatic_index_of_a_graph","275059329_On_decomposing_regular_graphs_into_locally_irregular_subgraphs","242530345_On_an_estimate_of_the_chromatic_class_of_a_p-graph_In_Russian","221590732_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_Problems","220779161_Embedding_Planar_Graphs_on_the_Grid","220074779_Vertex_coloring_edge_partitions"]}
