{"id":"343598065_Subjective_Product_Evaluation_System_Based_on_Kansei_Engineering_and_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process","abstract":"Product evaluation is very important for product improvement and development, and subjective product evaluation determines customer’s evaluation of products to some extent, so the purpose of this study is to establish a reasonable subjective product evaluation system. In this study, we comprehensively determine the evaluation indexes based on Kansei engineering (KE), establish an overall product evaluation system by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and establish the subjective product evaluation system by classifying the evaluation indexes in the overall product evaluation system into “objective evaluation index” and “subjective evaluation index”, removing the objective evaluation indexes, and retaining the subjective evaluation indexes. Additionally, we select some modern chairs as experimental samples to verify the reliability and validity of this subjective product evaluation system by means of questionnaires. The experimental results show that, in this subjective product evaluation system, the subjective evaluation of the product is positively correlated with the “favorite” level of the product in comprehensive evaluation, and negatively correlated with the “least favorite” level of the product in comprehensive evaluation, indicating that this subjective product evaluation system realizes a symmetry between subjective product evaluation and comprehensive product evaluation. Therefore, it can be concluded that this subjective product evaluation system based on KE and AHP proposed in this study has reliability and validity, and can be used for product evaluation to judge the popularity of products and enhance the competitiveness of products.","authors":["Zuo Yaxue","Zhenya Wang"],"meta":["August 2020Symmetry 12(8):1340","DOI:10.3390/sym12081340"],"references":["334220140_Personalized_Product_Evaluation_Based_on_GRA-TOPSIS_and_Kansei_Engineering","317587535_The_state_of_the_art_development_of_AHP_1979-2017_A_literature_review_with_a_social_network_analysis","313376142_Desk_and_chair_design_of_elementary_school_using_Kansei_engineering_and_conjoint_analysis","338850498_Kansei_Analysis_using_Analytical_Hierarchy_Process","324626520_The_Measurement_of_Meaning","322408316_Interface_modeling_for_mobile_learning_using_kansei_engineering_and_analytical_hierarchy_process","321157874_Multi-image_evaluation_for_human-machine_interface_based_on_Kansei_engineering","318301026_Advancing_the_strategic_impact_of_human-centred_design","314244642_A_personalized_recommendation_model_for_online_apparel_shopping_based_on_Kansei_engineering","308875737_Kansei_assessment_of_the_constituent_elements_and_the_overall_interrelations_in_car_steering_wheel_design"]}
