{"id":"325210186_Uncovering_Attribute-Driven_Active_Intimate_Communities","abstract":"Most existing studies in community detection either focus on the common attributes of the nodes (users) or rely on only the topological links of the social network graph. However, the bulk of literature ignores the interaction strength among the users in the retrieved communities. As a result, many members of the detected communities do not interact frequently to each other. This inactivity will create problem for online advertisers as they require the community to be highly interactive to efficiently diffuse marketing information. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting attribute-driven active intimate community, that is, for a given input query consisting a set of attributes, we want to find densely-connected communities in which community members actively participate as well as have strong interaction (intimacy) with respect to the given query attributes. We design a novel attribute relevance intimacy score function for the detected communities and establish its desirable properties. To this end, we use an indexed based solution to efficiently discover active intimate communities. Extensive experiments on real data sets show the effectiveness and performance of our proposed method.","authors":["Md Musfique Anwar","Chengfei Liu","Jianxin Li"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-92013-9_9","In book: Databases Theory and Applications (pp.109-122)"],"references":["295833445_An_interaction-based_approach_to_detecting_highly_interactive_Twitter_communities_using_tweeting_links","268171320_User_Interaction_Based_Community_Detection_in_Online_Social_Networks","243964012_The_Social_Media_Genome_Modeling_Individual_Topic-Specific_Behavior_in_Social_Media","317071791_Most_Influential_Community_Search_over_Large_Social_Networks","315959344_Geo-Social_Influence_Spanning_Maximization","307896708_Effective_community_search_for_large_attributed_graphs","298734549_Personalized_Influential_Topic_Search_via_Social_Network_Summarization","282296588_Hierarchical_community_detection_algorithm_based_on_local_similarity","262345056_Incremental_shared_nearest_neighbor_density-based_clustering","262272550_iTop_-_Interaction_based_topic_centric_community_discovery_on_twitter","257676486_Outlier_detection_from_large_distributed_databases","254581357_Satisfying_Privacy_Requirements_Before_Data_Anonymization","232625580_Dense_Subgraph_Extraction_with_Application_to_Community_Detection","220614609_Injecting_purpose_and_trust_into_data_anonymisation"]}
