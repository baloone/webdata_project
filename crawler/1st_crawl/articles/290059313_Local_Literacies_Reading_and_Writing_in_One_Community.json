{"id":"290059313_Local_Literacies_Reading_and_Writing_in_One_Community","abstract":"Local Literacies is a unique detailed study of the role of reading and writing in peopleâ€™s everyday lives. By concentrating on a selection of people in a particular community in Lancaster, England, the authors analyse how they use literacy in their day-to-day lives. It follows four people in detail examining how they use local media, their participation in public life, the role of literacy in family activities and in leisure pursuits. Links are made between everyday learning and education. The study is based on an ethnographic approach to studying everyday activities and is framed in the theory of literacy as a social practice.","authors":["David Barton","Mary E.
