{"id":"314385360_Cost_Management_Practices_and_Firm's_Performance_of_Manufacturing_Organizations","abstract":"This study investigates the relationship that exists between cost management practices and firm’s performance in the manufacturing organizations using data from 40 manufacturing companies listed on the Nigeria stock exchange during the period of 2003 to 2012. Four hypotheses were formulated for the study and tested using t-statistic. The study relied on secondary data extracted from the audited financial statement of the selected companies. Direct material cost, direct labour cost, production overhead cost and administrative overhead cost were taken as independent cost management variables while profitability (Operating profit) was taken as dependent variable representing the firm’s performance. The result indicates that a positive significant relationship exists between cost management practices and firm’s performance in the manufacturing organization. It is therefore recommended that a cost reduction strategy with emphasis on production overhead cost and administrative overhead cost should be embarked upon if their profit maximization and wealth creation objective must be achieved.","authors":["Ezekiel Oluwagbemiga Oyerogba","Olaleye Michael Olugbenga","Solomon Adeoluwa Zaccheaus"],"meta":["May 2014International Journal of Economics and Finance 6(6)","DOI:10.5539/ijef.v6n6p234"],"references":["275683418_Kaizen_Cost_Management_Technique_and_Profitability_of_Small_and_Medium_Scale_Enterprises_SMEs_in_Ogun_State_Nigeria","272803324_Product_Cost_Management_via_the_Kaizen_Costing_System_Perception_of_Accountants","268284725_5_1_Kaizen_Philosophy_A_Review_of_Literature_Kaizen_Philosophy_A_Review_of_Literature","267693357_STRATEGIC_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNTING_-_A_MESSIAH_FOR_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNTING","288395632_Women_entrepreneurship_in_micro_small_and_medium_enterprises_The_case_of_Ethiopia","285702015_Accounting_and_cost_management","284607124_Cost_Accounting_A_Managerial_Emphasis","245331546_Cost_management_through_product_design_Target_costing_approach","243784454_Cost_Accounting_A_Managerial_Emphasis","242677871_Control_Measures_for_Kaizen_Costing_-_Formulation_and_Practical_Use_of_the_Half-Life_Model"]}
