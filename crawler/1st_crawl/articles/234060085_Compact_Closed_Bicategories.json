{"id":"234060085_Compact_Closed_Bicategories","abstract":"A compact closed bicategory is a symmetric monoidal bicategory where every\nobject is equipped with a weak dual. The unit and counit satisfy the usual\n\"zig-zag\" identities of a compact closed category only up to natural\nisomorphism, and the isomorphism is subject to a coherence law.\nWe give several examples of compact closed bicategories, then review previous\nwork. In particular, Day and Street defined compact closed bicategories\nindirectly via Gray monoids and then appealed to a coherence theorem to extend\nthe concept to bicategories; we restate the definition directly, emphasizing\nthe combinatorics. Finally, we prove that each of the examples are compact\nclosed.\nWe prove that given a 2-category C with finite products and weak pullbacks,\nthe bicategory of objects of C, spans, and isomorphism classes of maps of spans\nis compact closed. We also prove that given a cocomplete symmetric monoidal\ncategory R whose tensor product distributes over its colimits, the bicategory\nMat(R) of natural numbers, matrices of objects of R and matrices of morphisms\nof R is compact closed. As corollaries, the bicategory of spans of sets, the\nbicategory of relations, and certain bicategories of \"resistor networks\" are\nall compact closed. We also give a new proof that the 2-category of small\ncategories, cocontinuous functors between the presheaves on those categories,\nand natural transformations is compact closed.","authors":["Michael Stay"],"meta":["January 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265437903_2-categories_and_Zamolodchikov_tetrahedra_equations","236682977_Linear_Logic_without_Units","231966472_Traced_monoidal_categories","228929750_Frobenius_monads_and_pseudomonoids","222529134_Higher-Dimensional_Algebra_IV_2-Tangles","220676552_Categorical_semantics_for_arrows","220608487_Functorial_Calculus_in_Monoidal_Bicategories","220173675_Profunctors_Open_Maps_and_Bisimulation","45910513_Constructing_symmetric_monoidal_bicategories","45859063_Polynomial_functors_and_polynomial_monads","29646735_Free_Compact_2-Categories","2265547_Higher-Dimensional_Algebra_III_n-Categories_and_the_Algebra_of_Opetopes","1970928_Exotic_Statistics_for_Strings_in_4d_BF_Theory","325438301_Homotopy_associativity_of_H-spaces_I","267081703_Cauchy_completion_in_category_theory","265771045_Monoidal_Bicategories_and_Hopf_Algebroids","252195112_Higher-Dimensional_Algebra_I_Braided_Monoidal_2Categories","251198025_Introduction_to_bicategories","248071064_Theory_and_Applications_of_Categories","245685068_Coherence_theorems_for_Lax_algebras_and_for_distributive_laws","243772753_Coherence_for_compact_closed_categories","243691225_On_the_classification_of_2-gerbes_and_2-stacks","240059474_Introduction_to_bicategories_In_Reports_of_the_Midwest_Category_Seminar","239403682_Analyse_algebrique_d''n_scrutin","238849487_Cartesian_bicategories_I","234785727_Arrows_are_strong_monads","228617930_Towards_an_n-category_of_cobordisms","228445689_The_Categorified_Heisenberg_Algebra_I_A_Combinatorial_Representation","225486912_On_closed_categories_of_functors","225214774_Coherence_for_distributivity","222688423_Objects_of_Categories_as_Complex_Numbers","222520426_Generalising_monads_to_arrows","222484883_Generalized_Centers_of_Braided_and_Sylleptic_Monoidal_2-Categories","222436132_The_Eckmann-Hilton_argument_and_higher_operads","222268288_Higher-Dimensional_Algebra_IIIn-Categories_and_the_Algebra_of_Opetopes","51961364_The_Classification_of_Two-Dimensional_Extended_Topological_FieldTheories","51960985_Spans_in_2-Categories_A_monoidal_tricategory","50332950_Formal_category_theory_adjoitness_for_2-categories","44454190_Formal_category_theory_adjointness_for_2-categories_John_Walker_Gray","35684248_An_algebraic_theory_of_tricategories","30449202_Analyse_algebrique_d'un_scrutin","2586058_Higher-Dimensional_Algebra_and_Topological_Quantum_Field_Theory","2396872_The_Compact_Closed_Bicategory_of_Left_Adjoints","2266637_On_Partita_Doppia","2210899_Double_Bicategories_and_Double_Cospans","2185437_Topological_Quantum_Computation","2135853_A_2-Categories_Companion","1760201_Cartesian_Bicategories_II"]}
