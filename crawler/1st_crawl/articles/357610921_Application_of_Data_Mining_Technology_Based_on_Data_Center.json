{"id":"357610921_Application_of_Data_Mining_Technology_Based_on_Data_Center","abstract":"Data mining technology refers to the use of mathematics, statistics, computer science and other methods to process a large amount of information to obtain useful conclusions and provide valuable decisions for people. With the rapid development and popularization of the Internet era and the more and more extensive application of computers in various fields, data mining technology has become a hot research field in todayâ€™s society. Based on the data center, this paper studies the data mining technology. Firstly, this paper expounds the definition of data mining, and studies the process of data mining and the steps of processing data. Then, this paper also designs and studies the framework of data mining, and tests the performance of the algorithm. Finally, the test results show that data mining technology can well meet the target requirements.","authors":["Longjun Zhang","Kun Liu","Ilyar Ilham","Jiaxin Fan"],"meta":["January 2022Journal of Physics Conference Series 2146(1):012017","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/2146/1/012017"],"references":["352690219_Application_of_improved_data-driven_diagnostics_workflow_based_on_coupled_hydro-mechanical_model_for_stimulation_candidate_selection_in_a_complex_carbonate_reservoir","328763371_Study_on_the_biological_basis_of_hypertension_and_syndrome_with_liver-fire_hyperactivity_based_on_data_mining_technology","328632390_Image_Fusion_Based_on_Kernel_Estimation_and_Data_Envelopment_Analysis","324551674_Research_and_Application_of_Video_Encryption_Technology_Based_on_Chaotic_Synchronization_Theory","324522356_Research_on_internet_information_mining_based_on_agent_algorithm","319398510_Research_and_Application_of_Biosensing_Technology_Based_on_Aptamer-Surface_Plasmon_Resonance"]}
