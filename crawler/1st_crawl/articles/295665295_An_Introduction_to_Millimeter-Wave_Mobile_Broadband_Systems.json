{"id":"295665295_An_Introduction_to_Millimeter-Wave_Mobile_Broadband_Systems","abstract":"Almost all mobile communication systems today use spectrum in the range of 300 MHz-3 GHz. In this article, we reason why the wireless community should start looking at the 3-300 GHz spectrum for mobile broadband applications. We discuss propagation and device technology challenges associated with this band as well as its unique advantages for mobile communication. We introduce a millimeter-wave mobile broadband (MMB) system as a candidate next-generation mobile communication system. We demonstrate the feasibility for MMB to achieve gigabit-per-second data rates at a distance up to 1 km in an urban mobile environment. A few key concepts in MMB network architecture such as the MMB base station grid, MMB inter-BS backhaul link, and a hybrid MMB + 4G system are described. We also discuss beamforming techniques and the frame structure of the MMB air interface.","authors":["Zhouyue Pi","Farooq Khan"],"meta":["June 2011IEEE Communications Magazine 49(6):101-107"],"references":["224119281_IEEE_80211ad_Defining_the_Next_Generation_Multi-Gbps_Wi-Fi","234788657_LTE_for_4G_Mobile_Broadband_Air_Interface_Technologies_and_Performance","2982742_Millimeter-wave_CMOS_design"]}
