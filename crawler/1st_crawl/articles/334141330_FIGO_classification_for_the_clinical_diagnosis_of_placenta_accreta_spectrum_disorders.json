{"id":"334141330_FIGO_classification_for_the_clinical_diagnosis_of_placenta_accreta_spectrum_disorders","abstract":"Placenta accreta spectrum is impacting maternal health outcomes globally and its prevalence is likely to increase. Maternal outcomes depend on identification of the condition before or during delivery and, in particular, on the differential diagnosis between its adherent and invasive forms. However, accurate estimation of its prevalence and outcome is currently problematic because of the varying use of clinical criteria to define it at birth and the lack of detailed pathologic examination in most series. Adherence to this new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification should improve future systematic reviews and meta-analyses and provide more accurate epidemiologic data which are essential to develop new management strategies.","authors":["Eric Jauniaux","Diogo Ayres-de-Campos","Jens Langhoff-Roos","Karin A.
