The type of this research was quasi-experiment with two-group pretest and posttest design with the population in this research is all college in Undergraduate Education Physics of State University of Medan in A.Y. 2012/2013 were randomly selected and divided into two classes: the experiment class and the control class. The research instrument was a essay test in higher order thinking with five item. Analysis data would be using ANOVA One ways. The result shown that Student creative thinking in project based learning model is greater than cooperative learning models. It proved learning process with Project Based Learning actually effective to advance Student creative thinking process and observations made by the observer indicated that the student activity positive increased.","authors":["Satria Mihardi","Mara Bangun Harahap","Ridwan Sani"],"meta":["January 2013"],"references":["315633555_Pengaruh_Pembelajaran_Project_Based_Learning_PjBL_pada_Materi_Ekosistem_terhadap_Sikap_dan_Hasil_Belajar_Siswa_SMAN_2_Malang","302947335_Constructionism_learning_by_design_and_project-based_learning","284435161_ICT_in_Physics_Teaching_for_Secondary_Schools_and_Colleges","290531263_The_impact_of_using_KWL_strategy_on_grade_ten_female_students'_reading_comprehension_of_religious_concepts_in_Ma'an_City","275467546_Carmichaels_Manual_of_Child_Psychology","274172043_Technology_integration_applied_to_project-based_learning_in_science","270388286_Creativity_and_Intelligence_Explorations_with_Gifted_Students","268361101_Correlates_of_divergent_thinking_among_secondary_school_physics_students","265238394_The_Effect_of_Project_Based_Learning_and_Student_Engagement_and_Motivation_A_Teacher_Inquiry","260002800_Teaching_And_Learning_Strategies_For_The_Thinking_Classroom"]}
