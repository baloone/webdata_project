{"id":"335229734_Teaching_experience_on_methodological_changes_in_the_dictation_of_the_subject_Fundamentals_of_Computer_Science_for_electrical_and_mechanical_engineering_of_the_UTN-FRBB","abstract":"The present work summarizes an experience carried out within the UTN 4039 PID, where a methodology based on the principles of Evidence-Based Education (EBE) was used to make methodological changes in the subject \"Computer Science Fundamentals\" dictated for students of electrical engineering and mechanics, in the first semester of the first year of both races. The concepts of the Evidence-based Education used were: review of theories applicable to the case, I propose a new methodology for dictating the subject based on cases already verified by the EBE, prior evaluation of the perception on the impact of the new methodology, evaluation of the same perception by the participants in the courses where this methodology was applied, comparative evaluation of instruments used in communication with students and comparative evaluation of the results. The work, rather than showing the results of the exposed case, intends to expose a systemic methodology to objectively evaluate changes and modifications that are desired in the dictation of a subject.","authors":["Alejandro Molina","Elizabeth Oviedo","Fernando Buffone","Victoriano Molinari"],"meta":["August 2019","Project: Graph theory apllied to drones software improvements"],"references":[]}
