{"id":"357057634_Evaluation_of_Information_Technology_Laboratories_Evidence_from_Pakistan","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to examine the evaluation of information technology laboratories established by the government of the Punjab in secondary schools. Information Technology Laboratories (IT labs) were established in the Global Study Services (GSS) of the province of the Punjab for the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Education. The data were gathered using a checklist for headteachers, a questionnaire for teachers, and a questionnaire for students. The findings indicated that 100 % of facilities were provided in IT labs but unfortunately not functioning properly. For example, 61.1% of schools were without internet connection particularly in rural areas, 27.8 % schools without computer science teachers, and 97.2% schools without lab assistants. It was found that the acceptability of computer technology among urban students was high as compared to their rural counterparts. The extent of teaching support to the students was found insufficient. It was recommended that the vacant posts of computer science teacher should be filled and the number of computers in schools should be increased according to the number of students. The findings may contribute to providing a course of action for policymakers, head-teachers, teachers, parents, and students related to computer science education at the secondary school level.","authors":["Uzma Sarwar","Kiran Fazal","Samina Zamir","R Tariq"],"meta":["September 2021","DOI:10.14456/ITJEMAST.2021.245"],"references":["284773069_The_Influence_of_Computer_and_Internet_Use_on_Teachers'_Pedagogical_Practices_and_Perceptions","234695934_Usability_Level_of_Distance_Education_Website_Sakarya_University_Sample","220663410_Qualitative_case_studies_of_innovative_pedagogical_practices_using_ICT","324988337_Organizational_Change_as_Discourse_Communicative_Actions_and_Deep_Structures_in_the_Context_of_Information_Technology_Implementation","259254637_Are_Poor_Countries_Losing_the_Information_Revolution","239427366_Integration_of_ICT_within_a_project-based_learning_environment","237596833_What_can_policy_makers_do_to_encourage_integration_of_information_and_communications_technology_Evidence_from_the_Irish_school_system","226119405_Information_and_Communications_Technology_Integration_and_Developmental_Intervention_Enabling_Knowledge_Creation_and_Capacity_Building_in_Developing_Countries'_Organizations","220175264_Learning_About_Information_Technologies_and_Social_Change_The_Contribution_of_Social_Informatics"]}
