{"id":"326949215_Invited_review_Roles_of_dietary_n-3_fatty_acids_in_performance_milk_fat_composition_and_reproductive_and_immune_systems_in_dairy_cattle","abstract":"Mammals can synthesize all of the fatty acids (FA) necessary for proper health and functioning with the exception of FA in the n-3 (omega-3) and n-6 (omega-6) families of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which should be supplied in the diet. The PUFA are the predominant type of lipid in dairy cattle diets; however, common feedstuffs are rich in n-6 FA, whereas the supply of n-3 FA in the intensive dairy industry is mainly limited to flaxseed and fish oils. The n-3 FA are involved in many biological systems and processes, and therefore their dietary supplementation is of special interest in dairy cattle. Furthermore, because milk, milk products, and meat are among the most important and widely used components in traditional and modern human diets, enrichment of these food products with n-3 FA is of special importance. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive description of different aspects and outcomes involved in dietary n-3 FA supplementation in dairy cattle. I provide an inclusive review of the effects of n-3 FA on milk and milk solids and the FA profile in milk fat upon feeding a variety of flaxseed products or fish oil. Selective uptake of n-3 FA has been demonstrated in the ovary compartments, as well as in bull sperm and in the unborn calf through the placenta. Incorporation of these unique FA into the reproductive system influences many processes and exerts some positive effects on fertility. In addition, beneficial effects of feeding n-3 FA on the reproductive system of females and males can be achieved with supplementation of Î±-linolenic acid from flaxseed or from eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids from fish oil. This work provides a broad perspective and demonstrates the importance and potential of n-3 FA dietary supplementation in dairy cattle on the animal itself, as well as its secondary effects, which are associated with human nutrition and health.","authors":["Uzi Moallem"],"meta":["August 2018Journal of Dairy Science
