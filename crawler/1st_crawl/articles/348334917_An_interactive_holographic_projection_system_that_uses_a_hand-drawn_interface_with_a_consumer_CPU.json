{"id":"348334917_An_interactive_holographic_projection_system_that_uses_a_hand-drawn_interface_with_a_consumer_CPU","abstract":"Holography is a promising technology for photo-realistic three-dimensional (3D) displays because of its ability to replay the light reflected from an object using a spatial light modulator (SLM). However, the enormous computational requirements for calculating computer-generated holograms (CGHs)—which are displayed on an SLM as a diffraction pattern—are a significant problem for practical uses (e.g., for interactive 3D displays for remote navigation systems). Here, we demonstrate an interactive 3D display system using electro-holography that can operate with a consumer’s CPU. The proposed system integrates an efficient and fast CGH computation algorithm for line-drawn 3D objects with inter-frame differencing, so that the trajectory of a line-drawn object that is handwritten on a drawing tablet can be played back interactively using only the CPU. In this system, we used an SLM with 1,920 $$\\times $$ × 1,080 pixels and a pixel pitch of 8 μm × 8 μm, a drawing tablet as an interface, and an Intel Core i9–9900K 3.60 GHz CPU. Numerical and optical experiments using a dataset of handwritten inputs show that the proposed system is capable of reproducing handwritten 3D images in real time with sufficient interactivity and image quality.","authors":["Takashi Nishitsuji","Takashi Kakue","David Blinder","Tomoyoshi Shimobaba"],"meta":["January 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-78902-1"],"references":["334776543_Direct_calculation_of_computer-generated_holograms_in_sparse_bases","333225895_Single_SLM_full-color_holographic_three-dimensional_video_display_based_on_image_and_frequency-shift_multiplexing","322833274_Interactive_Holographic_Display_Based_on_Finger_Gestures","322459256_Accelerated_computer_generated_holography_using_sparse_bases_in_the_STFT_domain","341163446_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_hologram_of_line-drawn_objects_without_FFT","335503021_Real-time_interactive_holographic_3D_display_with_a_360_horizontal_viewing_zone","327948787_Special-purpose_computer_HORN-8_for_phase-type_electro-holography","326387875_Fast_generation_of_full_analytical_polygon-based_computer-generated_holograms","325803005_Accelerated_synthesis_of_wide-viewing_angle_polygon_computer-generated_holograms_using_the_interocular_affine_similarity_of_three-dimensional_scenes","324571600_Decomposition_method_for_fast_computation_of_gigapixel-sized_Fresnel_holograms_on_a_graphics_processing_unit_cluster"]}
