{"id":"245281201_Modelling_and_analysis_of_Canadian_Forces_strategic_lift_and_pre-positioning_options","abstract":"This paper presents analysis of some of the strategic lift and pre-positioning issues within the context of rapid deployability to failed and failing states conducted for the Canadian Forces (CF). A simulation framework was developed to study the effectiveness of a variety of pre-positioning options. An aircraft loading optimization model based on a genetic annealing algorithm with a novel convex hull-based measure of effectiveness was also developed to analyse different strategic lift options. The model was used both to provide insights into the optimal mix of airlift capabilities and to conduct sensitivity analysis. Historical CF deployments provided a baseline performance measure against which several movement solutions were compared and contrasted. Analysis indicates that pre-positioning of equipment and supplies at various strategic locations and use of efficient mix of transport aircraft could be potential strategies for improvement of the CF's strategic lift capability.Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59, 1591â€“1602. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602526 Published online 7 November 2007","authors":["A Ghanmi","R H A D Shaw"],"meta":["December 2008Journal of the Operational Research Society 59(12):1591-1602","DOI:10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602526"],"references":["230669107_Loading_Aircrafts_for_Military_Operations","44707057_TSpack_A_Unified_Tabu_Search_Code_for_Multi-Dimensional_Bin_Packing_Problems","265540263_The_Stryker_Brigade_Combat_Team_Rethinking_Strategic_Responsiveness_and_Assessing_Deployment_Options","244987271_A_Planning_Heuristic_for_Military_Airlift","244957636_A_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm_using_Probabilistic_Selection","242932394_A_Multicriteria_Optimization_Approach_to_Aircraft_Loading","222755644_Some_experiments_with_simulated_annealing_techniques_for_packing_problems","222469675_On_genetic_algorithms_for_the_packing_of_polygons","220669073_Heuristic_and_Metaheuristic_Approaches_for_a_Class_of_Two-Dimensional_Bin_Packing_Problems","220243966_Optimizing_Military_Airlift","4870246_Two-dimensional_packing_problems_A_survey","3933164_Stochastic_modeling_of_airlift_operations","3379130_Population-oriented_simulated_annealing_technique_based_on_local_temperature_concept"]}
