{"id":"316818001_PSS_Pattern_Concept_for_Knowledge_Representation_in_Design_Process_of_Industrial_Product-service_Systems","abstract":"To save time and cost in development process of new customized product-service systems, engineers need methodological guidelines and generic knowledge that help constructing specific solutions for new customersâ€™ requirements and business opportunities. Despite the specific character of every PSS due to several customization issues, many characteristics are shared between PSS from the same product and/or service family. This paper proposes a knowledge-based methodology to support the PSS design process, extending the concepts of pattern and instance as main knowledge fragments. The main idea is to encapsulate in the pattern a conceptual definition of a collection of potential verified solutions, able to achieve a product-service with certain performance value with regard to a set of working conditions. These solutions are then filtered and refined by means of the PSS instance when answering one specific PSS demand.","authors":["Farouk Belkadi","Zhang Yicha","Luis Usatorre","Elaheh Maleki"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia CIRP 60:428-433","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2017.01.001","Projects: ICP4Life (Horizon 2020)ICP4Life"],"references":["301249618_Engineering_models_to_support_product-service_system_integrated_design","281066037_The_Customer_Knowledge_Management_Lifecycle_in_PSS_Value_Networks_Towards_Process_Characterization","274890496_Knowledge_Management_for_Maintenance_Repair_and_Service_of_Manufacturing_System","266799823_A_meta-model_for_knowledge_configuration_management_to_support_collaborative_engineering","264171535_Development_of_integrated_design_methodology_for_various_types_of_product_-_service_systems","303959507_Product_service_systems_ecological_and_economic_basics","293136795_Introduction_to_ProductService-System_Design","285474300_Design_of_competitive_maintenance_service_for_durable_and_capital_goods_using_life_cycle_simulation","273267623_Product-Service_Systems_PSS_business_models_and_tactics_-_A_systematic_literature_review","257552262_A_meta-modelling_framework_for_knowledge_consistency_in_collaborative_design"]}
