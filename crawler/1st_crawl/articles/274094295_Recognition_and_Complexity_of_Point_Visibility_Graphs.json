{"id":"274094295_Recognition_and_Complexity_of_Point_Visibility_Graphs","abstract":"A point visibility graph is a graph induced by a set of points in the plane,\nwhere every vertex corresponds to a point, and two vertices are adjacent\nwhenever the two corresponding points are visible from each other, that is, the\nopen segment between them does not contain any other point of the set. We study\nthe recognition problem for point visibility graphs: given a simple undirected\ngraph, decide whether it is the visibility graph of some point set in the\nplane. We show that the problem is complete for the existential theory of the\nreals. Hence the problem is as hard as deciding the existence of a real\nsolution to a system of polynomial inequalities. The proof involves simple\nsubstructures forcing collinearities in all realizations of some visibility\ngraphs, which are applied to the algebraic universality constructions of Mn\\\"ev\nand Richter-Gebert. This solves a longstanding open question and paves the way\nfor the analysis of other classes of visibility graphs. Furthermore, as a\ncorollary of one of our construction, we show that there exist point visibility\ngraphs that do not admit any geometric realization with points having integer\ncoordinates.","authors":["Jean Cardinal","Udo Hoffmann"],"meta":["January 2017Discrete & Computational Geometry 57(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9831-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267057888_Realizability_of_Graphs_and_Linkages","263545029_Universality_Theorems_for_Inscribed_Polytopes_and_Delaunay_Triangulations","263012338_Point_Visibility_Graph_Recognition_is_NP-Hard","344629444_Oriented_Matroids","316519875_Stretchability_of_pseudolines_is_NP-hard","268609379_Enumerable_sets_are_Diophantine","268313505_Convex_polytopes_Prepared_by_Volker_Kaibel_Victor_Klee_and_Gunter_M_Ziegler_2nd_ed","266532581_Visibility_Algorithms_in_the_Plane","262400273_On_recognizing_and_characterizing_visibility_graphs_of_simple_polygons","259389412_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_And_Applications","243782973_The_Intrinsic_Spread_of_a_Configuration_in_R_d","239811628_On_the_decidability_of_Diophantine_problems_in_combinatorial_geometry","256117628_Some_Results_On_Point_Visibility_Graphs","243590064_Stretchability_of_pseudolines_is_NP-hard","238686688_An_Algorithm_for_Planning_Collision-Free_Paths_Among_Polyhedral_Obstacles"]}
