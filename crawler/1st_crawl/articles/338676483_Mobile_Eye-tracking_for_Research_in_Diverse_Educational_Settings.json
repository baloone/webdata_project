{"id":"338676483_Mobile_Eye-tracking_for_Research_in_Diverse_Educational_Settings","abstract":"Mobile eye-tracking is a technology that captures visual information, such as gaze, eye-movements, and pupil dilations, when learners are mobile. Traditional eye-tracking helps researchers to obtain precise, moment-by-moment information about learnersâ€™ engagement, interactions, and learning processes, but it has some weaknesses due to its structural and stationary nature. Mobile eye-tracking can complement such weaknesses by allowing researchers to collect eye-tracking data when learners move around and interact with multiple targets. This chapter demonstrates how mobile eye-tracking can add more authenticity and nuanced information into Learning Design and Technology research, and then introduces potential research themes that can use mobile eye-tracking. This chapter also overviews the overall processes of applying mobile eye-tracking in a research study and provides an example analysis.","authors":["Yong Ju Jung","Heather Toomey Zimmerman","Koraly Perez-Edgar"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.4324/9780429260919-3","In book: Research Methods in Learning Design and TechnologyPublisher: Routledge","Project: R21 MH111980 Mobile eye-tracking as a tool for studying socioemotional development: Threat-related attention in a social context"],"references":["334278605_Interest_Development_and_Its_Relation_to_Curiosity_Needed_Neuroscientific_Research","326419659_Does_Augmented_Reality_Effectively_Foster_Visual_Learning_Process_in_Construction_An_Eye-Tracking_Study_in_Steel_Installation","313903771_Using_machine_learning_to_detect_events_in_eye-tracking_data","305398827_Problems_With_Different_Interests_of_Learners_in_an_Informal_CSCL_Setting","299545499_Simulated_environments_with_animated_agents_Effects_on_visual_attention_emotion_performance_and_perception","273508228_Where_Low_and_High_Inference_Data_Converge_Validation_of_CLASS_Assessment_of_Mathematics_Instruction_Using_Mobile_Eye_Tracking_with_Expert_and_Novice_Teachers","237107626_In-Sights_into_Mobile_Learning_An_Exploration_of_Mobile_Eye_Tracking_Methodology_for_Learning_in_Museums","235272513_Towards_understanding_engagement_in_games_An_eye-tracking_study","229690039_Situational_Interest_of_High_School_Students_Who_Visit_an_Aquarium","228616958_The_35th_Sir_Frederick_Bartlett_lecture_Eye_movements_and_attention_in_reading_scene_perception_and_visual_search","337992645_Navigating_Through_the_Experienced_Environment_Insights_From_Mobile_Eye_Tracking","333054338_Adaptive_multimedia_Using_gaze-contingent_instructional_guidance_to_provide_personalized_processing_support","331969636_Emerging_and_developing_situational_interest_during_children's_tablet-mediated_biology_learning_activities_at_a_nature_center","331194071_Stationary_and_Ambulatory_Attention_Patterns_are_Differentially_Associated_with_Early_Temperamental_Risk_for_Socioemotional_Problems_Preliminary_Evidence_from_a_Multimodal_Eye-tracking_Investigation","325555411_A_Methodological_Case_Study_with_Mobile_Eye-Tracking_of_Child_Interaction_in_a_Science_Museum","315363551_Learning_Along_Lines_Locative_Literacies_for_Reading_and_Writing_the_City","289962906_The_situativity_of_knowing_learning_and_research","289601600_Comparing_virtual_and_location-based_augmented_reality_mobile_learning_emotions_and_learning_outcomes","265092259_The_Four-Phase_Model_of_Interest_Development","263251503_Situational_Interest_in_Engineering_Design_Activities","262153583_EyeSee3D_a_low-cost_approach_for_analyzing_mobile_3D_eye_tracking_data_using_computer_vision_and_augmented_reality_technology","259189358_An_eye-tracking_study_of_cueing_effects_in_multimedia_learning","259165122_A_review_of_using_eye-tracking_technology_in_exploring_learning_from_2000_to_2012","257813843_Information-seeking_curiosity_and_attention_Computational_and_neural_mechanisms","240427459_The_use_of_eye_movements_in_the_study_of_multimedia_learning","225710784_Research_into_Practice_Current_Trends_in_Educational_Technology_Research_The_Study_of_Learning_Environments","222372772_Eye_tracking_as_a_tool_to_study_and_enhance_multimedia_learning","220810971_Binocular_eye_tracking_in_virtual_reality_for_inspection_training","51738599_Head-Mounted_Eye_Tracking_A_New_Method_to_Describe_Infant_Looking","51516420_To_where_what_and_when_of_gaze_allocation_in_the_lab_and_the_natural_environment","49176543_Situated_Cognition_and_Culture_of_Learning","13438874_Eye_Movements_in_Reading_and_Information_Processing_20_Years_of_Research"]}
