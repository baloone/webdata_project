{"id":"353431999_Bayesian_Estimation_of_Remaining_Useful_Life_for_Wind_Turbine_Blades","abstract":"To optimally plan maintenance of wind turbine blades, knowledge of the degradation processes and the remaining useful life is essential. In this paper, a method is proposed for calibration of a Markov deterioration model based on past inspection data for a range of blades, and updating of the model for a specific wind turbine blade, whenever information is available from inspections and/or condition monitoring. Dynamic Bayesian networks are used to obtain probabilities of inspection outcomes for a maximum likelihood estimation of the transition probabilities in the Markov model, and are used again when updating the model for a specific blade using observations. The method is illustrated using indicative data from a database containing data from inspections of wind turbine blades.","authors":["Jannie Nielsen","John SÃ¸rensen"],"meta":["May 2017Energies 10(5):664","DOI:10.3390/en10050664"],"references":["301934525_Fatigue_damage_diagnostics_and_prognostics_of_composites_utilizing_structural_health_monitoring_data_and_stochastic_processes","299560600_Condition_monitoring_of_wind_turbines_State_of_the_art_user_experience_and_recommendations","286905354_Methods_for_Risk-Based_Planning_of_OM_of_Wind_Turbines","280062707_Vibration-based_SHM_System_Application_to_Wind_Turbine_Blades","314274201_Case_Study_for_Impact_of_D-StringR_on_Levelized_Cost_of_Energy_for_Offshore_Wind_Turbine_Blades","287180824_Bayesian_Networks_and_Decision_Graphs","282807877_Economic_analysis_of_condition_monitoring_systems_for_offshore_wind_turbine_sub-systems","276515541_Thermographic_non-destructive_inspection_of_wind_turbine_blades_using_unmanned_aerial_systems","276459015_In-situ_fatigue_life_prognosis_for_composite_laminates_based_on_stiffness_degradation","272298521_A_review_of_damage_detection_methods_for_wind_turbine_blades"]}
