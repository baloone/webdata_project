{"id":"255702827_Understanding_the_Importance_of_Organizational_Resources_to_Explain_Organizational_Problems_Evidence_from_Nonprofit_Sport_Clubs_in_Germany","abstract":"Nonprofit sport clubs experience organizational problems regarding the\nrecruitment and retention of members, volunteers, and coaches, and the financial\nsituation of the club. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of\ndifferent types of organizational resources on the severity of organizational problems.\nA theoretical framework based on the concept of organizational capacity is\npresented, which explains the influence of human, financial, infrastructure, and\ncultural resources on organizational problems. The empirical evaluation is undertaken\nusing data from a nationwide online survey of nonprofit sport clubs in\nGermany (n = 19,345). The regression results show that human resources (women\non the board, secondary volunteers, etc.), financial resources (Herfindahl index),\ninfrastructure resources (own facilities, and public facilities), and cultural resources\n(e.g., strategic policy, formation policy, value of conviviality, and variety of sports)\nare significant determinants of organizational problems. The findings of this study\nhave implications for the management of voluntary sport organizations.","authors":["Pamela Wicker","Christoph Breuer"],"meta":["June 2012International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations 24(2):461-484","DOI:10.1007/s11266-012-9272-2","Project: Economics and sociology of non-profit sports clubs"],"references":["287456018_A_System_Resource_Approach_to_Organizational_Effectiveness","350682693_Multiple_Regression_and_Beyond","324995251_Board_Power_and_Organizational_Effectiveness_Among_Human_Service_Agencies","312387719_The_Strategic_Analysis_of_Intangible_Resources","303057645_The_resource-based_view_of_the_firm_Ten_years_after","292295549_Resource_composition_and_oligarchization_Evidence_from_german_sport_clubs","292294361_The_Politics_of_Sport_Clubs_Positioning_Your_Program_in_an_Era_of_Dwindling_Resources","288184917_Multidimensionality_and_Multiple_Perspectives_of_Organizational_Effectiveness","285875586_Firm_Resources_and_Sustained_Competitive_Advantage","284041695_Self-Report_in_Organisational_Research_Problems_and_Prospects"]}
