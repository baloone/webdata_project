More precisely, we explore the role of upper echelon and employee human capital and human resources management as determinants of innovation. Our approach builds on a 'human resource'-based view, stressing the importance of (1) entrepreneur/entrepreneurial team ('upper echelon') human resources and (2) employee human resources and their management in determining the innovation performance of start-ups. As innovation is one of the three possible outcomes of corporate entrepreneurship (innovation, venturing and renewal), we take a corporate entrepreneurship research approach in examining innovation in start-ups. The analyses are based on a sample of 294 start-ups covering a wide range of economic activities, having 1 to 49 employees and being in their second year of life in 2003. The results indicate that both types of human capital do matter in the context of start-up innovation. First of all, employee human capital and HRM have a strong positive effect on innovation. Second, while we could not trace direct effects of entrepreneur/entrepreneurial team human capital on innovation, indirect effects (via HRM or employee human capital) of for instance education level and business advice are indisputably present. All things considered, the study teaches us that valuing human capital in start-ups can contribute to a considerable extent to preserving their innovation performance, thus stimulating their chances of building a viable business model and safeguarding future growth and further development.","authors":["Jerome A.
