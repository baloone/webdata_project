{"id":"341088952_A_MicroRNA_Signature_in_Acute_Coronary_Syndrome_Patients_and_Modulation_by_Colchicine","abstract":"Background\nCirculating microRNAs (miRNAs) may play a pathogenic role in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). It is not yet known if miRNAs dysregulated in ACS are modulated by colchicine. We profiled miRNAs in plasma samples simultaneously collected from the aorta, coronary sinus, and right atrium in patients with ACS.\n\nMethods\nA total of 396 of 754 miRNAs were detected by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction from EDTA-plasma in a discovery cohort of 15 patients (n = 3 controls, n = 6 ACS standard therapy, n = 6 ACS standard therapy plus colchicine). Fifty-one significantly different miRNAs were then measured in a verification cohort of 92 patients (n = 13 controls, n = 40 ACS standard therapy, n = 39 ACS standard therapy plus colchicine). Samples were simultaneously obtained from the coronary sinus, aortic root, and right atrium.\n\nResults\nCirculating levels of 30 of 51 measured miRNAs were higher in ACS standard therapy patients compared to controls. In patients with ACS, levels of 12 miRNAs (miR-17, -106b-3p, -191, -106a, -146a, -130a, -223, -484, -889, -425-3p, -629, -142-5p) were lower with colchicine treatment. Levels of 7 of these 12 miRNA were higher in ACS standard therapy patients compared to controls and returned to levels seen in control individuals after colchicine treatment. Three miRNAs suppressed by colchicine (miR-146a, miR-17, miR-130a) were identified as regulators of inflammatory pathways. MicroRNAs were comparable across sampling sites with select differences in the transcoronary gradient of 4 miRNA.\n\nConclusion\nThe levels of specific miRNAs elevated in ACS returned to levels similar to control individuals following colchicine. These miRNAs may mediate ACS (via inflammatory pathways) or increase post-ACS risk, and could be potentially used as biomarkers of treatment efficacy.","authors":["Jennifer Y.
