{"id":"257196625_Parallel_machine_scheduling_with_additional_resources_Notation_classification_models_and_solution_methods","abstract":"Majority of parallel machine scheduling studies consider machine as the only resource. However, in most real-life manufacturing environments, jobs may require additional resources, such as automated guided vehicles, machine operators, tools, pallets, dies, and industrial robots, for their handling and processing. This paper presents a review and discussion of studies on the parallel machine scheduling problems with additional resources. Papers are surveyed in five main categories: machine environment, additional resource, objective functions, complexity results and solution methods, and other important issues. The strengths and weaknesses of the literature together with open areas for future studies are also emphasized. Finally, extensions of integer programming models for two main classes of related problems are given and conclusions are drawn based on computational studies.","authors":["Emrah Edis","Ceyda
