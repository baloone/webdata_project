{"id":"265362712_Loop-free_sequencing_of_bounded_integer_compositions","abstract":"We modify the Knuth-Klingsberg Gray code for unrestricted integer compositions to obtain a Gray code for integer compositions each of whose parts is bounded between zero and some positive integer. We also generalize Ehrlich’s method for loop-free sequencing to implement this Gray code in O(1) worst-case time per composition. The (n-1)-part compositions of r whose ith part is bounded by n-i are the inversion vectors of the permutations of {1,⋯,n} with r inversions; we thus obtain a Gray code and a loop-free sequencing algorithm for this set of permutations.","authors":["Timothy Robert Walsh"],"meta":["January 2000Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing 33"],"references":["284745535_Sure_le_developpement_du_produit_infini_1-x1-x21-x3","265938404_A_GENERAL_METHOD_FOR_DETERMINING_A_CLOSED_FORMULA_FOR_THE_NUMBER_OF_PARTITIONS_OF_THE_INTEGER_n_INTO_m_POSITIVE_INTEGERS_FOR_SMALL_VALUES_OF_m","242512892_A_New_Measure_of_Rank_Correlation","239065796_Combinatorial_Algorithms_An_Update","238876388_Two_Applications_of_General_Theorems_in_Combinatory_Analysis_1_To_the_Theory_of_Inversions_of_Permutations_2_To_the_Ascertainment_of_the_Numbers_of_Terms_in_the_Development_of_a_Determinant_which_has_","238126334_Combination_generation_and_graylex_ordering","235127121_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","220430697_Loopless_Algorithms_for_Generating_Permutations_Combinations_and_Other_Combinatorial_Configurations","220423356_Enumerating_Combinations_of_m_Out_of_n_Objects_G6_Algorithm_452","220406820_A_Gray_Code_for_Compositions"]}
