{"id":"222705239_More_restrictive_Gray_codes_for_necklaces_and_Lyndon_words","abstract":"In the last years, the order induced by the Binary Reflected Gray Code or its generalizations shown an increasing interest. In this note we show that the BRGC order induces a cyclic 2-Gray code on the set of binary necklaces and Lyndon words and a cyclic 3-Gray code on the unordered counterparts. This is an improvement and a generalization to unlabeled words of the result in [V. Vajnovszki, Gray code order for Lyndon words, Discrete Math. Theoret. Comput. Sci. 9 (2) (2007) 145â€“152; M. Weston, V. Vajnovszki, Gray codes for necklaces and Lyndon words of arbitrary base, Pure Mathematics and Applications/Algebra and Theoretical Computer Science, in press]; however an algorithmic implementation of our Gray codes remains an open problem.","authors":["Vincent Vajnovszki"],"meta":["April 2008Information Processing Letters 106(3):96-99","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2007.10.011","SourceDBLP"],"references":["222684735_Minimal_change_list_for_Lucas_Strings_and_some_graph_theoritic_consequences","221426966_Generating_Necklaces_and_Strings_with_Forbidden_Substrings","220909324_Generating_Gray_Codes_in_O1_Worst-Case_Time_per_Word","220780020_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Generating_Necklaces_with_Fixed_Density","2565700_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Generating_Necklaces_with_Fixed_Density_Joe_Sawada","242401572_Gray_codes_for_necklaces_and_Lyndon_words_of_arbitrary_base","237005299_Combinatorial_Generation","220533569_A_Gray_Code_for_Necklaces_of_Fixed_Density","220407167_Fast_Algorithms_to_Generate_Necklaces_Unlabeled_Necklaces_and_Irreducible_Polynomials_over_GF2","220406711_Generating_Necklaces","220342652_Gray-ordered_Binary_Necklaces","220193996_On_binary_reflected_Gray_codes_and_functions","220185309_Gray_codes_for_necklaces","37441589_Pulse_communication","26645304_Gray_Code_Order_for_Lyndon_Words"]}
