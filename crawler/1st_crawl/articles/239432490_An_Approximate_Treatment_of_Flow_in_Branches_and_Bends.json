{"id":"239432490_An_Approximate_Treatment_of_Flow_in_Branches_and_Bends","abstract":"Flow in channel branches and bends is analysed by using elementary hydraulic theory. The results are expressions for the local loss coefficients. The primary purpose is to explore the simplified flow processes in the two flow elements. The theoretical solutions match observations well qualitatively but need improvement if quantitative agreement with observations is to be obtained.","authors":["Willi H.
