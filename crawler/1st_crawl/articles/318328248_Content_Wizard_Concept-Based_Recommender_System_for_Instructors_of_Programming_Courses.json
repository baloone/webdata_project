{"id":"318328248_Content_Wizard_Concept-Based_Recommender_System_for_Instructors_of_Programming_Courses","abstract":"Authoring an adaptive educational system is a complex process that involves allocating a large range of educational content within a fixed sequence of units. In this paper, we describe Content Wizard, a concept-based recommender system for recommending learning materials that meet the instructor's pedagogical goals during the creation of an online programming course. Here, the instructors are asked to provide a set of code examples that jointly reflect the learning goals that are associated with each course unit. The Wizard is built on top of our course-authoring tool, and it helps to decrease the time instructors spend on the task and to maintain the coherence of the sequential structure of the course. It also provides instructors with additional information to identify content that might be not appropriate for the unit they are creating. We conducted an off-line study with data collected from an introductory Java course previously taught at the University of Pittsburgh in order to evaluate both the practicality and effectiveness of the system. We found that the proposed recommendation's performance is relatively close to the teacher's expectation in creating a computer-based adaptive course.","authors":["Hung Chau","Jordan Barria-Pineda","Peter Brusilovsky"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1145/3099023.3099039","Conference: Adjunct Publication of the 25th Conference","Project: Infrastructure for Computer Science Education"],"references":["292996357_An_Intelligent_Interface_for_Learning_Content_Combining_an_Open_Learner_Model_and_Social_Comparison_to_Support_Self-Regulated_Learning_and_Engagement","283281344_What_Should_I_Do_Next_Adaptive_Sequencing_in_the_Context_of_Open_Social_Student_Modeling","278644904_Challenges_to_Enhancing_Authoring_Tools_and_Methods_for_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","259781445_JavaParser_A_Fine-Grain_Concept_Indexing_Tool_for_Java_Problems","229674759_Guiding_students_to_the_right_questions_Adaptive_navigation_support_in_an_E-Learning_system_for_Java_programming","221413662_The_Cognitive_Tutor_Authoring_Tools_CTAT_Preliminary_Evaluation_of_Efficiency_Gains","321606866_Authoring_Tools_for_Advanced_Technology_Learning_Environments_Toward_Cost-Effective_Adaptive_Interactive_and_Intelligent_Educational_Software","300790117_Situated_Pedagogical_Authoring_Authoring_Intelligent_Tutors_from_a_Student's_Perspective","234831795_Eighteen_Pascal_texts_An_objective_comparison","228328548_An_Overview_of_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_Authoring_Tools_Updated_Analysis_of_the_State_of_the_Art"]}
