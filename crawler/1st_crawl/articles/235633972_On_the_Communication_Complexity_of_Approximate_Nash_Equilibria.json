{"id":"235633972_On_the_Communication_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","abstract":"We study the problem of computing approximate Nash equilibria of bimatrix\ngames, in a setting where players initially know their own payoffs but not the\npayoffs of the other player. In order for a solution of reasonable quality to\nbe found, some amount of communication needs to take place between the players.\nWe are interested in algorithms where the communication is substantially less\nthan the contents of a payoff matrix, for example logarithmic in the size of\nthe matrix. When the communication is polylogarithmic in the number of\nstrategies n, we show how to obtain epsilon-approximate Nash equilibria for\nepsilon approximately 0.438, and for well-supported approximate equilibria we\nobtain epsilon approximately 0.732. For one-way communication we show that\nepsilon=1/2 is achievable, but no constant improvement over 1/2 is possible,\neven with unlimited one-way communication. For well-supported equilibria, no\nvalue of epsilon less than 1 is achievable with one-way communication. When the\nplayers do not communicate at all, epsilon-Nash equilibria can be obtained for\nepsilon=3/4, and we also give a lower bound of slightly more than 1/2 on the\nlowest constant epsilon achievable.","authors":["Paul Goldberg","Arnoud Pastink"],"meta":["February 2013Games and Economic Behavior 85(1)","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-33996-7_17","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235509448_Learning_Equilibria_of_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","325584533_Linear_Programming_and_Extensions","314908663_Stochastic_Uncoupled_Dynamics_and_Nash_Equilibrium","279553677_Some_Discriminant-Based_PAC_Algorithms","274238501_Linear_Programming_and_Extensions","243134336_Settling_the_Complexity_of_2Player_Nash-Equilibrium","241850339_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","228108257_Non-Cooperative_Games","228108244_Zur_Theorie_der_Gesellschaftspiele"]}
