{"id":"243659375_A_Polynomial_Algorithm_for_the_k-cut_Problem_for_Fixed_k","abstract":"The k-cut problem is to find a partition of an edge weighted graph into k nonempty components, such that the total edge weight between components is minimum. This problem is NP-complete for an arbitrary k and its version involving fixing a vertex in each component is NP-hard even for k = 3. We present a polynomial algorithm for k fixed, that runs in Onki¾²/2-3k/2+4Tn, m steps, where Tn, m is the running time required to find the minimum s, t-cut on a graph with n vertices and m edges.","authors":["Olivier Goldschmidt","Dorit S.
