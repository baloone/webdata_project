{"id":"3572206_Integrator_backstepping_techniques_for_the_tracking_control_ofpermanent_magnet_brush_DC_motors","abstract":"A series of motor control experiments is described. The results are based on a nonlinear design technique called integrator backstepping. This model-based approach is applied to the design and implementation of high-performance trajectory tracking controllers for a BDC (brush DC) motor driving a single-link robot. Two controllers are proposed: an embedded computed torque controller which requires full-state feedback and an output feedback controller which only requires position measurement (i.e., observed backstepping). Both controllers require exact knowledge of the electromechanical dynamics in order to guarantee GES tracking performance. Extensions of the proposed backstepping techniques are discussed for more complex electromechanical systems, and for systems with uncertainty. The proposed controllers are simulated and implemented on a state-of-the-art DSP (digital signal processing) based workstation using a user-developed real-time DAC (data acquisition and control) system","authors":["J.J.
