{"id":"309744453_Mandibular_position_and_movements_Suitability_for_diagnosis_of_sleep_apnoea_Sleep_mandibular_movements","abstract":"Background and objective: \nMandibular movements (MMs) and position during sleep reflect respiratory efforts related to increases in upper airway resistance and micro-arousals. The study objective was to assess whether MM identifies sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in patients with moderate to high pre-test probability.\n\nMethods: \nThis was a prospective study of 87 consecutive patients referred for an in-laboratory sleep test. Magnetometer-derived MM signals were incorporated into standard polysomnography (PSG). Respiratory events detected with MM analysis were compared with PSG for respiratory disturbance index (RDI) with a blinded scoring. All records were scored manually according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine rules. Primary outcome was to rule-in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) defined as RDI cut-off value ≥5 or 15/h total sleep time (TST).\n\nResults: \nHigh concordance emerged between MM and PSG-derived RDI with high temporal coincidence between events (R(2) = 0.906; P < 0.001). The mean diagnostic accuracy of MM for OSAS using RDI MM cut-off values of 5.9 and 13.5 was 0.935 (0.86-0.97) and 0.913 (0.84-0.95), with a mean positive likelihood ratio (LLR+) of 3.73 (2.7-20.4) and 8.46 (2.3-31.5), respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves at PSG cut-off values of 5 and 15/h TST had areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.89-0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) (P < 0.001), respectively. MM analysis accurately identified SDB at different levels of severity.\n\nConclusion: \nRDI assessed by MM is highly concordant with PSG, suggesting a role of ambulatory MM recordings to screen for SDB in patients with moderate to high pre-test probability.","authors":["J.-B.
