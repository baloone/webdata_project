{"id":"329369512_Simultaneous_temperature_sensing_using_distributed_cascading_fiber_Bragg_grating-based_single-ended_Brillouin_optical_time-domain_analyzer","abstract":"We report a novel method of simultaneous distributed temperature sensing in optical fibers. The method is based on the cascading fiber Bragg grating (FBG) single-ended Brillouin optical time-domain analyzer (BOTDA). This proposal applies the technology of cascading FBGs to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the single-ended BOTDA. Experimental results show achievement of a 50 km sensing range with 3 Â°C temperature resolution and 5 m spatial resolution.","authors":["Jin Xu","Zbigniew Dziong","Adnane Cabani"],"meta":["December 2018Laser Physics 28(12):125101","DOI:10.1088/1555-6611/aae066"],"references":["316429207_Analytical_expression_and_experimental_validation_of_the_Brillouin_gain_spectral_broadening_at_any_sensing_spatial_resolution","313793695_Ultrahigh-speed_distributed_Brillouin_reflectometry","302064642_Going_beyond_1000000_resolved_points_in_a_Brillouin_distributed_fiber_sensor_Theoretical_analysis_and_experimental_demonstration","260153678_Linearly_configured_BOCDA_system_using_a_differential_measurement_scheme","315176029_Theoretical_evaluation_of_Brillouin_dynamic_grating_length_localized_by_optical_correlation_domain_technique_through_reflection_spectrum_simulation","312872246_Slope-assisted_BOTDA_based_on_vector_SBS_and_frequency-agile_technique_for_wide-strain-range_dynamic_measurements","284903298_Brillouin_optical-fiber_time_domain_reflectometry","260720052_Distributed_Temperature_Sensing_in_Polymer_Optical_Fiber_by_BOFDA","260359540_1-cm-Spatial-Resolution_Brillouin_Optical_Time-Domain_Analysis_Based_on_Bright_Pulse_Brillouin_Gain_and_Complementary_Code","260328052_Improvement_of_Spatial_Resolution_for_BOTDR_by_Iterative_Subdivision_Method"]}
