{"id":"320299262_How_to_Efficiently_Build_a_Front-End_Tool_for_UPPAAL_A_Model-Driven_Approach","abstract":"We propose a model-driven engineering approach that facilitates the production of tool chains that use the popular model checker Uppaal as a back-end analysis tool. In this approach, we introduce a metamodel for Uppaal's input model, containing both timed-automata concepts and syntax-related elements for C-like expressions. We also introduce a metamodel for Uppaal's query language to specify temporal properties; as well as a metamodel for traces to interpret Uppaal's counterexamples and witnesses. The approach provides a systematic way to build software bridging tools (i.e., tools that translate from a domain-specific language to Uppaal's input language) such that these tools become easier to debug, extend, reuse and maintain. We demonstrate our approach on five different domains: cyber-physical systems, hardware-software co-design, cyber-security, reliability engineering and software timing analysis.","authors":["Stefano Schivo","Buğra Kaan Yıldız","Enno Ruijters","Christopher Gerking"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-69483-2_19","Conference: Symposium on Dependable Software EngineeringAt: Changsa, China","Projects: ArRangeerTechnology-supported Risk Estimation by Predictive Assessment of Socio-technical Security"],"references":["315135384_A_Model-Derivation_Framework_for_Software_Analysis","312344432_A_Model-Driven_Framework_for_Hardware-Software_Co-design_of_Dataflow_Applications","311426399_Quantitative_Security_and_Safety_Analysis_with_Attack-Fault_Trees","305671137_Modelling_with_ANIMO_Between_fuzzy_logic_and_differential_equations","321618610_Model-Based_Design_of_Adaptive_Embedded_Systems","318873841_An_MDE_Approach_for_Modular_Program_Analyses","313218002_Timed_automata_Semantics_algorithms_and_tools","308990016_Complementing_testing_of_IEC61499_function_blocks_with_model-checking","301574650_Fault_maintenance_trees_Reliability_centered_maintenance_via_statistical_model_checking","300858418_The_Modest_Toolset_An_Integrated_Environment_for_Quantitative_Modelling_and_Verification","295868428_Domain-Specific_Model_Checking_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems","295868182_Domain-specific_Model_Checking_of_MechatronicUML_Models_Using_Uppaal","283815375_Quantitative_Attack_Tree_Analysis_via_Priced_Timed_Automata","278851131_Model-driven_engineering_A_survey_supported_by_A_unified_conceptual_model","293276623_ANIMO_a_tool_for_modeling_biological_pathway_dynamics"]}
