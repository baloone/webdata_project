{"id":"334275114_Can_Currency_Competition_Work","abstract":"Can competition among privately-issued fiat currencies work? Only sometimes and partially. To show this, we build a model of competition among privately-issued fiat currencies. A purely private arrangement fails to implement an efficient allocation, even though it can deliver price stability under certain technological conditions. Although currency competition creates problems for monetary policy, it is possible to design a policy rule that uniquely implements an efficient allocation.","authors":["Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde","Daniel Sanches"],"meta":["July 2019Journal of Monetary Economics 106(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.07.003"],"references":["304046078_Monetary_policy_with_asset-backed_money","24108267_Speculative_Hyperinflations_in_Maximizing_Models_Can_We_Rule_Them_Out","315907384_Banks_as_Secret_Keepers","270419477_The_Optimum_Quantity_of_Money","222914363_Bargaining_and_the_Value_of_Money","222571582_Endogenous_supply_of_fiat_money","222547562_Dynamics_Cycles_and_Sunspot_Equilibria_in_'Genuinely_Dynamic_Fundamentally_Disaggregative'_Models_of_Money","222468744_Has_Government_Any_Role_in_Money","222430782_Currency_Competition_A_Partial_Vindication_of_Hayek","222149802_On_the_Private_Provision_of_Fiat_Currency","24104095_Private_Money_and_Reserve_Management_in_a_Random-Matching_Model","24092750_The_Indeterminacy_of_Equilibrium_Exchange_Rates","5168850_The_Competitive_Supply_of_Money","5168067_Private_Money","5168064_Inside_Money_as_Alternative_Media_of_Exchange","5110653_Private_versus_Public_Money","5110593_Liquidity_Money_Creation_and_Destruction_and_the_Returns_to_Banking","5110392_Whither_Monetary_Economics","4722573_How_Would_the_Invisble_Hand_Handle_Money"]}
