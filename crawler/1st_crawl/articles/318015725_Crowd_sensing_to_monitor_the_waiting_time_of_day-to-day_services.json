{"id":"318015725_Crowd_sensing_to_monitor_the_waiting_time_of_day-to-day_services","abstract":"This work proposes the use of vivid impressions of users to monitor the waiting and service time in the\nprovision of public and private services. The solution consists of an environment in which users can report the\ntime spent waiting for the provision of a particular service. The waiting time for customer services is a problem\nthat affects most cultures and has been studied by the academic community for several decades from the\nstandpoint of psychology, sociology, marketing and computer science. In this paper we present a review of the\nliterature on the subject, and also propose a classification of approaches that deal with this problem. We also\nreport our participatory effort in articulating requirements and functionalities of a design solution to address this\nproblem. A series of interviews were conducted with stakeholders and other people involved in the problem of\nwaiting time delays in customer services, allowing requirements to be posed and validated through a survey.\nFinally, we present the latest details of an application being developed to address this problem and the final\nconclusions.","authors":["Luiz Oliveira","Daniel Schneider","Jano Moreira De Souza","Sergio Assis Rodrigues"],"meta":["January 2017","Project: Sherlock"],"references":["316213819_Towards_an_observatory_for_mobile_participatory_sensing_applications","316213620_Towards_a_Framework_for_Supporting_Community_Modeling_in_Crowdsourcing_Systems","314476287_Designing_building_and_evaluating_a_social_news_curation_environment_using_the_action_design_research_methodology","300720898_QueueVadis_queuing_analytics_using_smartphones","282672078_Crowdsourcing_Queue_Estimations_in_Situ","277974252_Crowd-Sourced_Mobility_Mapping_for_Location_Tracking_Using_Unlabeled_Wi-Fi_Simultaneous_Localization_and_Mapping","314919447_Leveraging_the_crowd_collaboration_to_monitor_the_waiting_time_of_day-to-day_services","308188016_Designing_for_monitoring_the_waiting_time_of_day-to-day_services","287918409_LineKing_Crowdsourced_Line_Wait-Time_Estimation_Using_Smartphones","286668581_QueueSense_Collaborative_recognition_of_queuing_on_mobile_phones"]}
