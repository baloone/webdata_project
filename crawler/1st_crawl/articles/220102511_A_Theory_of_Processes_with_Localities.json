{"id":"220102511_A_Theory_of_Processes_with_Localities","abstract":"We study a notion of observation for concurrent processes which allows the observer to see the distributed nature of processes, giving explicit names for the location of actions. A general notion of bisimulation related to this observation of distributed systems is introduced. Our main result is that these bisimulation relations, particularized to a process algebra extending CCS, are completely axiomatizable. We discuss in detail two instances of location bisimulations, namely the location equivalence and the location preorder.","authors":["GÃ©rard Boudol","Ilaria Castellani","Matthew Hennessy","Astrid Kiehn"],"meta":["March 1994Formal Aspects of Computing 6(2):165-200","DOI:10.1007/BF01221098","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220102491_A_Static_View_of_Localities","43611028_Distributed_bisimulations","43406834_Observing_localities","319541746_Bisimulations_for_concurrency","245624208_CCS-A_Calculus_for_Communicating_Systems","239065331_Observational_Equivalences_for_Concurrency_Models","224001269_Communication_and_Concurrency","222758282_Observing_localities","222436931_Algebra_of_communicating_processes_with_abstraction","221256715_Causal_Trees_Interleaving_Causality","221256703_Equivalences_and_Refinement","220896999_A_Parametric_Approach_to_Localities","220700866_A_Theory_of_Process_with_Localities_Extended_Abstract","220688100_A_Calculus_of_Communicating_System","220617466_Axiomatising_Finite_Concurrent_Processes","220431372_Flowgraphs_and_Flow_Algebras","220430894_Algebraic_Laws_for_Nondeterminism_and_Concurrency"]}
