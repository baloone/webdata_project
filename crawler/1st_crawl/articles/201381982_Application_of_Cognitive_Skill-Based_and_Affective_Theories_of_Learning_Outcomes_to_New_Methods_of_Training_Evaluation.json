{"id":"201381982_Application_of_Cognitive_Skill-Based_and_Affective_Theories_of_Learning_Outcomes_to_New_Methods_of_Training_Evaluation","abstract":"Although training evaluation is recognized as an important component of the instructional design model, there are no theoretically based models of training evaluation. This article attempts to move toward such a model by developing a classification scheme for evaluating learning outcomes. Learning constructs are derived from a variety of research domains, such as cognitive, social, and instructional psychology and human factors. Drawing from this research, the authors propose cognitive, skill-based, and affective learning outcomes (relevant to training) and recommend potential evaluation measures. The learning outcomes and associated evaluation measures are organized into a classification scheme. Requirements for providing construct-oriented evidence of validity for the scheme are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)","authors":["Kurt Kraiger","J.
