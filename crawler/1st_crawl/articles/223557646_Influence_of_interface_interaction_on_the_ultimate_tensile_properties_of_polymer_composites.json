{"id":"223557646_Influence_of_interface_interaction_on_the_ultimate_tensile_properties_of_polymer_composites","abstract":"Tensile strength of a polymer composite is determined by several factors including the decrease of specimen cross-section during elongation, decrease of the effective load-bearing cross-section as an effect of filling, increase of strength due to the orientation of the matrix (strain hardening) and polymer/matrix interaction. This latter, in itself, is influenced by several factors, e.g., size of the interface, strength of the interaction, filler anisotropy and orientation, aggregation. In the paper a model is proposed, which quantitatively takes into account the above effects. The ultimate tensile properties of different particulate and short fibre filled thermoplastic composites are analysed using the proposed model equation. It is shown that the size of the interface and the strength of the interaction significantly influence both of these characteristics. The effect of polymer type, filler anisotropy and aggregation is also studied. The question of ductile and brittle failure and the limitations of the model are discussed, as well.","authors":["Bela Pukanszky"],"meta":["May 1990Composites 21(3):255-262","DOI:10.1016/0010-4361(90)90240-W"],"references":["321546695_Molecular_Characterization_of_Composite_Interfaces","284324270_Some_aspects_of_the_autoadhesion_of_elastomers","279655598_CHARACTERIZATION_OF_DISPERSION_IN_MINERAL-FILLED_THERMOPLASTICS_COMPOUNDS","273009346_Looking_at_Rubber_Adhesion","248365867_On_the_tensile_behaviour_of_filled_composites","246797295_The_Mechanical_Properties_of_Solid_Polymers","243840118_Mica_as_filler_for_PVC_compounds_Effects_of_particle_size_and_surface_treatment","230410451_Rheology_and_tensile_properties_of_polypropylene_reinforced_with_glycerol-treated_mica","230407554_Mica_reinforced_polypropylene","230384430_Dynamic_Mechanical_Behaviour_of_Filled_Polyethylens_and_Model_Composites","230142605_Measurement_of_fiber_and_matrix_orientations_in_fiber_reinforced_composites","230116558_The_Strength_of_Polymeric_Composites_Containing_Spherical_Fillers","229872462_Effects_of_coupling_agents_on_the_rheological_properties_processability_and_mechanical_properties_of_filled_polypropylene","229756538_Stress-strain_behavior_of_styrene-acrylonitrileglass_bead_composites_in_the_glassy_region","229736130_Mechanical_properties_of_particulate_composites","229708942_Properties_of_a_particulate-filled_polymer","229659596_The_properties_of_mica-filled_polypropylenes","229584391_Effects_of_coupling_agents_on_the_mechanical_and_rheologica_properties_and_mica-reinforced_polypropylene","225926596_Composition_dependence_of_tensile_yield_stress_in_filled_polymers"]}
