{"id":"266343611_Viscosity_method_for_hierarchical_fixed_point_approach_to_variational_inequalities","abstract":"A viscosity method for a hierarchical fixed point approach to variational inequality problems is presented. This method is used to solve variational inequalities where the involving operators are complements of nonexpansive mappigs and the solutions are sought in the set of the fixed points of another nonexpansive mapping. Such variational inequalities include monotone inclusions and convex optimization problems to be solved over the fixed point sets of nonexpansive mappings.","authors":["Hong Xu"],"meta":["April 2010Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics 14(2)","DOI:10.11650/twjm/1500405802"],"references":["255701861_Strong_convergence_of_an_iterative_method_for_hierarchical_fixed-point_problems","265959639_Some_questions_in_metric_fixed_point_theory","265887151_Strong_weak_convergence_theorems_of_implicit_hybrid_steepest-descent_methods_for_variational_inequalities","265620307_A_proximal_method_for_pseudomonotone_type_variational-like_inequalities","265369089_Remarks_on_an_iterative_method_for_nonexpansive_mappings","265369011_Approximating_fixed_points_of_nonexpansive_mappings","265357632_Auxiliary_problem_method_for_mixed_variational-like_inequalities","246200797_Fixed_points_of_nonexpanding","245041467_A_hybrid_extragradient_method_for_general_variational_inequalities","243675358_Variational_Convergence_for_Functions_and_Operators"]}
