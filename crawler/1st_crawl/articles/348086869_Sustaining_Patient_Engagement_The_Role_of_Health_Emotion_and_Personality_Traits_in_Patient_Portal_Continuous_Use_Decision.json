{"id":"348086869_Sustaining_Patient_Engagement_The_Role_of_Health_Emotion_and_Personality_Traits_in_Patient_Portal_Continuous_Use_Decision","abstract":"Healthcare providers increasingly rely on technology, such as patient portals, for asynchronous communication with their patients. Even though clinicians have increasingly adopted patient portals to enhance healthcare quality and reduce cost, few patients continue to use this technology. In this paper, we investigate the effect that individuals’ health emotion and personality traits as measured using the five-factor model (FFM) have on patients’ intention to continually use patient portals through the lens of emotional dissonance theory. We collected survey data from 187 patients at a major medical center in the Midwestern United States. After we analyzed the data using structural equation modeling, we found that the final model explained 40 percent of the variance in intention to continue to use. Our results suggest that whether individuals continue to use technology depends on their reactions to technology in which health emotions and personality traits play a crucial part. Additionally, health emotion modifies the effect that personality traits have on patients’ intention to continue to use a patient portal. Our study provides healthcare organizations with an integrated view of patient portal use behavior and shows that individual personality traits and health emotion may increase sustainable patient enrollment and engagement.","authors":["Murad Moqbel","Mohammed Sajedur Rahman","Sunyoung Cho","Barbara Hewitt"],"meta":["December
