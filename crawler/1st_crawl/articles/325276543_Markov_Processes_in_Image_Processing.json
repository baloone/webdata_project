{"id":"325276543_Markov_Processes_in_Image_Processing","abstract":"Digital images are used as an information carrier in different sciences and technologies. The aspiration to increase the number of bits in the image pixels for the purpose of obtaining more information is observed. In the paper, some methods of compression and contour detection on the basis of two-dimensional Markov chain are offered. Increasing the number of bits on the image pixels will allow one to allocate fine object details more precisely, but it significantly complicates image processing. The methods of image processing do not concede by the efficiency to well-known analogues, but surpass them in processing speed. An image is separated into binary images, and processing is carried out in parallel with each without an increase in speed, when increasing the number of bits on the image pixels. One more advantage of methods is the low consumption of energy resources. Only logical procedures are used and there are no computing operations. The methods can be useful in processing images of any class and assignment in processing systems with a limited time and energy resources.","authors":["E P Petrov","N L Kharina"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 1015(3):032059","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1015/3/032059"],"references":["311718199_The_Problems_of_Remote_Sensing_of_Earth_Surface","272187620_Block-Based_Spatial_Prediction_and_Transforms_Based_on_2D_Markov_Processes_for_Image_and_Video_Compression","237070911_DCTDST-Based_Transform_Coding_for_Intra_Prediction_in_ImageVideo_Coding","230771096_Digital_Image_Processing"]}
