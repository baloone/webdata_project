{"id":"270411119_Port-Hamiltonian_Systems_Theory_An_Introductory_Overview","abstract":"An up-to-date survey of the theory of port-Hamiltonian systems is given, emphasizing novel developments and relationships with other formalisms. Port-Hamiltonian systems theory yields a systematic framework for network modeling of multi-physics systems. Examples from different areas show the range of applicability. While the emphasis is on modeling and analysis, the last part provides a brief introduction to control of port-Hamiltonian systems.","authors":["Arjan van der Schaft","Dimitri Jeltsema"],"meta":["January 2014Foundations and TrendsÂ® in Systems and Control 1(2):173-378","DOI:10.1561/2600000002"],"references":[]}
