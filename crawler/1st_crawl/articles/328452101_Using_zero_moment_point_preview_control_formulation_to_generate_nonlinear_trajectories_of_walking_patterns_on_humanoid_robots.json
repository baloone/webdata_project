{"id":"328452101_Using_zero_moment_point_preview_control_formulation_to_generate_nonlinear_trajectories_of_walking_patterns_on_humanoid_robots","abstract":"This paper designs a desired zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory and creates a centre of mass (CoM) trajectory based on this ZMP, in order to solve the problem of generating nonlinear trajectories of walking pattern instability of a humanoid robot. The preview control formulation which follows the planned ZMP patterns while reducing the jerk (acceleration derivation) is considered to implement this trajectory. The walking pattern for bipedal robot is generated by using a cart-table model. After that, the hip and foot trajectories planning that make the robot walk smoothly on the different ground conditions are proposed by using the cycloid function. According to these trajectories, the position of each leg joint of humanoid robot could be determined by inverse kinematics. Then, computer simulations are performed by utilising RecurDyn and MATLAB softwares to validate the proposed preview control formulation for the nonlinear walking patterns generation of a bioloid humanoid robot. Finally, an experimental analysis with the real bioloid robot is also described in this paper.","authors":["Yunn-Lin Hwang","Thi-Na Ta","Kun Nan Chen"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Embedded Systems 10(6):470","DOI:10.1504/IJES.2018.095748","Project: Dynamics"],"references":["247215215_Postural_Stability_of_Biped_Robots_and_the_Foot-Rotation_Indicator_FRI_Point","245321315_Design_of_an_optimal_controller_for_a_discrete-time_system_subject_to_previewable_demand","224211502_Convolution-sum-based_generation_of_walking_patterns_for_uneven_terrains","220671121_Enhancing_Zero_Moment_Point-Based_Control_Model_System_Identification_Approach","282486899_3D_skeleton_construction_by_multi-view_2D_images_and_3D_model_segmentation","264437225_Efficient_run-time_co-simulation_model_switching_for_holistic_analysis_of_embedded_systems","262317317_A_software_tool_for_algebraic_design_of_interval_systems_control","247043583_On_the_Optimal_Digital_State_Vector_Feedback_Controller_With_Integral_and_Preview_Actions","243449495_Robot_Analysis_and_Control","224060452_Trajectory_Free_Linear_Model_Predictive_Control_for_Stable_Walking_in_the_Presence_of_Strong_Perturbations"]}
