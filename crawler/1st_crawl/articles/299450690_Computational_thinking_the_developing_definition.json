{"id":"299450690_Computational_thinking_the_developing_definition","abstract":"Since Jeanette Wingâ€™s use of the term computational thinking in 2006, various discussions have arisen seeking a robust definition of the phrase. With little consensus having been found in the intervening years, there are even suggestions that a definition is not important. Perhaps focus should be on how computational thinking is taught and how its acquisition might be observed. However, in order to facilitate consistent curriculum design and appropriate assessment, it is argued that a definition should still be sought\n\nIn order to contribute to the discussions surrounding a definition of computational thinking, this review of literature spans the years since 2006. The most frequently occurring terms, descriptions, and meanings are identified. Consideration is given to the motivation for inclusion or exclusion of a term by each individual author. Where possible, if a description has been given, an associated term is supplied.\n\nCriteria are developed for the objectives of a computational thinking definition, in accordance with the needs identified in the literature. Using the criteria as a guide and the collected terms as the vocabulary, a definition of computational thinking is proposed which encompasses the thought processes of abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic design, evaluation, and generalization.","authors":["Cynthia Selby","John Woollard"],"meta":["January 2013","Conference: Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) 2014"],"references":[]}
