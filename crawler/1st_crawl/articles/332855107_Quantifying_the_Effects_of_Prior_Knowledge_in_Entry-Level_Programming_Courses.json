{"id":"332855107_Quantifying_the_Effects_of_Prior_Knowledge_in_Entry-Level_Programming_Courses","abstract":"Computer literacy and programming are being taught increasingly at the K-12 level with more students than ever matriculating in college with prior programming experience. Accurately assessing student programming skills acquired in high school can inform college faculty about the range of competencies in introductory programming courses. The tool predominantly-used for assessing past CS knowledge and skills is a survey, which lacks quantitative rigor. This study aims to (1) quantify the effects of prior knowledge in entry-level programming courses and (2) compare the different measurement approaches of student prior knowledge in programming, including surveys and aptitude tests. The results of this study reveal that a discrepancy exists between the results of surveys and aptitude tests. Consistent with prior survey studies, our survey results showed that the effects of student prior programming knowledge faded gradually during the course period. In contrast, the aptitude test results indicated that the effects of student prior knowledge did not weaken over time. The accuracy of both measurements and implications for instructors were further discussed.","authors":["David Hamilton Smith","Qiang Hao","Filip Jagodzinski","Yan Liu"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1145/3300115.3309503","Conference: the ACM Conference"],"references":["310818888_Replication_Validation_and_Use_of_a_Language_Independent_CS1_Knowledge_Assessment","275277145_Predicting_success_How_learners'_prior_knowledge_skills_and_activities_predict_MOOC_performance","267457539_Computer_science_concept_inventories_past_and_future","323324752_Quantifying_the_Benefits_of_Prior_Programming_Experience_in_an_Introductory_Computer_Science_Course","316839836_The_Impact_of_Prior_Programming_Knowledge_on_Lecture_Attendance_and_Final_Exam","313388466_Conversational_agents_improve_peer_learning_through_building_on_prior_knowledge","310824112_Learning_Loops_A_Replication_Study_Illuminates_Impact_of_HS_Courses","309821663_Student_performance_in_computing_education_an_empirical_analysis_of_online_learning_in_programming_education_environments","271478514_Teaching_strategies_for_undergraduate_laboratories_with_students_having_heterogeneous_prior_knowledge","262366692_A_student_perspective_on_prior_experience_in_CS1"]}
