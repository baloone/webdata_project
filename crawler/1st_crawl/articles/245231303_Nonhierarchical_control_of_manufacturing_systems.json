{"id":"245231303_Nonhierarchical_control_of_manufacturing_systems","abstract":"An alternative to the high cost of development, maintenance, operation and modification of complex manufacturing systems with hierarchical architectures is under study at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Nonhierarchical control architectures offer prospects of reduced complexity by localizing information and control, reducing software development costs, increasing maintanability and modifiability, and improving reliability.","authors":["Neil A.
