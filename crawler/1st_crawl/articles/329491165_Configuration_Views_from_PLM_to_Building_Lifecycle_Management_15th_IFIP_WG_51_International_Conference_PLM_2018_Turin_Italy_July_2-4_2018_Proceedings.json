To this aim, the authors analyzed the concept of “configuration view”, or better, “Product Structure configuration”, of complex manufacturing and whether it has been already applied to process or information management of different lifecycle phases of the AEC industry. Starting from the representation of the configuration views in PLM, the final objective is to identify gaps in the current BIM technological process and to propose a customized Product Structure based on personalized configuration views in the Construction World to implementing the Building Lifecycle Management (BLM).","authors":["Carla Di Biccari","Giovanna Mangialardi","Mariangela Lazoi","Angelo Corallo"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-01614-2_7","In book: Product Lifecycle Management to Support Industry 4.0 (pp.69-79)"],"references":["321692029_BIM_and_PLM_Associations_in_Current_Literature","283962838_Innovative_Research_Projects_in_the_Field_of_Building_Lifecycle_Management","273847283_Configuration_Management_in_Complex_Engineering_Projects","272886497_Computer_Integrated_Construction_-_A_Major_STEP_Forward","271272707_Digital_Mock-up","242406360_Analysis_of_Standards_for_Lifecycle_Management_of_Systems_for_US_Army_---_a_preliminary_investigation","235914998_Product_Lifecycle_Management_Model_for_Design_Information_Management_in_Mechanical_Field","229020941_Building_lifecycle_management","220517486_Strategies_for_Product_Structure_Management_at_Manufacturing_Firms","321523458_Product_Lifecycle_Management_Volume_2","316800565_Decision_Engineering","314866271_Comparing_PLM_and_BIM_from_the_Product_Structure_Standpoint","300567454_On_the_implementation_of_product_model_interfaces_in_CIME","299675789_Lessons_Learned_for_Better_Management_of_Master_Geometry","292684875_Product_lifecycle_management_Second_edition","271972387_The_Product_Structure_Evolution_Model_for_Maintenance_Based_on_Finite_Automaton","243784093_Building_Product_Models-Computer_Environments_Supporting_Design_and_Construction","236660929_Product_Modelling","223616186_Basic_structure_of_a_proposed_building_product_model","222576191_Deployment_of_an_AEC_industry_sector_product_model","222426391_IFC_and_Buildings_Lifecycle_Management","222203440_Product_modeling_standards_for_the_building_and_construction_industry_Past_present_and_future","222083928_A_generic_building_product_model_incorporating_building_type_information"]}
