These criteria are compared to others in the literature. Some of our results are interpreted as tradeoff results or as showing the inherent relative-computational complexity of certain processes and others are interpreted from a positivistic, mechanistic philosophical stance as theorems in philosophy of science. The techniques of recursive function theory are employed including ordinary and infinitary recursion theorems.","authors":["John William Case","Carl Smith"],"meta":["March 1983Theoretical Computer Science 25(2):193–220","DOI:10.1016/0304-3975(83)90061-0","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["266523747_Comparing_various_concepts_of_function_prediction_Part_I","221590773_Classes_of_Computable_Functions_Defined_by_Bounds_on_Computation_Preliminary_Report","220976535_Towards_a_Theory_of_Inductive_Inference","292115340_CLASSES_OF_COMPUTABLE_FUNCTIONS_DEFINED_BY_BOUNDS_ON_COMPUTATION_PRELIMINARY_REPORT","284692849_Goedel_numberings_and_partial_recursive_functions","284677679_Prognostication_of_automata_and_functions","268673288_Identification_in_the_limit_of_minimal_Godel_numbers","247925238_The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discover","242383797_On_the_prediction_of_general_recursive_functions","240185449_Prediction_and_limiting_synthesis_of_effectively_enumerable_classes_of_functions","238754618_Classes_of_computable_functions_defined_by_bounds_on_computation","238674374_Two_theorems_on_the_limiting_synthesis_of_functions","235737569_The_Logic_of_Scientific_Disovery","235737530_Progress_and_Its_Problems","234812969_An_Introduction_to_the_General_Theory_of_Algorithms","226506378_On_a_Theory_of_Inductive_Inference","223144507_Research_in_the_theory_of_inductive_inference_by_GDR_mathematicians-A_survey","223126987_Some_natural_properties_of_strong-identification_in_inductive_inference","222870490_On_the_Size_of_Machines","222844403_Toward_a_mathematical_theory_of_inductive_inference","222508351_Some_decidability_results_on_grammatical_inference_and_complexity","222445347_Language_Identification_in_the_Limit","221591496_Anomaly_Hierarchies_of_Mechanized_Inductive_Inference","221331397_Prognostication_of_Automata_and_Functions","221150556_On_the_Error_Correcting_Power_of_Pluralism_in_Inductive_Inference","220976872_Minimal_Godel_Numbers_and_Their_Identification_in_the_Limit","220897679_Machine_Inductive_Inference_and_Language_Identification","220896870_Characterization_Problems_in_the_Theory_of_Inductive_Inference","220544345_Periodicity_in_Generations_of_Automata","220432202_The_Power_of_Pluralism_for_Automatic_Program_Synthesis","220246534_Tradeoffs_in_the_Inductive_Inference_of_Nearly_Minimal_Size_Programs","38377084_Godel_Numberings_of_Partial_Recursive_Functions","35374880_Refinements_of_inductive_inference_by_Popperian_machines","34803149_A_Machine-Independent_Theory_of_the_Complexity_of_Recursive_Functions"]}
