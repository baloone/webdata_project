{"id":"265610495_Dynamics_of_Chemotactic_Droplets_in_Salt_Concentration_Gradients","abstract":"The chemotactic movement of decanol droplets in aqueous solutions of sodium decanoate in response to concentration gradients of NaCl has been investigated. Key parameters of the chemotactic response, namely the induction time and the migration velocity, have been evaluated as function of the sodium decanoate concentration and the NaCl concentration gradient. The ability of the decanol droplets to migrate in concentration gradients has been demonstrated not only in a linear chemotactic assay but also in a topologically complex environment. Additionally, the ability to reverse the direction of movement repeatedly, to carry and release a chemically reactive cargo, to select a stronger concentration gradient from two options and to initiate chemotaxis by an external temperature stimulus, have been demonstrated.","authors":["Jitka Cejkova","Matěj Novák","Frantisek Stepanek","Martin M.
