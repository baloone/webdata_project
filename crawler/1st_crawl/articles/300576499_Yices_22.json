{"id":"300576499_Yices_22","abstract":"Yices is an SMT solver developed by SRI International. The first version of Yices was released in 2006 and has been continuously updated since then. In 2007, we started a complete re-implementation of the solver to improve performance and increase modularity and flexibility. We describe the latest release of Yices, namely, Yices 2.2. We present the toolâ€™s architecture and discuss the algorithms it implements, and we describe recent developments such as support for the SMT-LIB 2.0 notation and various performance improvements.","authors":["Bruno Dutertre"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_49","Conference: International Conference on Computer Aided Verification"],"references":["267800834_SMTInterpol_an_Interpolating_SMT_Solver","262365576_The_MathSAT5_SMT_solver","237843157_EFSMT_A_Logical_Framework_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems","225142568_Z3_an_efficient_SMT_solver","222302488_Model-based_Theory_Combination","221403015_Efficient_Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories_via_Delayed_Theory_Combination","220805721_veriT_An_Open_Trustable_and_Efficient_SMT-Solver","220805642_Exploiting_Symmetry_in_SMT_Problems","3187684_Formal_Verification_for_Fault-Tolerant_Architectures_Prolegomena_to_the_Design_of_PVS","2942131_Simplify_A_Theorem_Prover_for_Program_Checking","228777487_The_smt-lib_standard_Version_12","226561665_Deciding_Combinations_of_Theories","225356179_Synthesizing_Switching_Logic_Using_Constraint_Solving","221555359_Oracle-guided_component-based_program_synthesis","221403006_CVC4","221402940_A_fast_linear-arithmetic_solver_for_DPLL_T","220944464_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220805905_The_ICS_Decision_Procedures_for_Embedded_Deduction","220432025_Deciding_Combinations_of_Theories","220404286_Simplification_by_Cooperating_Decision_Procedures","220248538_Fast_congruence_closure_and_extensions","2357662_PVS_A_Prototype_Verification_System"]}
