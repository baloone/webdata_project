{"id":"315830615_Endowing_a_plain_fluidic_chip_with_micro-optics_a_holographic_microscope_slide","abstract":"Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) devices are extremely promising in that they enable diagnostic functions at the point-of-care. Within this scope, an important goal is to design imaging schemes that can be used out of the lab. In this paper, we introduce and test a pocket holographic slide that allows Digital Holography microscopy to be performed without an interferometer setup. Instead, a commercial off-the-shelf plastic chip is engineered and functionalized with this aim. The microfluidic chip is endowed with micro-optics, i.e., a diffraction grating and polymeric lenses, to build an interferometer directly on the chip, avoiding the need for a reference arm and external bulky optical components. Thanks to the single-beam scheme, the system is completely integrated and robust against vibrations, sharing the useful features of any common path interferometer. Hence, it becomes possible to bring holographic functionalities out of the lab, moving complexity from the external optical apparatus to the chip itself. Label-free imaging and quantitative phase contrast mapping of live samples are demonstrated, along with flexible refocusing capabilities. Thus, a liquid volume can be analyzed in one single shot with no need for mechanical scanning systems.","authors":["Vittorio Bianco","Biagio Mandracchia","Valentina Marchesano","Vito Pagliarulo"],"meta":["April 2017Light: Science & Applications 6(9)","DOI:10.1038/lsa.2017.55","Project: LAN ON A CHIP FOR BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE BY CHORENT MICROSCOPY IN DIGITAL HOLOGRAPHY MODALITY"],"references":["301481409_Investigating_fibroblast_cells_under_safe_and_injurious_blue-light_exposure_by_holographic_microscopy","295900300_Nanomechanics_of_Suspended_Fibroblast_by_Point-like_Anchors_Reveals_Cytoskeleton_Formation","286625371_Forward_electrohydrodynamic_inkjet_printing_of_optical_microlenses_on_microfluidic_devices","283256247_Portable_lensless_wide-field_microscopy_imaging_platform_based_on_digital_inline_holography_and_multi-frame_pixel_super-resolution","276211008_Label-free_characterization_of_white_blood_cells_by_measuring_3D_refractive_index_maps","270004424_Three-part_differential_of_unlabeled_leukocytes_with_a_compact_lens-free_imaging_flow_cytometer","268283600_LED-based_digital_holographic_microscopy_with_slightly_off-axis_interferometry","265420307_Spatio-temporal_scanning_modality_for_synthesizing_interferograms_and_digital_holograms","263706392_A_light-sheet_microscope_compatible_with_mobile_devices_for_label-free_intracellular_imaging_and_biosensing","262936991_Single_beam_Fourier_transform_digital_holographic_quantitative_phase_microscopy","261257609_4D_tracking_of_clinical_seminal_samples_for_quantitative_characterization_of_motility_parameters","260636195_Clear_Microfluidics_Imaging_Through_Flowing_Blood_by_Digital_Holography","260375013_Lensless_phase_contrast_microscopy_based_on_multiwavelength_Fresnel_diffraction","260152305_Off-axis_digital_holographic_microscopy_with_LED_illumination_based_on_polarization_filtering","253650674_Marker-free_phase_nanoscopy","232225484_High-throughput_screening_of_large_volumes_of_whole_blood_using_structured_illumination_and_fluorescent_on-chip_imaging","230643288_Optical_imaging_techniques_in_microfluidics_and_their_applications","225301111_Direct_printing_of_nanostructures_by_electrostatic_autofocussing_of_ink_nanodroplets","49720055_Holographic_opto-fluidic_microscopy","44583888_Dispensing_nano-pico_droplets_and_liquid_patterning_by_pyroelectrodynamic_shooting","43160608_Phase_retrieval_algorithms_a_comparison","40443366_Quantitative_imaging_of_cellular_adhesion_by_total_internal_reflection_holographic_microscopy","6915631_Microfluidic_Diagnostic_Technologies_for_Global_Public_Health","6694498_Optofluidic_microscopy_-_A_method_for_implementing_a_high_resolution_optical_microscope_on_a_chip","6161278_Solution_to_the_Twin_Image_Problem_in_Holography","305803171_Dual-wavelength_digital_holography_with_a_single_low-coherence_light_source","288968679_The_origins_and_the_future_of_microfluidics","274514843_Self-propelling_bacteria_mimic_coherent_light_decorrelation","273957678_Optofluidic_holographic_microscopy_with_custom_Field_of_View_by_a_linear_array_detector","273187493_Diagnostic_Tools_for_Lab-on-Chip_Applications_Based_on_Coherent_Imaging_Microscopy","265138256_Flow-Scanning_Optical_Tomography","264503243_Microfluidic_organs-on-chips","253107772_Partially_coherent_fields_the_transport-of-intensity_equation_and_phase_uniqueness","230871867_High-throughput_lensfree_3D_tracking_of_human_sperms_reveals_rare_statistics_of_helical_trajectories","228081995_Full_off-axis_red-green-blue_digital_holographic_microscope_with_LED_illumination","228028415_Interference_lithography_A_powerful_tool_for_fabricating_periodic_structures","221841663_Phase_imaging_flow_cytometry_using_a_focus-stack_collecting_microscope","51135116_Optofluidic_Tomography_on_a_Chip","45538864_Detection_of_waterborne_parasites_using_field-portable_and_cost-effective_lensfree_microscopy","24279073_Nanoscale_Patterns_of_Oligonucleotides_Formed_by_Electrohydrodynamic_Jet_Printing_with_Applications_in_Biosensing_and_Nanomaterials_Assembly","11775295_Digital_in-line_holography_for_biological_applications","9032582_Microfluidic_Devices_for_the_High-Throughput_Chemical_Analysis_of_Cells","6915630_Cells_on_chips","6915625_Whitesides_GM_The_origins_and_the_future_of_microfluidics_Nature_442_368-373","5258013_General_theoretical_formulation_of_image_formation_in_digital_Fresnel_holography"]}
