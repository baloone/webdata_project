{"id":"257069435_Causal_Discovery_with_Continuous_Additive_Noise_Models","abstract":"We consider the problem of learning causal directed acyclic graphs from an\nobservational joint distribution. One can use these graphs to predict the\noutcome of interventional experiments, from which data are often not available.\nWe show that if the observational distribution follows a structural equation\nmodel with an additive noise structure, the directed acyclic graph becomes\nidentifiable from the distribution under mild conditions. This constitutes an\ninteresting alternative to traditional methods that assume faithfulness and\nidentify the Markov equivalence class of the graph, i.e., leaving some edges\nundirected. We provide practical algorithms for finitely many samples and\nprovide an empirical evaluation.","authors":["Jonas Peters","Joris Mooij","Dominik Janzing","Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf"],"meta":["September 2013Journal of Machine Learning Research 15(1)","DOI:10.15496/publikation-1672","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258849775_Score-based_Causal_Learning_in_Additive_Noise_Models","257409889_CAM_Causal_Additive_Models_high-dimensional_order_search_and_penalized_regression","254883062_On_causal_discovery_with_cyclic_additive_noise_models","251188458_Testing_conditional_independence_for_continuous_random_variables","329654602_Causation_Prediction_and_Search","275697437_Causality_Models_Reasoning_and_Inference","267667861_Analyse_generale_des_liaisons_stochastiques_Etude_particuliere_de_l'analyse_factorielle_lineaire","265830001_Pairwise_Likelihood_Ratios_for_Estimation_of_Non-Gaussian_Structural_Equation_Models","265562314_Linear_combinations_of_independent_random_variables_and_the_normal_distribution_law","255620499_Asymmetries_of_Time_Series_under_Inverting_their_Direction","237053920_Structural_Intervention_Distance_SID_for_Evaluating_Causal_Graphs","242575516_Conditional_Independence_in_Statistical_Theory","237128128_Graphical_Models_Selecting_causal_and_statistical_models","235726738_Learning_Gaussian_Networks","228333656_Ordering-Based_Search_A_Simple_and_Effective_Algorithm_for_LearningBayesian_Networks"]}
