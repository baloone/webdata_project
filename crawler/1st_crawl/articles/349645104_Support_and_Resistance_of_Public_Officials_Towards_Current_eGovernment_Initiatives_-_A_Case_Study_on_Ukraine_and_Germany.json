{"id":"349645104_Support_and_Resistance_of_Public_Officials_Towards_Current_eGovernment_Initiatives_-_A_Case_Study_on_Ukraine_and_Germany","abstract":"This article provides insights on how German and Ukrainian public sector employees perceive and position themselves towards current eGovernment initiatives. After presenting the academic literature on the roles of individual public servants in trans-formative change processes in public administration , the eGovernment approaches followed by Germany and Ukraine are explained. The results of a survey (=) conducted among public servants in both countries provide information on their perceived contribution to and participation in the digitisation of government service delivery, as well as reasons and causes for motivation or frustration in this context. By analysing the survey responses and identifying potential impediments of successful eGovernment implementation, the authors provide recommendations for action for executives that drive digital transformation, such as organising tool-specific training and Single Points of Contact for employees after introducing new processes and software, adjusting educational programmes for new public servants, and establishing a feedback and knowledge-sharing culture when creating new e-services.","authors":["Florian Lemke","Konstantin Ehrhardt","Olha Popelyshyn"],"meta":["February 2021","DOI:10.3224/dms.v14i1.08","Project: Digitizing government service delivery: Motivational repercussions on public sector employees â€“ a case study of Ukraine and Germany"],"references":["341711779_Is_the_turtle_still_plodding_along_Public_management_reform_in_Germany","334184935_Digitale_Transformation_als_Reformvorhaben_der_deutschen_offentlichen_Verwaltung","319860317_Managing_Successful_Change_Efforts_in_the_Public_Sector_An_Employee's_Readiness_for_Change_Perspective","319010920_Decentralization_Reform_in_Ukraine_Assessment_of_the_Chosen_Transformation_Model","342899681_Core_-_competencies_-_a_key_to_future_-_oriented_and_sustainable_e-governance_implementation_a_mixed_method_research","339743965_Use_of_Information_Technology_to_Increase_Economic_Efficiency_and_Credibility_in_Public_Administration_in_the_Context_of_Digitization","333770098_On_Leveraging_the_Potential_of_Open_Data_to_Enhance_Transparency_and_Accountability_-_A_Case_Study_from_Ukraine_-","301760640_Emergent_digital_era_governance_Enacting_the_role_of_the_'institutional_entrepreneur'_in_transformational_change","283524029_Resistance_of_Public_Personnel_to_Open_Government_A_cognitive_theory_view_of_implementation_barriers_towards_open_government_data","282311895_Digital_government_evolution_From_transformation_to_contextualization"]}
