In order to solve the problem that the existing algorithms always need prior knowledge, we proposed a fast searching density peak clustering algorithm based on the shared nearest neighbor and adaptive clustering center (DPC-SNNACC) algorithm. It can automatically ascertain the number of knee points in the decision graph according to the characteristics of different datasets, and further determine the number of clustering centers without human intervention. First, an improved calculation method of local density based on the symmetric distance matrix was proposed. Then, the position of knee point was obtained by calculating the change in the difference between decision values. Finally, the experimental and comparative evaluation of several datasets from diverse domains established the viability of the DPC-SNNACC algorithm.","authors":["Yi Lv","Mandan Liu","Yue Xiang"],"meta":["December 2020Symmetry 12(12):2014","DOI:10.3390/sym12122014"],"references":["343130446_Improving_Density_Peak_Clustering_by_Automatic_Peak_Selection_and_Single_Linkage_Clustering","341211969_A_Double-Density_Clustering_Method_Based_on_Nearest_to_First_in_Strategy","321640471_From_Partition-Based_Clustering_to_Density-Based_Clustering_Fast_Find_Clusters_With_Diverse_Shapes_and_Densities_in_Spatial_Databases","307873746_Adaptive_fuzzy_clustering_by_fast_search_and_find_of_density_peaks","342237422_Turning_Big_Data_Into_Tiny_Data_Constant-Size_Coresets_for_k-Means_PCA_and_Projective_Clustering","328186177_I-CFSFDP_A_Robust_and_High_Accuracy_Clustering_Method_Based_on_CFSFDP","324286003_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","323870976_Shared-Nearest-Neighbor-Based_Clustering_by_Fast_Search_and_Find_of_Density_Peaks","316600283_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","298807366_Robust_clustering_by_detecting_density_peaks_and_assigning_points_based_on_fuzzy_weighted_K-nearest_neighbors","290473436_Study_of_transpedicular_screw_fixation_on_spine_development_in_a_piglet_model","295750465_Data_clustering_A_user's_dilemma","293804713_Study_on_Density_Peaks_Clustering_Based_on_k-Nearest_Neighbors_and_Principal_Component_Analysis","292344173_Delta-Density_based_clustering_with_a_Divide-and-Conquer_strategy_3DC_clustering","286054673_Spectral_clustering_algorithm_based_on_adaptive_Nystrom_sampling_for_big_data_analysis"]}
