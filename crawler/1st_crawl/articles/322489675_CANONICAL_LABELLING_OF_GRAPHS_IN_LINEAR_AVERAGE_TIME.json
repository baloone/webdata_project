{"id":"322489675_CANONICAL_LABELLING_OF_GRAPHS_IN_LINEAR_AVERAGE_TIME","abstract":"Canonical labeling (CL) of graphs can be used, e. g. , to test isomorphism. It is proved that a simple vertex classification procedure results after only two refinement steps in a CL of random graphs with probability 1 minus exp( minus cn). With a slight modification one obtains a linear time CL algorithm with only exp( minus cn log n/log log n) probability of failure. An additional depth-first search yields a CL of all graphs in linear average time.","authors":["Laszlo Babai","Ludik Kucera"],"meta":["January 1979"],"references":[]}
