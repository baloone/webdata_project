{"id":"262273915_Complete_Lattices_and_Up-To_Techniques","abstract":"We propose a theory of up-to techniques for proofs by coinduction, in the setting of complete lattices. This theory improves over existing results by providing a way to compose arbitrarily complex techniques with standard techniques, expressed using a very simple and modular semi-commutation property.\nComplete lattices are enriched with monoid operations, so that we can recover standard results about labelled transitions systems and their associated behavioural equivalences at an abstract, “point-free” level.\nOur theory gives for free a powerful method for validating up-to techniques. We use it to revisit up to contexts techniques, which are known to be difficult in the weak case: we show that it is sufficient to check basic conditions about each operator of the language, and then rely on an iteration technique to deduce general results for all contexts.","authors":["Damien Pous"],"meta":["November 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-76637-7_24","SourceOAI","Conference: Proceedings of the 5th Asian conference on Programming languages and systems"],"references":["222385601_Typed_behavioural_equivalences_for_processes_in_the_presence_of_subtyping","221221785_An_Asynchronous_Distributed_Implementation_of_Mobile_Ambients","318671138_Typed_behavioural_equivalences_for_processes_in_the_presence_of_subtyping","266425464_The_p-Calculus_A_Theory_of_Mobile_Processes","243220050_Up-to_Techniques_for_Weak_Bisimulation","227139184_An_efficiency_preorder_for_processes","226547745_An_efficiency_preorder_for_processes","225035741_Introduction_to_Lattices_and_Order_-_2nd_Ed","224001269_Communication_and_Concurrency","222706079_A_hierarchy_of_equivalences_for_asynchronous_calculi","222449825_On_reduction-based_process_semantics","222005741_A_calculational_approach_to_mathematical_induction","221621820_The_Join_Calculus_A_Language_for_Distributed_Mobile_Programming","221530770_On_Bisimulation_Proofs_for_the_Analysis_of_Distributed_Abstract_Machines","220700882_The_Problem_of_Weak_Bisimulation_up_to''","220700503_Weak_Bisimulation_Up_to_Elaboration","220690132_The_Pi-Calculus_-_a_theory_of_mobile_processes","213876800_Up-to_techniques_for_weak_bisimulation","38347971_A_Lattice-Theoretical_Fixpoint_Theorem_and_Its_Applications","4263860_Environmental_Bisimulations_for_Higher-Order_Languages","2816767_On_the_Bisimulation_Proof_Method","2639721_Conformance_A_Precongruence_Close_to_Bisimilarity","2493112_Relational_Reasoning_about_Contexts","2427398_Proving_Congruence_of_Bisimulation_in_Functional_Programming_Languages"]}
