{"id":"334431266_Mortal_Brownian_motion_Three_short_stories","abstract":"Mortality introduces an intrinsic time scale into the scale-invariant Brownian motion. This fact has important consequences for different statistics of Brownian motion. Here we are telling three short stories, where spontaneous death, such as radioactive decay, puts a natural limit to “lifetime achievements” of a Brownian particle. In story 1 we determine the probability distribution of a mortal Brownian particle (MBP) reaching a specified point in space at the time of its death. In story 2 we determine the probability distribution of the area A = [Formula: see text] x(t)dt of an MBP on the line. Story 3 addresses the distribution of the winding angle of an MBP wandering around a reflecting disk in the plane. In stories 1 and 2 the probability distributions exhibit integrable singularities at zero values of the position and the area, respectively. In story 3 a singularity at zero winding angle appears only in the limit of very high mortality. A different integrable singularity appears at a nonzero winding angle. It is inherited from the recently uncovered singularity of the short-time large-deviation function of the winding angle for immortal Brownian motion.","authors":["Baruch Meerson"],"meta":["July 2019International Journal of Modern Physics B 33(16):1950172","DOI:10.1142/S0217979219501728"],"references":["324822957_Brownian_Motion_of_Radioactive_Particles_Derivation_and_Monte_Carlo_Test_of_Spatial_and_Temporal_Distributions","320563022_Brownian_Motion_of_Decaying_Particles_Transition_Probability_Computer_Simulation_and_First-Passage_Times","311066882_The_escape_problem_for_mortal_walkers","309168184_Method_to_Measure_Indoor_Radon_Concentration_in_an_Open_Volume_with_Geiger-Mueller_Counters_Analysis_from_First_Principles","272845815_Mortality_Redundancy_and_Diversity_in_Stochastic_Search","262805403_Winding_statistics_of_a_Brownian_particle_on_a_ring","260003937_Evanescent_continuous-time_random_walks","239944064_Exploration_and_Trapping_of_Mortal_Random_Walkers","1897579_Tail_estimates_for_the_Brownian_excursion_area_and_other_Brownian_areas","331336387_Geometrical_optics_of_constrained_Brownian_excursion_From_the_KPZ_scaling_to_dynamical_phase_transitions","330740614_Large_fluctuations_of_the_area_under_a_constrained_Brownian_excursion","272195018_The_number_statistics_and_optimal_history_of_a_non-equilibrium_steady_state_of_mortal_diffusing_particles","268317054_Handbook_of_Brownian_Motion-Facts_and_Formulae","266226131_Differential_equations_and_the_calculus_of_variations","261915123_Macroscopic_fluctuation_theory","230903430_The_winding_angle_distribution_of_an_ordinary_random_walk","38360996_Windings_of_Random_Walks","13327373_Winding-angle_distribution_for_Brownian_and_self-avoiding_walks","1846647_Brownian_Functionals_in_Physics_and_Computer_Science"]}
