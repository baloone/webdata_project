{"id":"243040674_P-adic_Brownian_motion","abstract":"A p-adic analogue of Brownian motion is constructed and studied. The properties of the trajectories of a p-adic Wiener process are studied using Vladimirov's p-adic differentiation operator. To construct the p-adic Brownian motion we use a p-adic analogue of the Paley-Wiener method and a stochastic pseudodifferential equation.","authors":["Albert Kh.
