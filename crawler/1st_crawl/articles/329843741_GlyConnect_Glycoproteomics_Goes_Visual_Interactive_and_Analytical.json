{"id":"329843741_GlyConnect_Glycoproteomics_Goes_Visual_Interactive_and_Analytical","abstract":"Knowledge of glycoproteins, their site-specific glycosylation patterns and the glycan structures that they present to their recognition partners in health and disease are gradually being built on using a range of experimental approaches. The data from these analyses are increasingly being standardised and presented in various sources, from supplemental tables in publications to localised servers in investigator laboratories. Bioinformatics tools are now needed to collect this data and enable the user to search, display and connect glycomics and glycoproteomics to other sources of related proteomics, genomics and interactomics information. We here introduce GlyConnect (https://glyconnect.expasy.org/), the central platform of the Glycomics@ExPASy portal for glycoinformatics. GlyConnect has been developed to gather, monitor, integrate and visualize data in a user-friendly way in order to facilitate the interpretation of collected glycoscience data. GlyConnect is designed to accommodate and integrate multiple data types as they are increasingly produced.","authors":["Davide Alocci","Julien Mariethoz","Alessandra Gastaldello","Elisabeth Gasteiger"],"meta":["December 2018Journal of Proteome Research 18(2)","DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00766","Project: glycomics@ExPASy"],"references":["329437743_SugarSketcher_Quick_and_Intuitive_Online_Glycan_Drawing","327264362_e-workflow_for_recording_of_glycomic_mass_spectrometric_data_in_compliance_with_reporting_guidelines","326964908_GlycomicsExPASy_Bridging_the_gap","322991344_UniProt_the_universal_protein_knowledgebase","322866748_Large-scale_intact_glycopeptide_identification_by_Mascot_database_search","284171771_SugarBindDB_a_resource_of_glycan-mediated_host-pathogen_interactions","283641570_Human_plasma_protein_N-glycosylation","283523614_Symbol_Nomenclature_for_Graphical_Representations_of_Glycans","273386320_Glyco3D_A_Portal_for_Structural_Glycosciences","260376908_Toolboxes_for_a_standardised_and_systematic_study_of_glycans","258854804_The_Carbohydrate-active_enzymes_database_CAZy_in_2013","235398697_The_Minimum_Information_Required_for_a_Glycomics_Experiment_MIRAGE_Project_Improving_the_Standards_for_Reporting_Mass-spectrometry-based_Glycoanalytic_Data","230742131_The_GlycomeAtlas_tool_for_visualizing_and_querying_glycome_data","228461003_A_Normal_Form_for_Preventing_Redundant_Tuples_in_Relational_Databases","220021430_Uberon_an_integrative_multi-species_anatomy_ontology","51852054_The_NCBI_taxonomy_database","51796080_Disease_Ontology_A_backbone_for_disease_semantic_integration","47621450_The_BRENDA_Tissue_Ontology_BTO_The_first_all-integrating_ontology_of_all_organisms_for_enzyme_sources","45508420_GeneCards_Version_3_The_human_gene_integrator","44629501_GlycoViewer_A_tool_for_visual_summary_and_comparative_analysis_of_the_glycome","7526090_GLYCOSCIENCESde_an_internet_portal_to_support_glycomics_and_glycobiology_research","6155168_The_GlycanBuilder_A_fast_intuitive_and_flexible_software_tool_for_building_and_displaying_glycan_structures","327430242_Rapidly_Display_Glycan_Symbols_in_3D_Structures_3D-SNFG_in_LiteMol","326955265_Predicting_the_Structures_of_Glycans_Glycoproteins_and_Their_Complexes","325306385_Glycoinformatics_Bridging_Isolated_Islands_in_the_Sea_of_Data","325053578_Reanalysis_of_Global_Proteomic_and_Phosphoproteomic_Data_Identified_a_Large_Number_of_Glycopeptides","323663767_Understanding_the_glycome_An_interactive_view_of_glycosylation_from_glycocompositions_to_glycoepitopes","323194399_How_many_human_proteoforms_are_there","322008856_GlycoDomainViewer_A_bioinformatics_tool_for_contextual_exploration_of_glycoproteomes","321409324_LiteMol_suite_Interactive_web-based_visualization_of_large-scale_macromolecular_structure_data","320540092_GlyTouCan_An_accessible_glycan_structure_repository","309155828_Databases_and_Associated_Tools_for_Glycomics_and_Glycoproteomics","306131453_GlycoSiteAlign_Glycosite_Alignment_Based_on_Glycan_Structure","274418125_GlycoSuiteDB_a_new_curated_relational_database_of_glycoprotein_glycan_structures_and_their_biological_sources","269468453_ProSight_Lite_Graphical_software_to_analyze_top-down_mass_spectrometry_data","259336806_The_next_level_of_complexity_Crosstalk_of_posttranslational_modifications","244741133_Nomenclature_of_glycoproteins_glycopeptides_and_peptidoglycans_Recommendations_1985","233836724_neXtProt_Organizing_Protein_Knowledge_in_the_Context_of_Human_Proteome_Projects","220422209_A_Simple_Guide_to_Five_Normal_Forms_in_Relational_Database_Theory","38079181_Symbol_nomenclature_for_glycan_representation","26731798_Proposal_for_a_standard_system_for_drawing_structural_diagrams_of_N_-_and_O_-linked_carbohydrates_and_related_compounds","20531977_The_Complex_Carbohydrate_Structure_Database","8532940_UniMod_Protein_modifications_for_mass_spectrometry","7297809_Advancing_glycomics_Implementation_strategies_at_the_Consortium_for_Functional_Glycomics","5417107_GlycoCT_-_a_unifying_sequence_format_for_carbohydrates"]}
