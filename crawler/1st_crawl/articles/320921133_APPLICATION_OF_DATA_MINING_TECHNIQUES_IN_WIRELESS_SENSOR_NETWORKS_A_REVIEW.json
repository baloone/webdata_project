{"id":"320921133_APPLICATION_OF_DATA_MINING_TECHNIQUES_IN_WIRELESS_SENSOR_NETWORKS_A_REVIEW","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Network is one of the most important technologies, which is being used in computer science. It consists of smart sensor nodes which can sense and communicative in a wireless fashion in a defined a network and it get the data to sink. The sink is connected to gateway and collected data's are sent to the base station. Sensors have many constraints like limited resources, energy, memory, computation power etc. Data Mining is used to evaluate data from several dimensions and is the process of finding pattern in a large relational database. The purpose of using data mining is to increase the efficiency of the sensor nodes. The main objective of this review focused on distinct data mining techniques which have been adopted by WSN showing their advantages and disadvantages with various types of applications.","authors":["Shylaja .S","Muralidharan R"],"meta":["June 2017"],"references":["307560128_Energy_Saving_In_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Using_Burst_Algorithm","299423480_Data_Mining_Techniques_Applied_to_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Early_Forest_Fire_Detection","276031888_Mining_Data_Generated_by_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","271509441_Nearest_neighbour_classification_for_wireless_sensor_network_data","268210849_A_New_Approach_for_Decreasing_Energy_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_with_Hybrid_LEACH_Protocol_and_Fuzzy_C-Means_Algorithm","321073758_Comparative_Analysis_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_Applied_to_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Data_for_Fire_Detection","298864188_Wireless_sensor_networking","290526169_A_data_collection_approach_based_on_mobile_sink_in_wireless_sensor_networks","284346579_Data_Relay_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Data_Mining_Approach","275412721_Automated_Health_Alerts_Using_In-Home_Sensor_Data_for_Embedded_Health_Assessment"]}
