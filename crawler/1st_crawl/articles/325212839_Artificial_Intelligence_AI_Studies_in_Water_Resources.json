{"id":"325212839_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_Studies_in_Water_Resources","abstract":"Artificial intelligence has been extensively used in many areas such as computer science, robotics, engineering, medicine, translation, economics, business, and psychology. Various studies in the literature show that the artificial intelligence in modeling approaches give close results to the real data for solution of linear, non-linear, and other systems. In this study, we reviewed the current state-of-the-art and progress on the modelling of artificial intelligence for water variables: rainfall-runoff, evaporation and evapotranspiration, streamflow, sediment, water quality variables, and dam or lake water level changes. Moreover, the study has also identified some future research possibilities and suggestions for modelling of the water variables.","authors":["Murat Ay","Serhat Özyıldırım"],"meta":["May 2018Natural and Engineering Sciences 3(2):187-195","DOI:10.28978/nesciences.424674"],"references":["317213418_Modern_Optimization_Methods_in_Water_Resources_Planning_Engineering_and_Management","305671697_Comparison_of_random_forests_and_other_statistical_methods_for_the_prediction_of_lake_water_level_A_case_study_of_the_Poyang_Lake_in_China","305661794_Modeling_of_hydrophobic_cohesive_sediment_transport_in_the_Ells_River_Alberta_Canada","284755161_Dissolved_oxygen_prediction_using_a_possibility-theory_based_fuzzy_neural_network","313758754_An_algorithm_for_least-squares_estimation_of_non-linear_parameters","312039203_Estimation_of_suspended_sediment_load_using_regression_trees_and_model_trees_approaches_Case_study_Hyderabad_drainage_basin_in_Iran","311500325_Downscaling_future_projections_of_monthly_precipitation_in_a_catchment_with_varying_physiography","310734177_Regional_fuzzy_chain_model_for_evapotranspiration_estimation","310506403_Modelling_daily_reference_evapotranspiration_in_humid_locations_of_South_Korea_using_local_and_cross-station_data_management_scenarios","297672788_Review_of_dependence_modeling_in_hydrology_and_water_resources"]}
