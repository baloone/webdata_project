{"id":"344718894_Modeling_of_polyphenols_extraction_from_pomegranate_by-product_using_rotatable_central_composite_design_of_experiments","abstract":"There is a growing request to find an effective method of polyphenols extraction from agro-industry by-product as pomegranate. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to explore the effect of three factors on ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE) of total polyphenols (TP), total flavonoids (TF) and condensed tan-nins (CT) from pomegranate peels. The optimal conditions were determined for each phenolic compound using regression model equations and 3-D plots. The high TP, TF and CT content were obtained with, respectively, liquid/solid ratio of 20.00, 9.77, 9.77, extraction time of 36.38, 41.82, 30.39 min and 36.00, 83.64, 59.26% of eth-anol percentage. In fact, liquid/solid ratio of 20, extraction time of 30.94 min and 59.26% of ethanol gives the highest contents of TP, TF and CT simultaneously. The experimental values using optimal conditions agreed with the predicted values. The pomegranate peels extract obtained under optimum conditions have an effective antioxidant activity as determined by ABTS and DPPH assays.","authors":["Zayneb Hayder","Walid Elfalleh","Khajida Ben Othmen","Mohamed Ali Benabderrahim"],"meta":["October 2020Acta Ecologica Sinica 41(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.chnaes.2020.10.003","Project: Evaluation of biochemical and bioactive properties of pomegranate (Punica Granatum L.)"],"references":["344175447_Amino_and_fatty_acids_composition_of_olive_stones_for_the_discrimination_of_Olea_europaea_subsp_europaea_varieties","337749181_Tannin_Basic_Building_Blocks_as_Potential_Scavengers_of_Chemical_Carcinogens_A_Computational_Study","335670999_Optimization_of_saponins_phenolics_and_antioxidants_extracted_from_fenugreek_seeds_using_microwave-assisted_extraction_and_response_surface_methodology_as_an_optimizing_tool","305217332_Polyphenols_Extraction_Methods_Antioxidative_Action_Bioavailability_and_Anticarcinogenic_Effects","278160620_Optimization_of_Multigrain_Premix_for_High_Protein_and_Dietary_Fibre_Biscuits_Using_Response_Surface_Methodology_RSM","262975286_Optimisation_of_the_extraction_of_pomegranate_Punica_granatum_husk_phenolics_using_waterethanol_solvent_systems_and_response_surface_methodology","262660699_Phenolic_antioxidants_extraction_from_raspberry_wastes_assisted_by-enzymes","247204844_Antioxidant_activities_of_peel_pulp_and_seed_fractions_of_common_fruits_as_determined_by_FRAP_assay","236460569_Oil_protein_antioxidants_and_free_radical_scavenging_activity_of_stone_from_wild_olive_trees_Olea_europaea_L","230784575_Green_Extraction_of_Natural_Products_Concept_and_Principles","229707135_Analysis_of_condensed_tannins_using_acidified_vanillin","223779511_Evaluation_of_antioxidant_properties_of_pomegranate_pulp_extract","221957551_Optimization_of_phenolics_and_dietary_fibre_extraction_from_date_seeds","51437424_Physico-chemical_properties_and_DPPH-ABTS_scavenging_activity_of_some_local_pomegranate_Punica_granatum_ecotypes","328737670_Antioxidant_potential_and_phenolic_composition_of_extracts_from_Stachys_tmolea_An_endemic_plant_from_Turkey","306932654_Impact_of_instant_controlled_pressure_drop_on_phenolic_compounds_extraction_from_pomegranate_peel","305989943_Optimized_synchronous_extraction_process_of_tea_polyphenols_and_polysaccharides_from_Huaguoshan_Yunwu_tea_and_their_antioxidant_activities","297750541_Optimization_of_Pulsed_Ultrasound-Assisted_Technique_for_Extraction_of_Phenolics_from_Pomegranate_Peel_of_Malas_Variety_Punicalagin_and_Hydroxybenzoic_Acids","283105556_A_process_for_turning_pomegranate_peels_into_a_valuable_food_ingredient_using_ultrasound-assisted_extraction_and_encapsulation","282461070_Extraction_process_Optimization_for_bioactive_compounds_in_pomegranate_peel","280497215_Multi-response_optimization_of_factors_affecting_ultrasonic_assisted_extraction_from_Iranian_basil_using_central_composite_design","264361426_ChemInform_Abstract_The_Principles_of_and_Reasons_for_Using_Water_as_a_Solvent_for_Green_Chemistry","261476923_Green_extraction_processes_of_natural_products_as_tools_for_biorefinery","257562619_Optimization_of_ultrasonic-assisted_extraction_of_pomegranate_Punica_granatum_L_peel_antioxidants_by_response_surface_methodology","249386472_Antioxidants_in_fruits_and_vegetables_-_The_millennium's_health","229723930_Antioxidant_in_fruits_and_vegetables_-_The_millennium's_health","229563004_Optimization_of_Extraction_of_Anthocyanins_from_Black_Currants_with_Aqueous_Ethanol","227936231_Optimization_of_the_Supercritical_Fluid_Extraction_of_Natural_Vitamin_E_from_Wheat_Germ_Using_Response_Surface_Methodology","223729633_Mass_transfer_process_during_extraction_of_phenolic_compounds_from_milled_berries","223679941_Antioxidant_activity_of_some_Algerian_medicinal_plants_extracts_containing_Phenolic_compounds","223633003_Optimisation_of_antioxidant_activity_of_grape_cane_extracts_using_response_surface_methodology","223522204_Antioxidant_and_antimutagenic_activities_of_Pomegranate_peel_extracts","223290534_Comparison_of_antioxidant_capacities_and_cytotoxicities_of_certain_fruit_peels","223158767_Cancer_chemoprevention_and_chemotherapy_Dietary_polyphenols_and_signaling_pathways","51249398_Determination_of_N-methylcarbamate_insecticides_in_water_samples_using_dispersive_liquid-liquid_microextraction_and_HPLC_with_the_aid_of_experimental_design_and_desirability_function","23227448_Response_Surface_Methodology_RSM_as_a_Tool_for_Optimization_in_Analytical_Chemistry","11963851_Inhibition_of_carcinogenesis_by_dietary_polyphenolic_compounds","7348337_Ultrasonic_enhancement_of_the_supercritical_extraction_from_ginger"]}
