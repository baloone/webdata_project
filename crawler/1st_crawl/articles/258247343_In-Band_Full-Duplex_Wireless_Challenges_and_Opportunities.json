{"id":"258247343_In-Band_Full-Duplex_Wireless_Challenges_and_Opportunities","abstract":"In-band full-duplex (IBFD) operation has emerged as an attractive solution\nfor increasing the throughput of wireless communication systems and networks.\nWith IBFD, a wireless terminal is allowed to transmit and receive\nsimultaneously in the same frequency band. This tutorial paper reviews the main\nconcepts about in-band full-duplex wireless .A key challenge behind IBFD\noperation is mitigation of self-interference, i.e., the interference caused by\nan IBFD node's own transmissions to its desired receptions. A wide array of\ntechniques proposed in the literature for IBFD self-interference suppression\nare surveyed in this tutorial. Also discussed are numerous research challenges\nand opportunities in the design and analysis of IBFD wireless systems","authors":["Ashutosh Sabharwal","Philip Schniter","Dongning Guo","Daniel W.
