Privacy is one of the several interests in information that are greatly affected by the Internet. The concept of privacy has come into sharp focus since the mid-20th century because of information-intensive practices supported by rapidly evolving information technologies. At the close of the 20th century, the Internet is having a profound impact on aspects of people lives. It should not be surprising that the Internet's impacts and effects on freedoms, and on concepts underlying laws, are profound as well. Privacy has always been about trade-offs, and information law will involve the formalization of balancing processes between ownership and access and between freedoms to know, to publish, and to express on the one hand, and freedoms to be, to hide, and to deny on the other. The information economy is dependent on trust. Trust must be earned and intrusion-permissive and intrusion-enabling arrangements preclude trust.
