{"id":"342675449_An_Online_Collaborative_Mind_Mapping_Feature_on_Student-Centered_E-Learning_Environment","abstract":"The Faculty of Computer Science of Universitas Indonesia has implemented online learning facilitated by a learning management system called Student-Centered E-Learning Environment (SCeLE). One of its important features is the online discussion board that enables students to construct knowledge collaboratively. Connecting and comparing several ideas in an online discussion forum are challenging for both students and teachers, especially when the discussion runs very fast with long messages. This study proposes an online collaborative mind mapping feature integrated to the discussion forum. A prototype was developed using the Go programming language and Gin web framework. The usability testing was employed to gather data about user experience in using the application. The participants of the study were all students of the Faculty of Computer Science of Universitas Indonesia. The result of the study shows that the application benefits most of the users. The participantsacknowledged that the features help them follow the discussion and it supports the collaborative work. However, in terms of the design and the user experience, more works are required to improve the feature needs","authors":["H Hakim","Harry B.
