{"id":"220617297_Strengths_and_Weakness_of_Quantum_Computing","abstract":"Recently a great deal of attention has focused on quantum computation following a sequence of results [4, 16, 15] suggesting that quantum computers are more powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time o(2 n=2 ). We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class NP \" co--NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time o(2 n=3 ). The former bound is tight since IBM T. J. Watson Research Laboratory, Yorktown Heights, New York, NY 10598, USA. email: bennetc@watson.ibm.com. y 1 Microsoft Way, Redmon...","authors":["Charles H.
