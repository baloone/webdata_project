{"id":"341148305_Constructing_dual-CISTs_of_pancake_graphs_and_performance_assessment_of_protection_routings_on_some_Cayley_networks","abstract":"For a connected graph \\(G=(V,E)\\), two spanning trees \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) of G are said to be a pair of completely independent spanning trees (or a dual-CIST for short) if for any two vertices \\(u,v\\in V\\), the paths joining u and v in the two trees have no common vertex except for u and v. Although the existence of a dual-CIST in the underlying graph of a network has the practical application of protection routing on fault-tolerance, it has been proved that determining whether a graph G admits a dual-CIST is NP-complete. As we know that Cayley graphs are a large family of graphs, some of its subclasses have been attracted and thus graphs in these subclasses have been adopted as the topologies of interconnection networks, such as the n-dimensional star graphs \\(S_n\\), bubble sort graphs \\(BS_n\\), pancake graph \\(P_n\\), alternating group networks \\(AGN_n\\) and so on. Pai and Chang (IEEE/ACM Trans Netw 27(3): 1112â€“1123, 2019) recently showed that there exist dual-CISTs in \\(S_n\\), \\(BS_n\\), \\(AGN_n\\) for \\(n\\geqslant 5\\) and provided their corresponding protection routings. So far, the problem of constructing dual-CISTs on \\(P_n\\) has not been dealt with yet. In this sequel, we continue the investigation of the construction of dual-CISTs in pancake graphs as a complementary result. Since \\(P_n\\), \\(S_n\\), and \\(BS_n\\) are with the same scale, we experimentally assess the performance of protection routing through simulation results for comparing them when \\(n=5,6,7\\).","authors":["Kung-Jui Pai","Ruay-Shiung Chang","Jou-ming Chang"],"meta":["January 2021The Journal of Supercomputing 77(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11227-020-03297-9"],"references":["339455084_A_protection_routing_with_secure_mechanism_in_Mobius_cubes","337698662_Constructing_Two_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Balanced_Hypercubes","337659007_Constructing_dual-CISTs_of_DCell_data_center_networks","337202662_A_well-equalized_3-CIST_partition_of_alternating_group_graphs","334780891_The_Existence_of_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_for_Some_Compound_Graphs","332658388_Dual-CISTs_Configuring_a_Protection_Routing_on_Some_Cayley_Networks","332161048_A_two-stages_tree-searching_algorithm_for_finding_three_completely_independent_spanning_trees","327908036_Improving_the_diameters_of_completely_independent_spanning_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","327128706_Constructing_spanning_trees_in_augmented_cubes","322875066_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_k-th_Power_of_Graphs","321262783_Completely_independent_spanning_trees_for_enhancing_the_robustness_in_ad-hoc_Networks","318222455_Chromatic_Properties_of_the_Pancake_Graphs","317702253_Review_on_single-path_multi-path_routing_protocol_in_manet_A_study","319410102_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_4-Regular_Chordal_Rings","311852252_Constructing_completely_independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes"]}
