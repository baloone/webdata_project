{"id":"348968850_Inventory_Management_Analysis_under_the_System_Dynamics_Model","abstract":"In this work, the modeling of the system dynamics concerning inventory management has been carried out, this was done to achieve a correct analysis on said management, and thus make decisions that benefit the company. Knowing that the problem lies in the mismanagement of inventories, which are managed by certain companies with little or vast knowledge about inventory management, for which, it is desired to make use of the system dynamics modeling, so that this, achieves a correct analysis of the management, but is focused on the dynamics of system. The result obtained, from the development of the methodology applied in this work, was a correct and adequate analysis of the dynamics modeling of system in inventory management, which was achieved, using the simulation software known as Vensim, and a methodology based on three stages that are the Causal Diagram, the Forrester Diagram, and the mathematical equations. © 2021, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.
