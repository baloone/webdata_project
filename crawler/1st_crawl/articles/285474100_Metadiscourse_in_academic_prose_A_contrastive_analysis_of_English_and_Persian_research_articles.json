{"id":"285474100_Metadiscourse_in_academic_prose_A_contrastive_analysis_of_English_and_Persian_research_articles","abstract":"The present study was carried out to compare and contrast the use of metadiscourse elements in\nPersian and English research articles. The research tried to find out how English and Persian made use\nof metadiscourse elements, and whether the two languages differed in using metadiscourse resources\nin academic texts. The corpus used in this study, which was analyzed based on Hyland and Tse (2004)\ntaxonomy, comprised 19 articles and 102,293 words in the two languages, English and Persian. The\nintralingual analysis showed that both Persian and English used interactive resources more than\ninteractional ones, emphasizing the significance of text coherence over interpersonal function of\nlanguage in the academic genre. Compared with English, Persian capitalized on more interactive\nresources, which shows that Persian puts a premium on textuality at the expense of reader\ninvolvement, hence, being comparatively less reader responsible. The results support the interlingual\nrhetorical differences in the use of metadiscourse resources to sustain solidarity with the readers and\nalso to convey the intended propositional message (Mauranen, 2001; Valero-Garces, 1996; Blogojevic,\n2004)","authors":["Gholam Reza Zarei","Sara Mansouri"],"meta":["January 2007The ESP Journal 3(2):24-40"],"references":["270479485_Discoursal_flaws_in_Medical_English_abstracts_A_genre_analysis_per_research-_and_text-type","324306533_An_Introduction_to_Functional_Grammar","321748762_Contrastive_Rhetoric_Cross-Cultural_Aspects_of_Second-Language_Writing","284608523_Metadiscourse_in_academic_prose_a_contrastive_study_of_academic_articles_written_in_English_by_English_and_Norwegian_speakers","274325261_Variation_in_rhetorical_moves_in_grant_proposals_of_US_humanists_and_scientists","249738714_Metadiscourse_in_Persuasive_Writing_A_Study_of_Texts_Written_by_American_and_Finnish_University_Students","248530825_Talking_to_Students_Metadiscourse_in_IntroductoryCoursebooks","247761796_Exploring_Corporate_Rhetoric_Metadiscourse_in_the_CEO's_Letter","242402808_Genres_of_Organizational_Communication_A_Structurational_Approach_to_Studying_Communication_and_Media","239667929_Disciplinary_Discourses_Social_Interactions_in_Academic_Writing"]}
