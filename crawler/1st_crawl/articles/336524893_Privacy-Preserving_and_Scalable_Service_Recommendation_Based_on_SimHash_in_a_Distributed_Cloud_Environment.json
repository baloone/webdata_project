{"id":"336524893_Privacy-Preserving_and_Scalable_Service_Recommendation_Based_on_SimHash_in_a_Distributed_Cloud_Environment","abstract":"With the increasing volume of web services in the cloud environment, Collaborative Filtering- (CF-) based service recommendation has become one of the most effective techniques to alleviate the heavy burden on the service selection decisions of a target user. However, the service recommendation bases, that is, historical service usage data, are often distributed in different cloud platforms. Two challenges are present in such a cross-cloud service recommendation scenario. First, a cloud platform is often not willing to share its data to other cloud platforms due to privacy concerns, which decreases the feasibility of cross-cloud service recommendation severely. Second, the historical service usage data recorded in each cloud platform may update over time, which reduces the recommendation scalability significantly. In view of these two challenges, a novel privacy-preserving and scalable service recommendation approach based on SimHash, named SerRecSimHash , is proposed in this paper. Finally, through a set of experiments deployed on a real distributed service quality dataset WS-DREAM , we validate the feasibility of our proposal in terms of recommendation accuracy and efficiency while guaranteeing privacy-preservation.","authors":["Yanwei Xu","Lianyong Qi","Wanchun Dou","Jiguo Yu"],"meta":["December 2017Complexity 2017(2)","DOI:10.1155/2017/3437854","Project: service ecosystem,service recommendation"],"references":["316079535_Mining_Domain_Knowledge_on_Service_Goals_From_Textual_Service_Descriptions","320689715_Coverless_image_steganography_using_histograms_of_oriented_gradients-based_hashing_algorithm","319637520_Privacy-Preserving_Distributed_Service_Recommendation_Based_on_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing","319115877_Encoding_Multiple_Contextual_Clues_for_Partial-Duplicate_Image_Retrieval","318614050_Enabling_Central_Keyword-Based_Semantic_Extension_Search_Over_Encrypted_Outsourced_Data","318385409_Block_Design-Based_Key_Agreement_for_Group_Data_Sharing_in_Cloud_Computing","316355992_An_Approach_of_Role_Updating_in_Context-Aware_Role_Mining","316076929_Privacy-Preserving_Smart_Semantic_Search_Based_on_Conceptual_Graphs_Over_Encrypted_Outsourced_Data","313541218_Percentile_Performance_Estimation_of_Unreliable_IaaS_Clouds_and_Their_Cost-Optimal_Capacity_Decision","311994602_Effective_and_Efficient_Global_Context_Verification_for_Image_Copy_Detection"]}
