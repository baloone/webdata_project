{"id":"327976985_Virtualization_Framework_for_Cellular_Networks_with_Downlink_Rate_Coverage_Probability_Constraints","abstract":"Wireless network virtualization is emerging as an important technology for next-generation (5G) wireless networks. A key advantage of introducing virtualization in cellular networks is that service providers can robustly share virtualized network resources (e.g., infrastructure and spectrum) to extend coverage, increase capacity, and reduce costs. However, the inherent features of wireless networks, i.e., the uncertainty in user equipment (UE) locations and channel conditions impose significant challenges on virtualization and sharing of the network resources. In this context, we propose a stochastic optimization-based virtualization framework that enables robust sharing of network resources. Our proposed scheme aims at probabilis-tically guaranteeing UEs' Quality of Service (QoS) demand satisfaction, while minimizing the cost for service providers, with reasonable computational complexity and affordable network overhead.","authors":["Shubhajeet Chatterjee","Mohammad J.
