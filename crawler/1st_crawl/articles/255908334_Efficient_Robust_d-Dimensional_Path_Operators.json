{"id":"255908334_Efficient_Robust_d-Dimensional_Path_Operators","abstract":"Path openings and closings are efficient morpholog-ical operators that use flexible oriented paths as structuring ele-ments. They are employed in a similar way to operators with ro-tated line segments as structuring elements, but are more effective at detecting linear structures that are not necessarily locally per-fectly straight. While their theory has always allowed paths in ar-bitrary dimensions, de facto implementations were only proposed in 2D. Recently, a new implementation was proposed enabling the computation of efficient -dimensional path operators. However this implementation is limited in the sense that it is not robust to noise. Indeed, in practical applications, for path operators to be ef-fective, structuring elements must be sufficiently long so that they correspond to the length of the desired features to be detected. Yet, path operators are increasingly sensitive to noise as their length parameter increases. To cope with this limitation, we propose an efficient -dimensional algorithm, the Robust Path Operator, which uses a larger and more flexible family of flexible structuring elements. Given an arbitrary length parameter G, path propaga-tion is allowed if disconnections between two pixels belonging to a path is less or equal to G and so, render it independent of . This simple assumption leads to constant memory bookkeeping and re-sults in a low complexity.","authors":["Fran√ßois Cokelaer","Hugues Talbot","Jocelyn Chanussot"],"meta":["November 2012IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing 6(7)","DOI:10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2213578"],"references":["281183711_Filtering_of_thin_objects_applications_to_vascular_image_analysis","221625013_Segmentation_of_3D_cellular_networks_from_SR-micro-CT_images","221401076_Muliscale_Vessel_Enhancement_Filtering","221249147_3-D_Extraction_of_Fibres_from_Microtomographic_Images_of_Fibre-Reinforced_Composite_Materials","221125634_Direction-Adaptive_Grey-level_Morphology_Application_to_3D_Vascular_Brain_Imaging","220842935_Vessel_Centerline_Tracking_in_CTA_and_MRA_Images_Using_Hough_Transform","220146053_Path_Openings_and_Closings","49673505_Retinal_Image_Analysis_Using_Curvelet_Transform_and_Multistructure_Elements_Morphology_by_Reconstruction","3327391_Segmentation_of_vessel-like_patterns_using_mathematical_morphology_and_curvature_evaluation","3193319_Directional_morphological_filtering","2388170_Multiscale_Vessel_Enhancement_Filtering","260635909_Automatic_Detection_of_Rivers_in_High-Resolution_SAR_Data","243785319_Morphological_Image_Analysis-Principles_and_Applications","227242426_Flexible_Linear_Openings_and_Closings","227117163_Multi-scale_line_segmentation_with_automatic_estimation_of_width_contrast_and_tangential_direction_in_2D_and_3D_medical_images","224147468_Vesselness-guided_variational_segmentation_of_cellular_networks_from_3D_micro-CT","224122254_Constrained_and_Dimensionality-Independent_Path_Openings","222684050_Advanced_directional_mathematical_morphology_for_the_detection_of_the_road_network_in_very_high_resolution_remote_sensing_images","222571721_On_morphological_operators_based_on_rank_filters","222505495_3D_multi_scale_line_filter_for_segmentation_and_visualization_of_curvilinear_structures_in_medical_images","221623696_Fully_automatic_3D_segmentation_of_coronary_arteries_based_on_mathematical_morphology","220610847_Efficient_complete_and_incomplete_path_openings_and_closings","14041038_Improved_vessel_visualization_in_MR_angiography_by_nonlinear_anisotropic_filtering","6631990_Stewart_CV_Retinal_Vessel_Centerline_Extraction_Using_Multiscale_Matched_Filters_Confidence_and_Edge_Measures_IEEE_Transactions_on_Medical_Imaging_2512_1531-1546","4138428_Path-based_morphological_openings","3222077_Erratum_to_Retinal_vessel_centerline_extraction_using_multiscale_matched_filters_confidence_and_edge_measures","3202110_Fuzzy_Fusion_Techniques_for_Linear_Features_Detection_in_Multitemporal_SAR_Images"]}
