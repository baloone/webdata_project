{"id":"344261956_VI-Net_View-Invariant_Quality_of_Human_Movement_Assessment","abstract":"We propose a view-invariant method towards the assessment of the quality of human movements which does not rely on skeleton data. Our end-to-end convolutional neural network consists of two stages, where at first a view-invariant trajectory descriptor for each body joint is generated from RGB images, and then the collection of trajectories for all joints are processed by an adapted, pre-trained 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) (e.g., VGG-19 or ResNeXt-50) to learn the relationship amongst the different body parts and deliver a score for the movement quality. We release the only publicly-available, multi-view, non-skeleton, non-mocap, rehabilitation movement dataset (QMAR), and provide results for both cross-subject and cross-view scenarios on this dataset. We show that VI-Net achieves average rank correlation of 0.66 on cross-subject and 0.65 on unseen views when trained on only two views. We also evaluate the proposed method on the single-view rehabilitation dataset KIMORE and obtain 0.66 rank correlation against a baseline of 0.62.","authors":["Faegheh Sardari","Adeline Paiement","Sion Hannuna","Majid Mirmehdi"],"meta":["September 2020Sensors 20(18)","DOI:10.3390/s20185258"],"references":["351528155_Synthetic_Humans_for_Action_Recognition_from_Unseen_Viewpoints","339559160_Cross_View_Fusion_for_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation","339555823_View-LSTM_Novel-View_Video_Synthesis_Through_View_Decomposition","338564411_A_Deep_Learning_Framework_for_Assessing_Physical_Rehabilitation_Exercises","343466463_VIBE_Video_Inference_for_Human_Body_Pose_and_Shape_Estimation","339562211_TSM_Temporal_Shift_Module_for_Efficient_Video_Understanding","339561828_Learning_to_Reconstruct_3D_Human_Pose_and_Shape_via_Model-Fitting_in_the_Loop","339561787_SlowFast_Networks_for_Video_Recognition","339558533_Action_Assessment_by_Joint_Relation_Graphs","338514623_RepNet_Weakly_Supervised_Training_of_an_Adversarial_Reprojection_Network_for_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation"]}
