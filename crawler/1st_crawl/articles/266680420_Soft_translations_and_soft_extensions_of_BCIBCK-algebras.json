{"id":"266680420_Soft_translations_and_soft_extensions_of_BCIBCK-algebras","abstract":"The concept of soft translations of soft subalgebras and soft ideals over BCI/BCK-algebras is introduced and some related properties are studied. Notions of Soft extensions of soft subalgebras and soft ideals over BCI/BCK-algebras are also initiated. Relationships between soft translations and soft extensions are explored.","authors":["Nazra Sultana","Nazia Rani","Muhammad Irfan Ali","Azhar Hussain"],"meta":["September 2014The Scientific World Journal 2014(1):536709","DOI:10.1155/2014/536709","SourcePubMed"],"references":["268074831_Soft_WS-algebras","265289948_Fuzzy_set_theory_applied_to_implicative_ideals_in_BCK-algebras","264989212_On_Some_Nonclassical_Algebraic_Properties_of_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets","263517059_M_N-Soft_Intersection_BL-Algebras_and_Their_Congruences","320007561_Soft_bckbci-algebras","320006844_Soft_sets_and_soft_rough_sets","320006710_Applications_of_soft_sets_in_ideal_theory_of_BCKBCI-algebras","286685928_Fuzzy_commutative_ideals_in_BCI-algebras","266428291_Commutative_ideals_in_BCK-algebras","265621725_BCK-algebras"]}
