Moreover, it is demonstrated that generalized lower approximation and upper approximation of \\(\\left( \\in ,\\in \\vee q\\right) \\)-fuzzy (subquantale) ideal (prime, semi-prime) are \\(\\left( \\in ,\\in \\vee q\\right) \\)-fuzzy (subquantale) ideal (prime, semi-prime) by set-valued homomorphism, respectively.","authors":["Saqib mazher Qurashi","Muhammad Shabir"],"meta":["September 2018Computational and Applied Mathematics 37(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40314-018-0715-2"],"references":["324041173_Generalized_roughness_in_fuzzy_filters_and_fuzzy_ideals_with_thresholds_in_ordered_semigroups","322549570_Generalized_Rough_Fuzzy_Ideals_in_Quantales","321696927_Rough_prime_bi-G-hyperideals_and_fuzzy_prime_bi-G-hyperideals_of_G-semihypergroups","304104034_A_survey_of_decision_making_methods_based_on_certain_hybrid_soft_set_models","298907793_A_novel_soft_rough_fuzzy_set_Z-soft_rough_fuzzy_ideals_of_hemirings_and_corresponding_decision_making","281732189_A_new_rough_set_theory_Rough_soft_hemirings","265462142_Rough_fuzzy_sets_and_fuzzy_rough_sets","257432188_e_e_V_q-fuzzy_subnear-rings_and_ideals","224708926_Characterizations_of_ordered_semigroups_in_terms_of_q-fuzzy_interior_ideals","220535617_Generalized_Lower_and_Upper_Approximations_in_Quantales","321889578_Generalized_roughness_in_V_q-fuzzy_ideals_of_hemirings","316542679_Roughness_in_non-associative_po-semihypergroups_based_on_pseudohyperorder_relations","315930689_On_a_novel_uncertain_soft_set_model_Z_-soft_fuzzy_rough_set_model_and_corresponding_decision_making_methods","313835753_Applications_of_a_kind_of_novel_Z-soft_fuzzy_rough_ideals_to_hemirings","313192493_Fuzzy_topology_I_Neighbourhood_structures_of_a_fuzzy_point_and_Moore-Smith_convergence","308149165_A_novel_soft_rough_set_Soft_rough_hemirings_and_corresponding_multicriteria_group_decision_making","284001909_Constructive_methods_of_rough_approximation_operators_and_multigranulation_rough_sets","277351901_Topological_representation_of_right-sided_and_idempotent_quantales","266256959_Roughness_of_ideals_in_BCK-algebras","266188640_Ideals_of_quantales","265439069_Rough_groups_and_rough_subgroups","262346426_Roughness_in_quantales","261566015_Roughness_and_fuzziness_in_quantales","257435237_Roughness_in_hemirings","257435071_Rough_ideals_in_lattices","257312830_abab-fuzzy_ideals_of_hemirings","256720882_A_short_note_on_algebraic_T-rough_sets","256410743_Fuzzy_partially_ordered_fuzzy_subgroups","251469417_Algebraic_and_Categorical_Aspects_of_Quantales","242799905_e_e_v_q-fuzzy_subgroup","240266500_Structure_of_rough_sets_and_rough_groups","239064941_Quantales_and_Their_Applications","238237168_Fuzzy_topology_I_Neighborhood_structure_of_a_fuzzy_point_and_Moore-Smith_convergence","236027242_Rough_set_theory_applied_to_lattice_theory","229367096_Generalized_lower_and_upper_approximations_in_a_ring","223713106_Relationship_among_basic_concepts_in_covering-based_rough_sets","222639598_On_the_structure_of_rough_prime_primary_ideals_and_rough_fuzzy_prime_primary_ideals_in_commutative_rings","222461192_Constructive_and_Algebraic_Methods_of_the_Theory_of_Rough_Sets","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","222064417_Roughness_in_rings","221942985_Linear_Logic","220312662_Rough_Ideals_in_Semigroups","220312349_Rough_prime_ideals_and_rough_fuzzy_prime_ideals_in_semigroups","220310911_Roughness_in_modules","220152263_Quantales_finite_observations_and_strong_bisimulation","45455671_Rough_sets_rough_relation_and_rough_functions","45179365_Rough_sets_rough_relations_and_rough_functions","38382881_Quantales_and_Noncommutative_Linear_Logic"]}
