{"id":"282997153_A_Geometric_Method_for_Model_Reduction_of_Biochemical_Networks_with_Polynomial_Rate_Functions","abstract":"Model reduction of biochemical networks relies on the knowledge of slow and\nfast variables. We provide a geometric method, based on the Newton polytope, to\nidentify slow variables of a biochemical network with polynomial rate\nfunctions. The gist of the method is the notion of tropical equilibration that\nprovides approximate descriptions of slow invariant manifolds. Compared to\nextant numerical algorithms such as the intrinsic low dimensional manifold\nmethod, our approach is symbolic and utilizes orders of magnitude instead of\nprecise values of the model parameters. Application of this method to a large\ncollection of biochemical network models supports the idea that the number of\ndynamical variables in minimal models of cell physiology can be small, in spite\nof the large number of molecular regulatory actors.","authors":["Satya Swarup Samal","Dima Grigoriev","Holger Fröhlich","Andreas Günter Weber"],"meta":["October 2015Bulletin of Mathematical Biology 77(12)","DOI:10.1007/s11538-015-0118-0","SourcearXiv","Project: Statistical learning in systems biology"],"references":["281262330_Analysis_of_Reaction_Network_Systems_Using_Tropical_Geometry","273157725_Model_Reduction_of_Biochemical_Reactions_Networks_by_Tropical_Analysis_Methods","259893563_A_Constraint_Solving_Approach_to_Model_Reduction_by_Tropical_Equilibration","306157758_Systems_of_differential_equations_containing_a_small_parameter_multiplying_the_derivative","304782904_Geometry_of_irreversibility_The_Film_of_Nonequilibrium_States","285366318_On_systems_of_differential_equations_containing_parameters","267653497_Dynamic_Dimension_Reduction_in_ODE_Models","260064596_Solving_Systems_of_Polynomial_Equations","256497738_Dynamic_and_Static_Limitation_in_Reaction_Networks_revisited","256088335_Tropicalization_and_tropical_equilibration_of_chemical_reactions"]}
