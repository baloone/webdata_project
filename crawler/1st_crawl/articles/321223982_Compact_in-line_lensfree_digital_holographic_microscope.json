{"id":"321223982_Compact_in-line_lensfree_digital_holographic_microscope","abstract":"Phase imaging brings information about transparent samples such as biological ones. Digital holographic microscopy is a well-known method to visualize transparent samples via the phase information without any staining. Lensfree digital holographic microscopes (DHM) offer the added advantage to provide large field of views (several mm(2) and compared to several hundred μm(2)) and more compact setups that traditional DHM. In this article, a lensfree DHM is presented using a side illumination technique in order to further reduce the device size. Its practical use is described and results on a transparent (phase only) sample are shown.","authors":["Manon Rostykus","Ferréol Soulez","Michael Unser","Christophe Moser"],"meta":["November 2017Methods 136","DOI:10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.11.008"],"references":["313814150_Compact_lensless_phase_imager","309122148_Proximity_Operators_for_Phase_Retrieval","274407198_Synthetic_aperture-based_on-chip_microscopy","318356881_Holographic_Microscope_Slide_in_Spatio-Temporal_Imaging_Modality_for_Reliable_3D_Cell_Counting","318219367_Compact_lensless_off-axis_transmission_digital_holographic_microscope","315830615_Endowing_a_plain_fluidic_chip_with_micro-optics_a_holographic_microscope_slide","306189084_Review_of_quantitative_phase-digital_holographic_microscopy_Promising_novel_imaging_technique_to_resolve_neuronal_network_activity_and_identify_cellular_biomarkers_of_psychiatric_disorders","289131162_Direct_recording_of_holograms_by_a_CCD_target_and_numerical_reconstruction","287446935_Digital_holography_Digital_hologram_recording_numerical_reconstruction_and_related_techniques","277948408_Lensless_phase_microscopy_and_diffraction_tomography_with_multi-angle_and_multi-wavelength_illuminations_using_a_LED_matrix"]}
