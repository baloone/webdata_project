{"id":"334854438_Quantum_Imaginary_Time_Evolution_Quantum_Lanczos_and_Quantum_Thermal_Averaging","abstract":"An efficient way to compute Hamiltonian ground-states on a quantum computer stands to impact many problems in the physical and computer sciences, ranging from quantum simulation to machine learning. Unfortunately, existing techniques, such as phase estimation and variational algorithms, display formal and practical disadvantages, such as requirements for deep circuits and high-dimensional optimization. We describe the quantum imaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, analogs of classical algorithms for ground (and excited) states, but with exponentially reduced space and time requirements per iteration, and without deep circuits, ancillae, or high-dimensional non-linear optimization. We further discuss quantum imaginary time evolution as a natural subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analog of minimally entangled typical thermal states. We implement these algorithms with exact classical emulation as well as in prototype circuits on the Rigetti quantum virtual machine and Aspen-1 quantum processing unit, demonstrating the power of quantum elevations of classical algorithms.","authors":["Mario Motta","Chong Sun","Adrian T.
