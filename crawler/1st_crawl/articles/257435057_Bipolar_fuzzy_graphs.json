{"id":"257435057_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","abstract":"We introduce the concepts of regular and totally regular bipolar fuzzy graphs. We prove necessary and sufficient condition under which regular bipolar fuzzy graph and totally bipolar fuzzy graph are equivalent. We introduce the notion of bipolar fuzzy line graphs and present some of their properties. We state a necessary and sufficient condition for a bipolar fuzzy graph to be isomorphic to its corresponding bipolar fuzzy line graph. We examine when an isomorphism between two bipolar fuzzy graphs follows from an isomorphism of their corresponding bipolar fuzzy line graphs.","authors":["Muhammad Akram","Wieslaw Dudek"],"meta":["December 2011Neural Computing and Applications 21(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-011-0772-6"],"references":["280808335_YinYang_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Sets","319395141_Graph_Theory","313620318_A_first_step_to_a_theory_of_the_intuitionistic_fuzzy_graphs","310837834_Generalized_fuzzy_Lie_subalgebras","287711963_Fuzzy_sets_information_and_control","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","269077101_Comparison_of_interval-valued_fuzzy_sets_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_bipolar-valued_fuzzy_sets","268550632_Fuzzy_graphs","267434282_Cofuzzy_graphs"]}
