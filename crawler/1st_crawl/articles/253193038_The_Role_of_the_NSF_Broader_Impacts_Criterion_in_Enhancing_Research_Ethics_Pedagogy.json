{"id":"253193038_The_Role_of_the_NSF_Broader_Impacts_Criterion_in_Enhancing_Research_Ethics_Pedagogy","abstract":"We analyze the contribution of the NSF Broader Impacts Criterion (BIC) in illuminating the need for broader conception of research ethics in the sciences. This essay advocates augmenting traditional Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) education (procedural ethics) with training regarding broader impacts (extrinsic ethics). We argue that enhancing research ethics training in this way provides a more comprehensive understanding of the ethics relevant to scientific research and prepares scientists to think not only in terms of a responsible science, but also the role of science in responding to identified social needs, namely a responsive science. We believe that including BIC in Research Ethics curriculum taught by science faculty will help to improve practicing scientists' appreciation of BIC and provide a broader conception of the Ethical Dimensions of Scientific Research (EDSR).","authors":["Erich Schienke","Nancy Tuana","Donald Brown","Kenneth J.
