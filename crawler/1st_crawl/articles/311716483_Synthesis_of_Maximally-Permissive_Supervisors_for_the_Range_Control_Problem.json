{"id":"311716483_Synthesis_of_Maximally-Permissive_Supervisors_for_the_Range_Control_Problem","abstract":"We investigate the supervisor synthesis problem for centralized partially-observed discrete event systems subject to safety specifications. It is well known that this problem does not have a unique supremal solution in general. Instead, there may be several incomparable locally maximal solutions. One then needs a mechanism to select one locally maximal solution. Our approach in this paper is to consider a lower bound specification on the controlled behavior, in addition to the upper bound for the safety specification. This leads to a generalized supervisory control problem called the range control problem. While the upper bound captures the (prefix-closed) legal behavior, the lower bound captures the (prefix-closed) minimum required behavior. We provide a synthesis algorithm that solves this problem by effectively constructing a maximally-permissive safe supervisor that contains the required lower bound behavior. This is the first algorithm with such properties, as previous works solve either the maximally-permissive safety problem (with no lower bound), or the lower bound containment problem (without maximal permissiveness).","authors":["Xiang Yin","Stephane Lafortune"],"meta":["August 2017IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 62(8)","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2016.2644867","Project: Analysis and Control of Partially-Observed Discrete-Event Systems"],"references":["308173194_On_the_Maximally-Permissive_Range_Control_Problem_in_Partially-Observed_Discrete_Event_Systems","304456556_On_maximal_permissiveness_in_partially-observed_discrete_event_systems_Verification_and_synthesis","282556740_Synthesis_of_Maximally_Permissive_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","282426709_A_Uniform_Approach_for_Synthesizing_Property-Enforcing_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","251396842_Supervisory_control_of_discrete_event_processes","237092109_Relative_Observability_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_and_Its_Supremal_Sublanguages","288688798_A_General_Approach_for_Synthesis_of_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","279749705_Fault-Tolerant_Control_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_with_Lower-Bound_Specifications","248675924_Verification_and_Control_of_Hybrid_Systems_A_Symbolic_Approach","239374368_Effective_computation_of_an_L_m_G-closed_controllable_and_observable_sublanguage_arising_in_supervisory_control","228981162_Synthesis_with_Incomplete_Informatio","227165048_On_supremal_languages_of_classes_of_sublanguages_that_arise_in_supervisor_synthesis_problems_with_partial_observation","225117659_Nondeterministic_supervision_under_partial_observations","224682826_On_the_Control_of_Discrete_Event_Dynamical_Systems","223743660_Games_for_synthesis_of_controllers_with_partial_observation"]}
