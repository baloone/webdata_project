{"id":"329768992_Interlacing_Families_IV_Bipartite_Ramanujan_Graphs_of_All_Sizes","abstract":"We prove that there exist bipartite Ramanujan graphs of every degree and every number of vertices. The proof is based on an analysis of the expected characteristic polynomial of a union of random perfect matchings and involves three ingredients: (1) a formula for the expected characteristic polynomial of the sum of a regular graph with a random permutation of another regular graph, (2) a proof that this expected polynomial is real-rooted and that the family of polynomials considered in this sum is an interlacing family, and (3) strong bounds on the roots of the expected characteristic polynomial of a union of random perfect matchings, established using the framework of finite free convolutions introduced recently by the authors.
