{"id":"271863712_An_algebraic_study_of_Peterson's_Intermediate_Syllogisms","abstract":"Peterson’s Intermediate Syllogisms, generalizing Aristotelian syllogisms by intermediate quantifiers ‘Many’, ‘Most’ and ‘Almost all’, are studied. It is demonstrated that, by associating certain values V, W and U on standard Łukasiewicz MV-algebra with the first and second premise and the conclusion, respectively, the validity of a corresponding intermediate syllogism is determined by a simple MV-algebra (in-)equation. Possible conservative extensions of Peterson’s system are discussed. Finally it is shown that Peterson’s bivalued intermediate syllogisms can be viewed as fuzzy theories in Pavelka’s fuzzy propositional logic, i.e. a fuzzy version of Peterson’s Intermediate Syllogisms is introduced.","authors":["Esko Turunen"],"meta":["December 2014Soft Computing 18(12):2431-2444","DOI:10.1007/s00500-013-1216-2"],"references":["239290343_The_Equation_That_Couldn't_Be_Solved_How_Mathematical_Genius_Discovered_the_Language_of_Symmetry","236330946_Mathematics_behind_Fuzzy_Logic","324598273_Intermediate_quantities_Logic_linguistics_and_Aristotelian_semantics","313514563_On_a_generalization_of_quantifiers","313071002_A_computational_approach_to_fuzzy_quantifiers_in_natural_languages","270850636_Fuzzy_Model_for_Real-Time_Reservoir_Operation","243659208_On_fuzzy_logic_I","243536680_On_a_generalization_of_quantifiers","239427137_Many-Valued_Similarity_Reasoning_An_Axiomatic_Approach","232322344_Algebraic_Foundations_of_Many-valued_Reasoning"]}
