{"id":"235939803_Hybrid_Online_Education_Identifying_Integration_Models_Using_Adventure_Learning","abstract":"In this paper we sought to understand how teachers chose to integrate a hybrid online educa- tion program in their classrooms, how students responded to this choice, and how students' experiences were influenced by the integration model chosen by the teachers. Data collected via classroom observations, personal interviews, and focus groups suggest four integration models: curriculum-based, activities-based, standards-based, and media-based. We discuss these models in the context of hybrid online education and particularly in adventure learning. Finally, we provide recommendations for the design, development, implementation, and integration of hybrid online education programs.
