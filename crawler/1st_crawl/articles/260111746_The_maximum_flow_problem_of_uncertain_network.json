{"id":"260111746_The_maximum_flow_problem_of_uncertain_network","abstract":"The maximum flow problem is one of the classic combinatorial optimization problems with many applications in electrical power systems, communication networks, computer networks and logistic networks. The goal of the problem is to find the maximum amount of flow from the source to the sink in a network. A network is called uncertain if the arc capacities of the network are uncertain variables. The main purpose of this paper is to solve the maximum flow in an uncertain network by under the framework of uncertainty theory.","authors":["Sheng-Wei Han","Zixiong Peng","Shunqin Wang"],"meta":["May 2014Information Sciences 265:167â€“175","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2013.11.029","Project: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11971286)"],"references":["261667771_A_Sufficient_and_Necessary_Condition_of_Uncertainty_Distribution","318285081_RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS_IN_MAXIMUM_FLOW_ALGORITHMS","292025923_Algorithm_for_solution_of_a_problem_of_maximum_flow_in_a_network_with_power_estimation","288023717_The_Maximum_flow_problem_with_fuzzy_constraints","265425391_Maximal_Flow_Through_a_Network","264665403_Maximum_flow_in_probabilistic_communication_networks","263534091_Recent_Developments_in_Maximum_Flow_Algorithms","257563207_Some_stability_theorems_of_uncertain_differential_equation","257391719_No-arbitrage_determinant_theorems_on_mean-reverting_stock_model_in_uncertain_market","256721020_Cross-entropy_measure_of_uncertain_variables"]}
