{"id":"220713273_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","abstract":"Sesqui-pushout (SqPO) rewriting—“sesqui” means “one and a half” in Latin—is a new algebraic approach to abstract rewriting in any category. SqPO rewriting is a deterministic and conservative extension of double-pushout (dpo) rewriting, which allows to model “deletion in unknown context”, a typical feature of single-pushout (spo) rewriting, as well as cloning.\nAfter illustrating the expressiveness of the proposed approach through a case study modelling an access control system, we discuss sufficient conditions for the existence of final pullback complements and we analyze the relationship between SqPO and the classical dpo and spo approaches.","authors":["Andrea Corradini","Tobias Heindel","Frank Hermann","Barbara König"],"meta":["September 2006","DOI:10.1007/11841883_4","SourceDBLP","Conference: Graph Transformations, Third International Conference, ICGT 2006, Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, September 17-23, 2006, Proceedings"],"references":["223806275_Algebraic_approach_to_single-pushout_graph_transformation","222089845_Protection_in_Operating_Systems","313193607_Role_based_access_control_models","268615024_Studies_in_Logic_and_the_Foundations_of_Mathematics","247800581_The_Categorial_Analysis_of_Logic","242982550_Exponentiable_morphisms_partial_products_and_pullback_complements","242505836_Topoi_the_categorial_analysis_of_logic","232644595_Graph-Grammars_An_Algebraic_Approach","231944303_Parallelism_and_concurrency_in_high-level_replacement_systems","222027571_Categories_of_Partial_Maps"]}
