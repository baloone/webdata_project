{"id":"352550061_Novel_Properties_of_Edge_Irregular_Single_Valued_Neutrosophic_Graphs","abstract":"In this paper, some types of edge irregular single valued neutrosophic graphs such as neighbourly\nedge totally irregular single valued neutrosophic graphs, strongly edge irregular single valued neutrosophic\ngraphs and strongly edge totally irregular single valued neutrosophic graphs are introduced. A comparative\nstudy between neighbourly edge irregular single valued neutrosophic graphs and neighbourly edge totally ir-\nregular single valued neutrosophic graphs is done. Likewise some properties of them are studied. Finally, we\nhave given some interesting results about edge irregular single valued neutrosophic graphs that are very useful\nin computer science and networks.","authors":["Ali Asghar Talebi Rostami","Masoomeh Ghasemi","Hossein Rashmanlou","Broumi Said"],"meta":["June 2021","Project: Generalization of fuzzy graphs"],"references":[]}
