{"id":"221241227_A_Formal_Treatment_of_the_Barendregt_Variable_Convention_in_Rule_Inductions","abstract":"Barendregt's variable convention simplifies many informal proofs in the Î»-calculus by allowing the consideration of only those bound variables that have been suitably chosen. Barendregt does not give a formal justification for the variable convention, which makes it hard to formalise such informal proofs. In this paper we show how a form of the variable convention can be built into the reasoning principles for rule inductions. We give two examples explaining our technique.","authors":["Christian Urban","Michael Norrish"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.1145/1088454.1088458","SourceDBLP","Conference: ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming, Workshop on Mechanized reasoning about languages with variable binding, MERLIN 2005, Tallinn, Estonia, September 30, 2005"],"references":["220607032_Mechanising_l-calculus_using_a_classical_first_order_theory_of_terms_with_permutations","317030503_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science_Preface","250400155_Alpha-Structural_Recursion_and_Induction_Extended_Abstract","247931462_Logic_for_Computer_Science_Foundations_of_Automatic_Theorem_Proving","247590529_Some_type_theory_and_lambda_calculus_formalised","242435377_The_Lambda_Calculus_Its_Syntax_and_Semantics","225225200_Some_Lambda_Calculus_and_Type_Theory_Formalized","221302242_Five_Axioms_of_Alpha-Conversion","220805953_Nominal_techniques_in_IsabelleHOL","220694801_Types_and_Programming_Languages"]}
