{"id":"318046908_Scientometric_indicators_for_Brazilian_research_on_High_Energy_Physics_1983-2013","abstract":"This article presents an analysis of Brazilian research on High Energy Physics (HEP) indexed by Web of Science (WoS) from 1983 to 2013. Scientometric indicators for output, collaboration and impact were used to characterize the field under study. The results show that the Brazilian articles account for 3% of total HEP research worldwide and that the sharp rise in the scientific activity between 2009 and 2013 may have resulted from the consolidation of graduate programs, the increase of the funding and of the international collaboration as well as the implementation of the Rede Nacional de Física de Altas Energias (RENAFAE) in 2008. Our results also indicate that the collaboration patterns in terms of the authors, the institutions and the countries confirm the presence of Brazil in multinational Big Science experiments, which may also explain the prevalence of foreign citing documents (all types), emphasizing the international prestige and visibility of the output of Brazilian scientists. We concluded that the scientometric indicators suggested scientific maturity in the Brazilian HEP community due to its long history of experimental research.","authors":["GONZALO R. ALVAREZ","Samile Andréa de Souza Vanz","Marcia Barbosa"],"meta":["June 2017Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências 89(AHEAD)","DOI:10.1590/0001-3765201720160620"],"references":["328957224_Um_espaco_para_a_ciencia_-_a_formacao_da_comunidade_cientifica_no_Brasil","308709570_Effective_Strategies_for_Increasing_Citation_Frequency","297724410_The_role_of_National_journals_on_the_rise_in_Brazilian_Agricultural_Science_Publications_in_Web_of_Science","289991754_Scholarly_publication_and_collaboration_in_Brazil_The_role_of_geography","269665585_Brazilian_growth_in_the_mainstream_science_The_role_of_human_resources_and_national_journals","262756231_Colaboracao_Cientifica_revisao_teorico_conceitual","262705684_Cooperacao_Internacional_para_o_Desenvolvimento_em_Ciencia_e_Tecnologia_A_Participacao_Brasileira_na_Organizacao_Europeia_para_Pesquisa_Nuclear_CERN","312970191_Scientific_collaboration_networks","270541585_Indicadores_de_desempenho_ciencia_brasileira_e_a_cobertura_das_bases_informacionais","257662687_Response_to_the_comments_on_the_article_Brazil's_growing_production_of_scientific_articles-how_are_we_doing_with_review_articles_and_other_qualitative_indicators"]}
