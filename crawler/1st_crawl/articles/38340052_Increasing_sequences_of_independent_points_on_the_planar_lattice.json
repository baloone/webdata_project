{"id":"38340052_Increasing_sequences_of_independent_points_on_the_planar_lattice","abstract":"In 1977 Vershik and Kerov deduced the asymptotic normalized length of the longest increasing sequence among independent points uniformly distributed on the unit square. We solve the analogous problem for points on the planar square lattice that are present independently of each other.","authors":["Timo Seppäläinen"],"meta":["November 1997The Annals of Applied Probability 7(4)","DOI:10.1214/aoap/1043862416"],"references":["258229129_Limiting_Curves_for_IID_Records","248019111_A_Microscopic_Model_for_the_Burgers_Equation_and_Longest_Increasing_Subsequences","303284903_Asymptotics_of_the_Plancherel_measure_of_the_symmetric_group_and_the_limiting_form_of_Young_tables","277503531_Longest_Common_Subsequences_of_Two_Random_Sequences","243770699_Asymptotics_of_the_Plancherel_measure_of_the_symmetric_group_and_the_limit_form_of_Young_tableaux","239063199_A_few_seedlings_of_research","236736765_The_Ergodic_Theory_of_Subadditive_Stochastic_Processes","225607611_Hammersley's_interacting_particle_process_and_longest_increasing_subsequences","222445529_Shepp_LA_A_variational_problem_for_random_Young_tableaux_Adv_Math26_206-222","38362874_A_Phase_Transition_for_the_Score_in_Matching_Random_Sequences_Allowing_Deletions"]}
