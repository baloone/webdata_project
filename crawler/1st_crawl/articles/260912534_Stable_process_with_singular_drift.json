{"id":"260912534_Stable_process_with_singular_drift","abstract":"Suppose that d >= 2 and a epsilon (1, 2). Let mu = (mu(1) ,..., mu(d)) be such that each mu(i) is a signed measure on belonging to the Kato class Kd,ce_. In this paper, we consider the stochastic differential equation dX, = dSi+dAt, where SI is a symmetric a-stable process on Rd and for each j = 1,,d, the jth component A,1 of AI is a continuous additive functional of finite variation with respect to X whose Revuz measure is p,i. The unique solution for the above stochastic differential equation is called an a-stable process with drift au. We prove the existence and uniqueness, in the weak sense, of such an a-stable process with drift it, and establish sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for such a process.","authors":["Panki Kim","Renming Song"],"meta":["July 2014Stochastic Processes and their Applications 124(7)","DOI:10.1016/j.spa.2014.03.006"],"references":["257028394_Uniqueness_of_Stable_Processes_with_Drift","225949230_Boundary_Harnack_principle_for_Brownian_motions_with_measure-valued_drifts_in_bounded_Lipschitz_domains","51917411_Fractional_Laplacian_with_singular_drift","47797014_Dirichlet_heat_kernel_estimates_for_fractional_Laplacian_with_gradientperturbation","38351761_Brownian_motion_with_singular_drift","303489728_Some_theorems_on_stable_processes","258505506_Geometric_Measure_Theory","255050418_Chapter_3_Modeling_Financial_Security_Returns_Using_Levy_Processes","247590287_Some_Theorems_on_Stable_Processes","246626738_Levy_Processes_and_Stochastic_Calculus","243781761_Geometry_of_Sets_and_Measures_in_Euclidean_Spaces","243113814_Pseudodifferential_Operators_and_Markov_Processes","242961281_On_the_relative_compactness_of_sets_of_probability_measures_inD_0_left_mathfrakX_right","239928088_Two-sided_estimates_on_the_density_of_Brownian_motion_with_singular_drift","237127954_Semimartingale_Theory_and_Stochastic_Calculus","226654330_Feynman-Kac_semigroup_with_discontinuous_additive_functionals","225191292_Time-dependent_gradient_perturbations_of_fractional_Laplacian","225134440_Estimates_of_Heat_Kernel_of_Fractional_Laplacian_Perturbed_by_Gradient_Operators","38362592_Conditional_Distributions_and_Tightness","26406503_Stochastic_differential_equations_with_jumps"]}
