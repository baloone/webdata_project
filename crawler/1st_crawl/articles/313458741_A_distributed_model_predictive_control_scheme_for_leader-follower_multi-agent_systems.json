{"id":"313458741_A_distributed_model_predictive_control_scheme_for_leader-follower_multi-agent_systems","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel receding horizon control scheme for solving the formation problem of leader–follower configurations. The algorithm is based on set-theoretic ideas and is tuned for agents described by linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to input and state constraints. The novelty of the proposed framework relies on the capability to jointly use sequences of one-step controllable sets and polyhedral piecewise state-space partitions in order to online apply the ‘better’ control action in a distributed receding horizon fashion. Moreover, we prove that the design of both robust positively invariant sets and one-step-ahead controllable regions is achieved in a distributed sense. Simulations and numerical comparisons with respect to centralised and local-based strategies are finally performed on a group of mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","authors":["Giuseppe Franzé","Walter Lucia","Francesco Tedesco"],"meta":["February 2017International Journal of Control 91(2):1-14","DOI:10.1080/00207179.2017.1282178"],"references":["305907507_A_set-theoretic_control_architecture_for_constrained_switching_systems","282546882_A_Receding_Horizon_Control_Strategy_for_Autonomous_Vehicles_in_Dynamic_Environments","273398397_Model_predictive_control_for_constrained_networked_systems_subject_to_data_losses","289399809_Smoothing_Techniques-Based_Distributed_Model_Predictive_Control_Algorithms_for_Networks","279799991_The_Explicit_Constrained_Min-Max_Model_Predictive_Control_of_a_Discrete-Time_Linear_System_With_Uncertain_Disturbances","273393344_Protocols_Design_and_Uncontrollable_Topologies_Construction_for_Multi-Agent_Networks","270569713_A_Distributed_Obstacle_Avoidance_MPC_Strategy_for_Leader-Follower_Formations","262566127_A_Distributed_Receding_Horizon_Control_Scheme_for_Leader-Follower_Architectures_A_Set-Theoretic_Approach","261051725_Efficient_interior_point_methods_for_multistage_problems_arising_in_receding_horizon_control","260082643_Set-Theoretic_Methods_in_Control"]}
