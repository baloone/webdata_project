{"id":"32231247_Cognitive_Technologies_for_Mathematics_Education","abstract":"This chapter begins with a sociohistorical perspective on the roles played by cognitive technologies as reorganizers rather than amplifiers of mind. Informed by patterns of the past, perhaps we can better understand the transformational roles of advanced technologies in mathematical thinking and education. Computers are doing far more than making it easier or faster to do what we are already doing. The sociohistorical context may also illuminate promising directions for research and practice on computers in mathematics education and make sense of the drastic reformulations in the aims and methods of mathematics education wrought by computers.","authors":["Roy D.
