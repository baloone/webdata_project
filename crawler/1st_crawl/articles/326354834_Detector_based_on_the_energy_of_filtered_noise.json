{"id":"326354834_Detector_based_on_the_energy_of_filtered_noise","abstract":"This paper deals with the detection of unknown signals in white noise. We present a new detector, based on the difference\nof a deterministic function of the energy of the signal and the energy of the same signal, which has been filtered. Unlike usual energy\ndetector (ED), the proposed detector consists in exploiting the behavior of the energy of filtered white noise, which can be a priori\ndetermined since the used filter is known. Thus, if the measured energy differs from an expected value, the detector decides that a\nsignal is present in the band. In order to have the same asymptotic complexity as ED, a simple two-tap filter is used. The theoretical\nexpressions of the probabilities of detection and false alarm are developed, and the optimal threshold is deduced. Simulations show that\nthe proposed detector achieves better performance than ED, in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels.\nFurthermore, the relevance of the analytical results is proved through simulations.","authors":["Vincent Savaux"],"meta":["July 2018Signal Processing, IET","DOI:10.1049/iet-spr.2018.5099"],"references":["257877068_Ten_Years_of_Research_in_Spectrum_Sensing_and_Sharing_in_Cognitive_Radio","254058255_Spectrum_Sensing_for_Cognitive_Radio_State-Of-The-ART_and_Recent_Advances","235920362_Distribution_discontinuities_detection_using_algebraic_technique_for_spectrum_sensing_in_cognitive_radio","235920360_Spectrum_sensing_for_cognitive_radio_exploiting_spectrum_discontinuities_detection","224328063_Spectrum-Sensing_Algorithms_for_Cognitive_Radio_Based_on_Statistical_Covariances","224265743_Effects_of_Noise_Power_Estimation_on_Energy_Detection_for_Cognitive_Radio_Applications","301981290_Conventional_Energy_Detector","301868553_Cooperative_Spectrum_Sensing_Using_Random_Matrix_Theory","261236861_Theoretical_basics_of_radar_signals_energy_detection","224392604_A_Survey_of_Spectrum_Sensing_Algorithms_for_Cognitive_Radio_Applications"]}
