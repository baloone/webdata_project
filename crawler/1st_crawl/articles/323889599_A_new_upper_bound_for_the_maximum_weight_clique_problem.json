{"id":"323889599_A_new_upper_bound_for_the_maximum_weight_clique_problem","abstract":"The maximum weight clique problem (MWCP) for a vertex-weighted graph is to find a complete subgraph in which the sum of vertex weights is maximum. The main goal of this paper is to develop an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the MWCP. As a crucial aspect of branch-and-bound MWCP algorithms is the incorporation of a tight upper bound, we first define a new upper bound for the MWCP, called UBWC, that is based on a novel notion called weight cover. The idea of a weight cover is to compute a set of independent sets of the graph and define a weight function for each independent set so that the weight of each vertex of the graph is covered by such weight functions. We then propose a new branch-and-bound MWCP algorithm called WC-MWC that uses UBWC to reduce the number of branches of the search space that must be traversed by incrementally constructing a weight cover for the graph. Finally, we present experimental results that show that UBWC reduces the search space much more than previous upper bounds, and the new algorithm WC-MWC outperforms some of the best performing exact and heuristic MWCP algorithms on both small/medium graphs and real-world massive graphs.","authors":["Chu-Min Li","Yanli Liu","Hua Jiang","Felip Many√†"],"meta":["March 2018European Journal of Operational Research 270(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2018.03.020","Project: Exact Algorithms for The Maximum Weight Clique Problem"],"references":["305821765_PUSH_a_Generalized_Operator_for_the_Maximum_Vertex_Weight_Clique_Problem","304128682_Two_efficient_local_search_algorithms_for_maximum_weight_clique_problem","278716368_A_review_on_algorithms_for_maximum_clique_problems","266859824_An_improved_branch_and_bound_algorithm_for_the_maximum_clique_problem","265295850_Solving_the_winner_determination_problem_via_a_weighted_maximum_clique_heuristic","258933811_Increasing_Coding_Opportunities_Using_Maximum-_Weight_Clique","249863827_Combinatorial_Branch-and-Bound_for_the_Maximum_Weight_Independent_Set_Problem","235696204_An_improved_bit_parallel_exact_maximum_clique_algorithm","221605081_Predicting_Structural_and_Functional_Sites_in_Proteins_by_Searching_for_Maximum-weight_Cliques","321137237_The_Network_Data_Repository_with_Interactive_Graph_Analytics_and_Visualization","320827523_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Weight_Clique_Problem_in_Large_Graphs","320827517_Combining_Efficient_Preprocessing_and_Incremental_MaxSAT_Reasoning_for_MaxClique_in_Large_Graphs","314033019_On_Minimization_of_the_Number_of_Branches_in_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","301727884_An_Exact_Algorithm_Based_on_MaxSAT_Reasoning_for_the_Maximum_Weight_Clique_Problem","300882879_Incremental_MaxSAT_Reasoning_to_Reduce_Branches_in_a_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_for_MaxClique","289769438_Video_Object_Co-segmentation_by_Regulated_Maximum_Weight_Cliques","280979699_A_new_exact_maximum_clique_algorithm_for_large_and_massive_sparse_graphs","280025380_Infra-chromatic_bound_for_exact_maximum_clique_search","258382175_Relaxed_approximate_coloring_in_exact_maximum_clique_search","257786613_Maximum-Weight_Stable_Sets_and_Safe_Lower_Bounds_For_Graph_Coloring","256660322_Optimizing_with_Minimum_Satisfiability","222569087_Clique-detection_models_in_computational_biochemistry_and_genomics","221604907_An_Efficient_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_Based_on_MaxSAT_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","221013447_A_Simple_and_Faster_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Clique","220617530_Addendum_Minimum_Weighted_Coloring_of_Triangulated_Graphs_with_Application_to_Maximum_Weight_Vertex_Packing_and_Clique_Finding_in_Arbitrary_Graphs"]}
