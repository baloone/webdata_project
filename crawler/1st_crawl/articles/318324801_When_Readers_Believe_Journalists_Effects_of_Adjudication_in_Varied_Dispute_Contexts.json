{"id":"318324801_When_Readers_Believe_Journalists_Effects_of_Adjudication_in_Varied_Dispute_Contexts","abstract":"Journalists are often criticized for passive reporting of factual disputes in politics, but researchers have only recently begun exploring conditions in which they may successfully influence readers’ beliefs — scenarios less likely to produce partisan bias. Intra-party disputes and those which are polarized, but not contentious, may be two alignments of elite cues that vitiate motivated reasoning and allow for influential adjudication. This experiment (N = 523) used a 2 (one-sided adjudication/none) X 2 (intra-party/polarized dispute) design to test this hypothesis. In both cases, adjudication’s effects on factual beliefs were not conditional on ideological or partisan cues. Adjudication did not increase perceived bias, and increased satisfaction of readers’ informational needs.","authors":["Benjamin Lyons"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Public Opinion Research Forthcoming(4)","DOI:10.1093/ijpor/edx013"],"references":["317325837_Intraparty_Hostility_Social_Identity_Sub-Identity_and_the_Hostile_Media_Effect_in_a_Contested_Primary","314246867_Ideological_Heterogeneity_and_the_Rise_of_Donald_Trump","314124684_Partisan_Selective_Sharing_The_Biased_Diffusion_of_Fact-Checking_Messages_on_Social_Media_Sharing_Fact-Checking_Messages_on_Social_Media","351449820_Deciding_What's_True_The_Rise_of_Political_Fact-Checking_in_American_Journalism","344550448_The_Nature_and_Origins_of_Mass_Opinion","335754166_Partisan_Hearts_and_Minds","332085187_Social_Cognition_Making_Sense_of_People","318666185_Electoral_Incongruence_and_Delayed_Republican_Gains_in_Southern_State_Legislatures","318008588_The_Elusive_Backfire_Effect_Mass_Attitudes'_Steadfast_Factual_Adherence","313222363_Parties_in_state_politics"]}
