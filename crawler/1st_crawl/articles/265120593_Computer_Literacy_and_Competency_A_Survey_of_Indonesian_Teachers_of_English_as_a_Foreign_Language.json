{"id":"265120593_Computer_Literacy_and_Competency_A_Survey_of_Indonesian_Teachers_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language","abstract":"This article presents the results of a study, which examined the current level of computer literacy of a group of Indonesian teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL) and investigated factors affecting their use of computers in classrooms. Participants in the study were in-service teachers of EFL at Indonesian schools and universities. The teachers were invited to respond to a questionnaire containing questions related to the teachers' ownership and accessibility of computers, their level of ability to perform computer-based tasks, their personal and professional use of computers and their interest in computer-assisted language learning (CALL). The findings of the study provide a picture of the Indonesian teachers' use of computers in their local contexts and recommend increasing the teachers' online opportunities, skills and competencies in the use of computers for their teaching practices and professional development.","authors":["Jeong-Bae Son","Thomas Robb"],"meta":["November 2010CALL-EJ 12(1)"],"references":["344134795_EFL_teachers'_perceptions_and_perspectives_on_Internet-assisted_language_teaching","343441267_Teacher_development_in_e-learning_environments","331402593_The_Role_of_Computer-Supported_Discussion_for_Language_Teacher_Education_What_Do_the_Students_Say","304845008_The_Future_of_Teacher_Education","300977752_20_Helping_teachers_to_help_themselves","261951270_Experimental_Effects_Of_Online_Instruction_On_K-12_Teachers'_Concerns_About_Technology_Integration","255566811_Measuring_Knowledge_of_Technology_Usage_and_Stages_of_Concern_About_Computing_A_Study_of_Middle_School_Teachers","251218534_Preservice_Teachers'_Perceptions_of_an_Introductory_Instructional_Technology_Course","250196532_Technophilia_vs_Technophobia_A_Preliminary_Look_at_Why_Second-Language_Teachers_Do_or_Do_Not_Use_Technology_in_Their_Classrooms","249041055_Teacher_education_in_CALL_Teaching_teachers_to_educate_themselves"]}
