{"id":"236248485_Three_Generalizations_of_the_FOCUS_Constraint","abstract":"The FOCUS constraint expresses the notion that solutions are concentrated. In\npractice, this constraint suffers from the rigidity of its semantics. To tackle\nthis issue, we propose three generalizations of the FOCUS constraint. We\nprovide for each one a complete filtering algorithm as well as discussing\ndecompositions.","authors":["Nina Narodytska","Thierry Petit","Mohamed Siala","Toby Walsh"],"meta":["October 2016Constraints 21(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10601-015-9233-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262220459_Minimization_of_the_number_of_breaks_in_sports_scheduling_problems_using_constraint_programming","230669011_Focus_A_Constraint_for_Concentrating_High_Costs","221632726_SPREAD_a_balancing_constraint_based_on_statistics","316516774_Minimization_of_the_number_of_breaks_in_sports_scheduling_problems_using_constraint_programming","313721982_A_filtering_algorithm_for_constraints_of_difference_in_CSPs","263901318_THE_ORDERED_DISTRIBUTE_CONSTRAINT","242930548_Optimal_Capacity_Scheduling--II","238836296_Optimal_Capacity_Scheduling_II","221633539_A_Filtering_Algorithm_for_the_Stretch_Constraint","221633333_A_Regular_Language_Membership_Constraint_for_Finite_Sequences_of_Variables"]}
