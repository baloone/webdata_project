{"id":"296787642_Philosophy_of_Technology_and_Engineering_Sciences","abstract":"The Handbook Philosophy of Technology and Engineering Sciences addresses numerous issues in the emerging field of the philosophy of those sciences that are involved in the technological process of designing, developing and making of new technical artifacts and systems. These issues include the nature of design, of technological knowledge, and of technical artifacts, as well as the toolbox of engineers. Most of these have thus far not been analyzed in general philosophy of science, which has traditionally but inadequately regarded technology as mere applied science and focused on physics, biology, mathematics and the social sciences. . First comprehensive philosophical handbook on technology and the engineering sciences . Unparalleled in scope including explorative articles . In depth discussion of technical artifacts and their ontology . Provides extensive analysis of the nature of engineering design . Focuses in detail on the role of models in technology.","authors":["Dov Gabbay","Paul Thagard","John Woods","Anthonie Meijers"],"meta":["January 2009","Project: philosophy of science"],"references":[]}
