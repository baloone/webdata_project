{"id":"327399397_Information_System_Quality_Managers_Perspective","abstract":"To evaluate Information System Quality (ISQ) quantitatively, a model was constructed based on sub-models related to the five Information System (IS) components, namely, Human Resources, Hardware, Software and application, Procedure and Data, and all IS players perspectives are considered who are: Managers, Technical Staff, Functional Staff and Users. This paper focuses on the survey designed for managers in order to form the variable indicators from variable questions, via appropriate formulas in the first place, and to analyze data collected from IS managers of the Moroccan universities in the second one. This approach will allow diagnosing precisely the malfunctioning areas on ISQ by emphasizing on the components with less quality level. It will also enable making comparison of ISQ on different organizations with the mean of standardized values.
