{"id":"282844430_Wavelet_Frame_Based_Image_Restoration_Using_Sparsity_Nonlocal_and_Support_Prior_of_Frame_Coefficients","abstract":"The wavelet frame systems have been widely investigated and applied for image\nrestoration and many other image processing problems over the past decades,\nattributing to their good capability of sparsely approximating piece-wise\nsmooth functions such as images. Most wavelet frame based models exploit the\n$l_1$ norm of frame coefficients for a sparsity constraint in the past. The\nauthors in \\cite{ZhangY2013, Dong2013} proposed an $l_0$ minimization model,\nwhere the $l_0$ norm of wavelet frame coefficients is penalized instead, and\nhave demonstrated that significant improvements can be achieved compared to the\ncommonly used $l_1$ minimization model. Very recently, the authors in\n\\cite{Chen2015} proposed $l_0$-$l_2$ minimization model, where the nonlocal\nprior of frame coefficients is incorporated. This model proved to outperform\nthe single $l_0$ minimization based model in terms of better recovered image\nquality. In this paper, we propose a truncated $l_0$-$l_2$ minimization model\nwhich combines sparsity, nonlocal and support prior of the frame coefficients.\nThe extensive experiments have shown that the recovery results from the\nproposed regularization method performs better than existing state-of-the-art\nwavelet frame based methods, in terms of edge enhancement and texture\npreserving performance.","authors":["Liangtian He","Yilun Wang"],"meta":["February 2019The Visual Computer","DOI:10.1007/s00371-017-1440-3","SourcearXiv","Project: Image Enhancement and Image Restoration"],"references":["329464084_Iterative_Support_Detection-Based_Split_Bregman_Method_for_Wavelet_Frame-Based_Image_Inpainting","315044938_Poisson_noise_removal_of_images_on_graphs_using_tight_wavelet_frames","304341487_Directional_Frames_for_Image_Recovery_Multi-scale_Discrete_Gabor_Frames","303830436_Denoising_of_natural_images_through_robust_wavelet_thresholding_and_genetic_programming","303600289_Data-Driven_Tight_Frame_Learning_Scheme_Based_on_Local_and_Non-local_Sparsity_with_Application_to_Image_Recovery","313419383_Sparsity-based_image_denoising_via_dictionary_learning_and_structural_clustering","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","301837261_Support_Driven_Wavelet_Frame-based_Image_Deblurring","301659480_Data-driven_tight_frame_learning_scheme_based_on_local_and_non-local_sparsity_with_application_to_image_recovery","292741720_The_split_Bregman_algorithm_for_L1_regularized_problems"]}
