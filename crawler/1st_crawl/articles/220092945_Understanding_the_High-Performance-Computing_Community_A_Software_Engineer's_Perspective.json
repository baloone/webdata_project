{"id":"220092945_Understanding_the_High-Performance-Computing_Community_A_Software_Engineer's_Perspective","abstract":"Studies of computational scientists developing software for high-performance computing systems indicate that these scientists face unique software engineering issues. Previous failed attempts to transfer SE technologies to this domain haven't always taken these issues into account. To support scientific-software development, the SE community can disseminate appropriate practices and processes, develop educational materials specifically for computational scientists, and investigate the large-scale reuse of development frameworks.","authors":["Victor R.
