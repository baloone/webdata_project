{"id":"346153566_Semi-automatic_segmentation_of_whole-body_images_in_longitudinal_studies","abstract":"We propose a semi-automatic segmentation pipeline designed for longitudinal studies considering structures with large anatomical variability, where expert interactions are required for relevant segmentations. Our pipeline builds on the regularized Fast Marching (rFM) segmentation approach by Risseret al(2018). It consists in transporting baseline multi-label FM seeds on follow-up images, selecting the relevant ones and finally performing the rFM approach. It showed increased, robust and faster results compared to clinical manual segmentation. Our method was evaluated on 3D synthetic images and patients' whole-body MRI. It allowed a robust and flexible handling of organs longitudinal deformations while considerably reducing manual interventions.","authors":["Elo√Øse Grossiord","Laurent Risser","Trouillard Thomas","Salim Kanoun"],"meta":["November 2020Biomedical Physics & Engineering Express 7(1)","DOI:10.1088/2057-1976/abce16"],"references":["332837521_Automated_segmentation_of_changes_in_FLAIR-hyperintense_white_matter_lesions_in_multiple_sclerosis_on_serial_magnetic_resonance_imaging","332038278_Integrating_Spatial_Configuration_into_Heatmap_Regression_Based_CNNs_for_Landmark_Localization","336396758_Learning_Cross-Modal_Deep_Representations_for_Multi-Modal_MR_Image_Segmentation","336379950_X-Net_Brain_Stroke_Lesion_Segmentation_Based_on_Depthwise_Separable_Convolution_and_Long-Range_Dependencies","336379408_CLCI-Net_Cross-Level_Fusion_and_Context_Inference_Networks_for_Lesion_Segmentation_of_Chronic_Stroke","335675228_D-UNet_A_Dimension-Fusion_U_Shape_Network_for_Chronic_Stroke_Lesion_Segmentation","327995392_Semantic_Organ_Segmentation_in_3D_Whole-Body_MR_Images","327675169_Small_Organ_Segmentation_in_Whole-Body_MRI_Using_a_Two-Stage_FCN_and_Weighting_Schemes_9th_International_Workshop_MLMI_2018_Held_in_Conjunction_with_MICCAI_2018_Granada_Spain_September_16_2018_Proceed","326024903_Keypoint_Transfer_for_Fast_Whole-Body_Segmentation","325515900_Regularized_multi-label_fast_marching_and_application_to_whole-body_image_segmentation","324876560_Multidimensional_co-segmentation_of_longitudinal_brain_MRI_ensembles_in_the_presence_of_a_neurodegenerative_process","323678028_Patient-specific_and_global_convolutional_neural_networks_for_robust_automatic_liver_tumor_delineation_in_follow-up_CT_studies","318779298_Fully_automatic_multiorgan_segmentation_in_normal_whole_body_magnetic_resonance_imaging_MRI_using_classification_forests_CFS_convolutional_neural_networks_CNNs_and_a_multi-atlas_MA_approach","312804051_Soft_Multi-organ_Shape_Models_via_Generalized_PCA_A_General_Framework","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation"]}
