{"id":"327277063_New_insights_into_phylogeography_of_worldwide_Brucella_canis_isolates_by_comparative_genomics-based_approaches_Focus_on_Brazil","abstract":"Background: \nCanine brucellosis, due to Brucella canis, is a worldwide zoonosis that remains endemic in South America, including Brazil. Implementation of powerful whole-genome sequencing approaches allowed exploring the Brucella genus considered as monomorphic, with, to date, more than 500 genomes available in public databases. Nevertheless, with under-representation of B. canis genomes -only twenty complete or draft genomes-, lack of knowledge about this species is still considerable. This report describes a comparative genomics-based phylogeographic investigation of 53 B. canis strains, including 28 isolates paired-end sequenced in this work.\n\nResults: \nObtained results allow identifying a SNP panel species-specific to B. canis of 1086 nucleotides. In addition, high-resolution analyses assess the epidemiological relationship between worldwide isolates. Our findings show worldwide strains are distributed among 2 distinct lineages. One of them seems to be specific to South American strains, including Brazil. B. canis South American strains may be identified by a SNP panel of 15 nucleotides, whereas a 22 SNP panel is sufficient to define contamination origin from Brazil. These results lead to the proposal of a possible spread route for dog brucellosis through South America. Additionally, whole-genome analyses highlight the remarkable genomic stability of B. canis strains over time and the sustainability of the infection in SÃ£o Paulo over 12 year-period.\n\nConclusions: \nSignificant increase of B. canis genomes available in public databases provides new insights into B. canis infection in South America, including Brazil, as well as in the world, and also offers new perspectives for the Brucella genus largo sensu.","authors":["Acacia Ferreira Vicente","Guillaume Girault","Yannick Corde","Mateus Mioni"],"meta":["August 2018BMC Genomics 19(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12864-018-5001-6"],"references":["313947256_Genome_Sequences_of_Three_Brucella_canis_Strains_Isolated_from_Humans_and_a_Dog","308725593_A_Brucella_spp_Isolate_from_a_Pac-Man_Frog_Ceratophrys_ornata_Reveals_Characteristics_Departing_from_Classical_Brucellae","272355487_Full_genome_SNP-based_phylogenetic_analysis_reveals_the_origin_and_global_spread_of_Brucella_melitensis","265965371_Brucella_papii_sp_nov_isolated_from_baboons_Papio_spp","265863579_Whole-Genome_Sequences_of_24_Brucella_Strains","315065380_Brucella_canis_infection_in_dogs_from_commercial_breeding_kennels_in_Brazil","311605360_Techniques_for_the_Brucellosis_Laboratory","301307474_A_genome-wide_SNP-based_phylogenetic_analysis_distinguishes_different_biovars_of_Brucella_suis","299417679_Brucella_vulpis_sp_Nov_isolated_from_mandibular_lymph_nodes_of_red_foxes_vulpes_vulpes","274261449_Comparison_of_Brucella_canis_genomes_isolated_from_different_countries_shows_multiple_variable_regions","264056788_Whole-Genome_Sequence_of_Brucella_canis_Strain_SVA13_Isolated_from_an_Infected_Dog","233396565_Complete_Genome_Sequence_of_Brucella_canis_BCB018_a_Strain_Isolated_from_a_Human_Patient","233396554_Complete_Genome_Sequence_of_Brucella_canis_Strain_118_a_Strain_Isolated_from_Canine","232738832_First_detection_of_Brucella_canis_infections_in_a_breeding_kennel_in_Austria","248382612_Molecular_characterisation_of_Brucella_species"]}
