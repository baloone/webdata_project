{"id":"313392765_A_study_on_driver_fatigue_notification_systems","abstract":"This paper is an introduction to our research which aims to develop a driver safety assistant system using an in vehicle video camera. It is a real-time recognition system which uses vision sensors to detect passengers and driver fatigue conditions. The system assesses the ability of conducting safe driving and notifies the driver for any dangerous situation. Moreover, safety actions are to be performed by an embedded vehicle controlling system. This review paper is to assess the current status of research.","authors":["Mohammed Hayyan Alsibai","Sulastri Abdul Manap"],"meta":["January 2016","Project:  Investigation of a Mathematical Model to Assess Traffic Risk based on Human Reactions in Fatigue Cases and Vehicle Dynamics to Enhance Safety"],"references":["350876539_1_A_survey_of_risk_of_accidents_in_Malaysia_REAAA2013","261432175_Drowsiness_monitoring_based_on_driver_and_driving_data_fusion","313189122_Active_facial_tracking_for_fatigue_detection","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","288123392_Improvements_of_driver_fatigue_detection_system_based_on_eye_tracking_and_dynamic_template_matching","287689752_Multi-Sensor_Soft-Computing_System_for_Driver_Drowsiness_Detection","284027132_A_probabilistic_framework_for_modeling_and_real-time_monitoring_human_fatigue","261121555_A_facial_expression_based_continuous_emotional_state_monitoring_system_with_GPU_acceleration","251995647_Eye_tracking_based_driver_fatigue_monitoring_and_warning_system","246866457_Monitoring_driver_drowsiness_and_stress_in_a_driving_simulator"]}
