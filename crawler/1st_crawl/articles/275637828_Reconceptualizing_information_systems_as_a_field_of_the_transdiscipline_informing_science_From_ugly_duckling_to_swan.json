{"id":"275637828_Reconceptualizing_information_systems_as_a_field_of_the_transdiscipline_informing_science_From_ugly_duckling_to_swan","abstract":"The field of Information Systems (IS) has been attacked for its lack of tradition and focus. This paper suggests that the criticisms are based on the misunderstandings of the nature of Information Systems, both inside and outside the field. The paper begins by extending the fragmentation problem seen by Information Systems to the hierarchical model for knowledge expounded by the universities. It then examines the limitations of existing frameworks for defining IS, and introduces an evolutionary approach. This paper reconceptualizes Information Systems and demonstrates that it has evolved to be part of an emerging discipline of fields, Informing Science.","authors":["Eli B.
