{"id":"317783435_IC-FNN_A_Novel_Fuzzy_Neural_Network_with_Interpretable_Intuitive_and_Correlated-Contours_Fuzzy_Rules_for_Function_Approximation","abstract":"In this paper, a novel Fuzzy Neural Network with Intuitive, Interpretable Correlated-Contours fuzzy rules (IC-FNN), for function approximation, is presented. The surfaces of these fuzzy rules are similar to the surfaces of the hills in the function landscape. Contours of the hills could be correlated and non-separable with different shapes and directions. Thus, to obtain non-separable and correlated fuzzy rules, a proper optimization problem is introduced and solved. To form contours with different shapes, a novel shapeable membership function with an adaptive shape is introduced to define the fuzzy sets. Next, based on hierarchical Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning method, the parameters of the extracted fuzzy rules are fine-tuned. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in real-world regression and time-series prediction problems, and compared with other existing methods. According to these experiments, the proposed method could construct more parsimonious structures with higher accuracy, in comparison to the existing methods. Although the performance of the proposed method for complex and correlated functions is premier, for simple and uncorrelated cases, is appropriate but with a more complex structure.","authors":["Mohammad Mehdi Ebadzadeh","Armin Salimi-Badr"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2718497","Project: Fuzzy Neural
