{"id":"318328127_Optimization_of_natural_frequencies_of_a_plate_structure_by_modifying_boundary_conditions","abstract":"A combined approach based on finite element method and genetic algorithm (FEM-GA) is proposed for optimizing the natural frequencies of plate structures. This approach can identify the optimal boundary conditions so that the plate's natural frequencies can be adjusted simultaneously to their corresponding target values. In this approach, the natural frequencies of plates with arbitrary boundary conditions are calculated by FEM, while GA is employed for searching the optimal solutions of the multiple-objective optimization problem. The FEM is validated by comparing with previous results. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical examples. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.","authors":["Dayi Ou","Cheuk Ming Mak"],"meta":["July 2017The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 142(1):EL56-EL62","DOI:10.1121/1.4991356"],"references":["277944291_Effect_of_Vibration_Properties_of_a_Resonance_Board_on_Piano_Timbre","265862457_Minimizing_the_transient_vibroacoustic_response_of_a_window_to_sonic_booms_by_using_stiffeners_L","262256585_Strategic_Fire_and_Rescue_Service_decision_making_using_evolutionary_algorithms","257634738_Constrained_thickness_optimization_of_rectangular_orthotropic_fiber-reinforced_plate_for_fundamental_frequency_maximization","222863313_Vibration_analysis_of_rectangular_plates_with_general_elastic_boundary_supports","301798664_Point_mass_identification_in_rectangular_plates_from_minimal_natural_frequency_data","266732233_Concepts_and_Applications_of_Finite_Element_Analysis","265513073_Enhancing_low_frequency_sound_absorption_of_micro-perforated_panel_absorbers_by_using_mechanical_impedance_plates","232064314_Design_of_an_acoustic_metamaterial_lens_using_genetic_algorithms","222078281_An_exact_series_solution_for_the_transverse_vibration_of_rectangular_plates_with_general_elastic_boundary_supports"]}
