{"id":"266001922_-Frames_in_Hilbert_C_-modules","abstract":"Certain facts about frames are extended for the new frames in Hilbert C * -modules where they are called *-frames. It is shown that *-frames for Hilbert C * -modules share several useful properties with frames for Hilbert C * -modules. The paper studies also the operators associated to a given *-frame, *-frames for Hilbert C * -modules over commutative unitary C * -algebras, and the construction of new *-frames. The relations between frames and *-frames in Hilbert C * -modules are considered. Moreover, *-frames in Hilbert C * -modules over different C * -algebras are compared, and some characterizations of *-frames in a Hilbert C * -module with respect to another Hilbert C * -module are presented. Finally, dual *-frames are characterized.","authors":["Azadeh Alijani","Mohammad Ali Dehghan"],"meta":["January 2011UPB Scientific Bulletin, Series A: Applied Mathematics and Physics 73(4)"],"references":["265436146_Frames_in_Hilbert_C_-modules_and_C_-algebras","252340981_Painless_Nonorthogonal_Expansions","228568538_Generalized_frames_in_Hilbert_spaces","225180017_Frames_and_bases_in_tensor_products_of_Hilbert_spaces_and_Hilbert_C-modules","254468740_Hilbert_C-modules_in_which_all_closed_submodules_are_complemented","245592853_C-algebras_and_operator_theory","244998661_A_Primer_on_Spectral_Theory","243766069_Fundamentals_of_the_Theory_of_Operator_Algebras_I","243765341_A_Course_in_Abstract_Harmonic_Analysis","243066264_Portraits_of_Frames"]}
