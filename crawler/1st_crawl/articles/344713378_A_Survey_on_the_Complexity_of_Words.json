{"id":"344713378_A_Survey_on_the_Complexity_of_Words","abstract":"This paper deals with the complexity of words (number of its distinct subwords), which play an important role in biology (nucleotide sequences), information theory and computer science. The new results are in Propositions 1-2 and in Lemma. A conjecture on the complexity of superstrings is stated. An old conjecture on frequency of words with some complexities is discussed again.","authors":["Zoltan Kasa"],"meta":["October 2020"],"references":[]}
