{"id":"2832779_Legal_Knowledge_Based_Systems","abstract":"this paper I argue that the applicability of the technology is very limited, because it presupposes that such a question has some legal facts (a set of applicable rules, or cases) as its answer. It has not. Answering legal questions-also called legal information serving- involves making inferences about the world and about the structure of a regulation, as can be shown by analysing these questions. Legal information serving is more complex than typical problem solving, because no fixed, domain-independent methods appear to be used. However, in a legal reasoning architecture where reasoning about the world is not mixed with reasoning about applying the regulations, a non-combinatorial, tractable solution can be found. This is the more so, when reasoning about the world can be limited to its superficial, terminological structures","authors":["C. A. F. M. Grtters","Joost Breuker","H. Jaap Van Den Herik","A. H. J.
