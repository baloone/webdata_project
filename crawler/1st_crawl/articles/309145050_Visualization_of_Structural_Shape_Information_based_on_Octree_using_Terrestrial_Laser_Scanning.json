{"id":"309145050_Visualization_of_Structural_Shape_Information_based_on_Octree_using_Terrestrial_Laser_Scanning","abstract":"This study presents the visualization of shape information based on Octree using 3D laser scanning. The process of visualization was established to construct the Octree structure from the 3D scan data. The scan data was converted to a 2D surface through the mesh technique and the surface was then converted to a 3D object through the Raster/Vector transformation. The 3D object was transmitted to the Octree Root Node and The shape information was constructed by the recursive partitioning of the Octree Root Node. The test-bed was selected as the steel bridge structure in Sungkyunkwan University. The shape information based on Octree was condensed into 89.3%. In addition, the Octree compressibility was confirmed to compare the shape information of the office building, a computer science campus in Germany and a New College in USA. The basis is created by the visualization of shape information for double-deck tunnel and it will be expected to improve the efficiency of structural health monitoring and maintenance.","authors":["Gichun Cha","Donghwan Lee","Seunghee Park"],"meta":["August 2016Journal of the Korea Academia-Industrial cooperation Society 17(8):8-16","DOI:10.5762/KAIS.2016.17.8.8"],"references":["264141161_A_Comparison_of_3D_R-tree_and_Octree_to_Index_Large_Point_Clouds_from_a_3D_Terrestrial_Laser_Scanner","263993933_Massive_3D_Point_Cloud_Visualization_by_Generating_Artificial_Center_Points_from_Multi-Resolution_Cube_Grid_Structure","283201965_A_Terrestrial_LiDAR_Based_Method_for_Detecting_Structural_Deterioration_and_Its_Application_to_Tunnel_Maintenance","273568437_Implementation_of_File-referring_Octree_for_Huge_3D_Point_Clouds","264175654_3D_building_modeling_using_aerial_LiDAR_data","264026145_Compression_of_Normal_Vectors_using_Octree_Encoding","258791308_One_billion_points_in_the_cloud_-_An_octree_for_efficient_processing_of_3D_laser_scans","251507227_Development_of_a_hashing-based_data_structure_for_the_fast_retrieval_of_3D_terrestrial_laser_scanned_data","238880915_Uber_die_Reduction_der_Positeven_Quadratischen_Formen_mit_Drei_Unbestimmten_Ganzen_Zahlen","235267448_Sur_la_Sphere_Vide","233792575_Efficient_Processing_of_Large_3D_Point_Clouds","232626496_High_Quality_Interactive_Rendering_of_Massive_Point_Models_Using_Multi-way_kd-Trees","234789242_Efficient_octree_conversion_by_connectivity_labeling","234780289_Interactive_volume_rendering","228670399_XSplat_External_Memory_Multiresolution_Point_Visualization"]}
