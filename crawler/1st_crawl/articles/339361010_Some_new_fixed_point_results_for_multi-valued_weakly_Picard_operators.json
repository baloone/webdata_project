{"id":"339361010_Some_new_fixed_point_results_for_multi-valued_weakly_Picard_operators","abstract":"In this paper, we present some extensions of Banach contraction principle for multi-valued maps. Corresponding convergence theorems for the Picard iteration associated to a class of multi-valued operators are obtained in the setting of modular metric spaces. The presented results improve many recent fixed points results in the setting of modular metric spaces and also generalize some classical known results. Moreover, some examples are given.","authors":["Hassen Aydi","Abdelbasset Felhi","Erdal Karapinar","Hind Alshahrani"],"meta":["January 2019Filomat 33(13):4327-4341","DOI:10.2298/FIL1913327A"],"references":["332262171_Existence_of_Fixed_Points_of_Four_Maps_for_a_New_Generalized_F_-Contraction_and_an_Application","331629301_On_two_new_approaches_in_modular_spaces","331321531_Fixed-Discs_in_Rectangular_Metric_Spaces","328973993_A_Nadler-type_fixed_point_theorem_in_dislocated_spaces_and_applications","303806217_Fixed_points_in_modular_spaces_via_a-admissible_mappings_and_simulation_functions","276938643_Fixed_Point_Theorems_for_Ciric-Berinde_Type_Contractive_Multivalued_Mappings","273377754_Fixed_Points_of_Multivalued_Contraction_Mappings_in_Modular_Metric_Spaces","312804985_Multi-valued_contraction_mapping","268645710_Modulared_Semi-Ordered_Linear_Spaces","268027130_An_Extension_of_Banach's_Contraction_Principle"]}
