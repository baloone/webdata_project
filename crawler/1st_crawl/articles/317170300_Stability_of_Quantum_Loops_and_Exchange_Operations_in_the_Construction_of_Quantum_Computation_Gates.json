{"id":"317170300_Stability_of_Quantum_Loops_and_Exchange_Operations_in_the_Construction_of_Quantum_Computation_Gates","abstract":"Quantum information and quantum computation is a rapidly emergent field where quantum systems and their applications play a central role. In the gate version of quantum computation, the construction of universal quantum gates to manipulate quantum information is currently an intensive arena for quantum engineering. Specific properties of systems should be able to reproduce such idealized gates imitating the classically inspired computational gates. Recently, for magnetic systems driven by the bipartite Heisenberg-Ising model a universal set of gates has been realized, an alternative easy design for the Boykin set but using the Bell states as grammar. Exact control can be then used to construct specific prescriptions to achieve those gates. Physical parameters impose a challenge in the gate control. This work analyzes, based on the worst case quantum fidelity, the associated instability for the proposed set of gates. An strong performance is found in those gates for the most of quantum states involved.","authors":["Francisco Javier Delgado-Cepeda"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Physics Conference Series 839(1):012016","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/839/1/012016","Project: SU(2) reduction of multipartite two level systems"],"references":["310595042_Universal_Quantum_Gates_for_Quantum_Computation_on_Magnetic_Systems_Ruled_by_Heisenberg-Ising_Interactions","301879117_Quantum_metrology_with_full_and_fast_quantum_control","267153334_Algebraic_and_group_structure_for_bipartite_three_dimensional_anisotropic_Ising_model_on_a_non-local_basis","253717589_CPn_OR_Entanglement_Illustrated","2912099_On_Universal_and_Fault-Tolerant_Quantum_Computing"]}
