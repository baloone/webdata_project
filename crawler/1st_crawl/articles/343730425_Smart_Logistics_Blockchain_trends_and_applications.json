{"id":"343730425_Smart_Logistics_Blockchain_trends_and_applications","abstract":"The recent increase of new technologies and their involvement into all management processes call into question the smart logistics current models, in which massive amounts of data is collected and controlled. Smart Logistics is considered as fundamental pillar of the 4th industrial revolution 'industry 4.0'. This revolution is based on different concepts including the blockchain technology. Blockchain remains one of the buzzwords in the technological world. So that all sectors are focus on concrete use cases. However, few actors can boast of having devised revolutionary solutions. For good reasons, blockchain technology is still very complex to understand. The purpose of this study is to define the various applications of Blockchain in Smart Logistics, as well as to present concrete examples of these applications. This work was done by classifying the applications according to four clusters: Information, Transport, Finance, and Management, in addition to presenting the applications of each cluster.","authors":["Yassine Issaoui","Azeddine KHIAT","Ayoub Bahnasse","Ouajji Hassan"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks Volume 12(Issue 2 (2020)):9-15","DOI:10.5383/JUSPN.12.02.002","Project: IoT applications"],"references":["337429162_Smart_logistics_Study_of_the_application_of_blockchain_technology","331325030_Blockchain_Technology_Implementation_in_Logistics","325698093_Linking_Information_Systems_and_Entrepreneurship_A_Review_and_Agenda_for_IT-Associated_and_Digital_Entrepreneurship_Research","320353682_Mapping_the_Sea_of_Opportunities_Blockchain_in_Supply_Chain_and_Logistics","328345129_Blockchain_technology_and_its_relationships_to_sustainable_supply_chain_management","324139564_1_Blockchain's_roles_in_meeting_key_supply_chain_management_objectives","322227706_Green_innovation_and_organizational_performance_The_influence_of_big_data_and_the_moderating_role_of_management_commitment_and_HR_practices","322170789_Supply_Chain_Finance_and_Blockchain_Technology_The_Case_of_Reverse_Securitisation","321365495_The_Hyperledger_Project","321253670_Logistics_40_and_emerging_sustainable_business_models"]}
