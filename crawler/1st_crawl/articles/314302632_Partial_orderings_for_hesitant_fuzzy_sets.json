{"id":"314302632_Partial_orderings_for_hesitant_fuzzy_sets","abstract":"New partial orderings ≤o, ≤p and ≤H are defined, studied and compared on the set H of finite subsets of the unit interval with special emphasis on the last one. Since comparing two sets of the same cardinality is a simple issue, the idea for comparing two sets A and B of different cardinalities n and m respectively using ≤H is repeating their elements in order to obtain two series with the same length. If lcm(n,m) is the least common multiple of n and m we can repeat every element of A lcm(n,m)/m times and every element of B lcm(n,m)/n times to obtain such series and compare them (Definition 2.2).\n(H,≤H) is a bounded partially ordered set but not a lattice. Nevertheless, it will be shown that some interesting subsets of (H,≤H) have a lattice structure. Moreover in the set B of finite bags or multisets (i.e. allowing repetition of objects) of the unit interval a preorder ≤B can be defined in a similar way as ≤H in H and considering the quotient set B‾=B/∼ of B by the equivalence relation ∼ defined by A∼B when A≤BB and B≤BA, (B‾,≤B) is a lattice and (H,≤H) can be naturally embedded into it.","authors":["Luis Garmendia","Ramón González del Campo","Jorge Recasens Ferrés"],"meta":["March 2017International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 84","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2017.02.008"],"references":["262772215_Operators_and_Comparisons_of_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Linguistic_Term_Sets","220467602_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Linguistic_Term_Sets_for_Decision_Making","262235084_Aggregation_functions_for_typical_hesitant_fuzzy_elements_and_the_action_of_automorphisms","261675527_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Sets_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Directions","256721524_A_group_decision_making_model_dealing_with_comparative_linguistic_expressions_based_on_hesitant_fuzzy_linguistic_term_sets","233148772_On_the_theory_of_Bags","223359451_Hesitant_fuzzy_information_aggregation_in_decision_making","223141442_Nonstandard_conjunctions_and_implications_in_fuzzy_logic","223063768_Distance_and_similarity_measures_for_hesitant_fuzzy_sets","222972350_Triangular_norms_on_product_lattices","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","221358015_On_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Decision","220063913_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Sets"]}
