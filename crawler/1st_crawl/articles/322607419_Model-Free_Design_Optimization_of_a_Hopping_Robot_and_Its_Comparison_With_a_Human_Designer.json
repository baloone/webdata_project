{"id":"322607419_Model-Free_Design_Optimization_of_a_Hopping_Robot_and_Its_Comparison_With_a_Human_Designer","abstract":"When developing a robot, design iterations in the physical world are necessary, even though they are often costly and not systematic. Here we present an automated iterative design process without using modelling or simulation, which we refer to as “model-free design optimisation” based on Bayesian optimisation. This paper particularly focuses on the co-optimisation of morphology and controller, by using a mechanism to balance parameter specific costs (i.e. morphology samplings are more expensive than control ones) for effective and efficient design optimisation processes. A hopping robot was employed for a feasibility analysis of the proposed optimisation method, in which minimalistic two-dimensional and four- dimensional design optimisation experiments were performed in real life. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of improving both of the robot design problems within a defined time limits. The method is also compared to optimisation performances of a human designer under the same conditions. While the human optimisation performs better in the 2-dimensional search space, the automated method found the best solution quicker in the 4-dimensional case.","authors":["Kaur Aare Saar","Fabio Giardina","Fumiya Iida"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LRA.2018.2795646"],"references":["320362356_The_trade-off_between_morphology_and_control_in_the_co-optimized_design_of_robots","301846731_A_review_on_locomotion_robophysics_The_study_of_movement_at_the_intersection_of_robotics_soft_matter_and_dynamical_systems","292076565_Design_Optimisation_and_Control_of_Compliant_Actuation_Arrangements_in_Articulated_Robots_for_Improved_Energy_Efficiency","281389178_Morphological_Evolution_of_Physical_Robots_through_Model-Free_Phenotype_Development","280438171_Bayesian_Optimization_for_Learning_Gaits_under_Uncertainty","237133747_Iterative_Product_Engineering_Evolutionary_Robot_Design","221062831_A_MATLAB_framework_for_efficient_gait_creation","12338342_Automatic_design_and_manufacture_of_robotic_lifeforms","3847763_Design_and_actuation_optimization_of_a_4-axes_biped_robot_for_walking_and_running","317005986_Evolutionary_Developmental_Robotics_Improving_Morphology_and_Control_of_Physical_Robots","315469255_Discrete_Foot_Shape_Changes_Improve_Dynamics_of_a_Hopping_Robot","297677133_Improving_Efficiency_for_an_Open-loop_Controlled_Locomotion_with_a_Pulsed_Actuation","286993753_Self-stable_one-legged_hopping_using_a_curved_foot","234778059_Practical_Bayesian_Optimization","225307589_Practical_Bayesian_Optimization_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","222864746_Application_of_evolved_locomotion_controllers_to_a_hexapod_robot","220721039_Evolving_virtual_creatures","48166394_A_Tutorial_on_Bayesian_Optimization_of_Expensive_Cost_Functions_with_Application_to_Active_User_Modeling_and_Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning","4122044_Stochastic_policy_gradient_reinforcement_learning_on_a_simple_3D_biped","2370002_The_Road_Less_Travelled_Morphology_in_the_Optimization_of_Biped_Robot_Locomotion"]}
