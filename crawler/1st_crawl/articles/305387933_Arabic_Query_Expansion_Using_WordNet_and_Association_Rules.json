{"id":"305387933_Arabic_Query_Expansion_Using_WordNet_and_Association_Rules","abstract":"Query expansion is the process of adding additional relevant terms to the original queries to improve the performance of information retrieval systems. However, previous studies showed that automatic query expansion using WordNet do not lead to an improvement in the performance. One of the main challenges of query expansion is the selection of appropriate terms. In this paper, we review this problem using Arabic WordNet and Association Rules within the context of Arabic Language. The results obtained confirmed that with an appropriate selection method, we are able to exploit Arabic WordNet to improve the retrieval performance. Our empirical results on a sub-corpus from the Xinhua collection showed that our automatic selection method has achieved a significant performance improvement in terms of MAP and recall and a better precision with the first top retrieved documents.","authors":["Ahmed Abbache","Farid Meziane","Ghalem Belalem","Fatma Zohra Belkredim"],"meta":["September 2016International Journal of Intelligent Information Technologies 12(3)","DOI:10.4018/IJIIT.2016070104","Project: Automatic image annotation"],"references":["270377016_Utilisation_Des_Ressources_Externes_Pour_la_Reformulation_des_Requetes_Dans_un_Systeme_de_Recherche_D'Information","267711829_A_Query_Expansion_Technique_Using_the_EWC_Semantic_Relatedness_Measure","267099998_A_Semantic_Approach_for_Text_Clustering_using_WordNet_and_Lexical_Chains","255612700_Arabic_WordNet_and_the_Challenges_of_Arabic","319393666_Modern_Information_Retrieval","314814275_Probabilistic_query_expansion_using_query_logs","305387914_The_Use_of_Arabic_WordNet_in_Arabic_Information_Retrieval","301222514_Modern_Information_Retrieval","274868244_Improving_pseudo_relevance_feedback_based_query_expansion_using_genetic_fuzzy_approach_and_semantic_similarity_notion","239057910_Effectiveness_of_query_expansion_in_ranked-output_document_retrieval_systems"]}
