{"id":"261127021_Sybil_attack_defending_trusted_AODV_in_ad-hoc_netwok","abstract":"Security is most essential for communication in ad-hoc network to secure data delivery between source node and destination node. A very well known harmful attack is Sybil attack where a node pretends multiple identities of several target nodes. In this paper, we have introduced an on-demand trusted approach to defend Sybil attack. We have chosen a on-demand routing protocol, AODV and proposed a trust computation based sybil attack avoidance mechanism in AODV, by enhancing the protocol along with the context aware TOR (Trusted On-demand Routing) model. In proposed model, three major modules: Node Manager, Trust Module and Decision Manager are included. Decision Manager secures the routing path on basis of the trust value, computed in the Trust Module. Node Manager reacts accordingly to AODV in response. Our analysis and simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposal against sybil attack.","authors":["Swarnali Hazra","Sanjit Kumar Setua"],"meta":["December 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICCSNT.2012.6526018","Conference: Computer Science and Network Technology (ICCSNT), 2012 2nd International Conference on"],"references":["265602684_Detection_of_Sybil_attack_in_Mobile_wireless_sensor_networks","263150755_Node_ID_based_detection_of_Sybil_attack_in_mobile_wireless_sensor_network","235622319_Countermeasures_of_Network_Layer_Attacks_in_MANETs","269031887_The_Sybil_attack_in_sensor_networks_Analysis_defenses","260302079_AODV_Routing_Implementation_for_Scalable_Wireless_Ad-Hoc_Network_Simulation_SWANS","221283942_The_sybil_attack_in_sensor_networks_analysis_defenses","46122401_Sybil_Nodes_Detection_Based_on_Received_Signal_Strength_Variations_within_VANET"]}
