{"id":"23160375_Physical_discomfort_and_psychosocial_job_stress_among_male_and_female_operators_at_telecommunication_call_centers_in_Taiwan","abstract":"The prevalence of job stress, distributions of major job stressors, and associations between perceived job stress levels and multiple physical discomforts are assessed via a cross-sectional study of 1023 male and female operators at telecommunication call centers in Taiwan. Cases of discomfort are identified via questionnaire surveys requiring respondents to self-reported symptoms of discomfort. Information is obtained on demographics, health status, perceived job stress levels, major job stressors and psychosocial job characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression models are developed to predict physical discomfort in nine body areas. 'Eye strain', 'hoarse or painful throat' and 'musculoskeletal discomfort' are the most pronounced and prevalent complaints after prolonged work time at call centers. Female operators had higher prevalence of physical discomfort than male operators for all body areas. 'Encountering difficult customers' ranked as the most important job stress factor among both male and female operators. Working in a call center for more than 4 years is strongly associated with discomfort in all body areas (odds ratio ranges from 1.65 to 2.15). Analysis of risk factors vs. physical discomfort reveals that operators who perceive higher job stress have significantly increased risk of several health complaints, including eye strain, tinnitus, hoarse or painful throat, chronic cough with phlegm, chest tightness, irritable stomach or peptic ulcers, frequent urination and musculoskeletal discomfort.","authors":["Yen-Hui Lin","Chih-Yong Chen","Shih-Yi Lu"],"meta":["September 2008Applied Ergonomics 40(4):561-8","DOI:10.1016/j.apergo.2008.02.024","SourcePubMed"],"references":["234837449_Job_Strain_and_Cardiovascular_Disease","225610338_A_national_survey_of_psychosocial_job_stressors_and_their_implications_for_health_among_working_people_in_Taiwan","20481538_Cardiovascular_diseases_and_the_work_environment_A_critical_review_of_the_epidemiologic_literature_on_nonchemical_factors","19065712_Work_with_video_display_terminals_among_office_employees_I_Subjective_symptoms_and_discomfort","15254712_Job_Strain_and_Health-Related_Quality_of_Life_in_a_National_Sample","13718842_Relations_of_job_strain_and_iso-strain_to_health_status_in_a_cohort_of_women_in_the_United_States","13582644_Musculoskeletal_visual_and_psychosocial_stress_in_VDU_operators_before_and_after_multidisciplinary_ergonomic_interventions","13481816_The_Job_Content_Questionnaire_JCQ_An_Instrument_for_Internationally_Comparative_Assessments_of_Psychosocial_Job_Characteristics","10904667_Reliability_and_Validity_of_the_Chinese_Version_of_the_Job_Content_Questionnaire_C-JCQ_in_Taiwanese_Workers","9037063_Occupational_groups_at_risk_of_voice_disorders_A_review_of_the_literature","7473564_Risk_Factors_for_Musculoskeletal_Symptoms_among_Call_Center_Operators_of_a_Bank_in_Sao_Paulo_Brazil","259704631_Psychosocial_Risk_Factors_in_Call_Centres_An_Evaluation_of_Work_Design_and_Well-Being","251206652_NOISE_EXPOSURE_OF_BROADCAST_PRODUCTION_PERSONNEL","247750376_Call_Centre_Companies_and_New_Patterns_of_Organization","235145530_Health_and_Safety_Issues_of_Telecommuters_A_Macroergonomic_Perspective","227832749_Work_organization_is_significantly_associated_with_upper_extremities_musculoskeletal_disorders_among_employees_engaged_in_interactive_computer-telephone_tasks_of_an_international_bank_subsidiary_in_Sa","226213583_The_Patterning_of_Psychological_Attributes_and_Distress_by_Job_Strain_and_Social_Support_in_a_Sample_of_Working_Men","222218821_Self-reported_working_conditions_of_VDU_operators_and_associations_with_musculoskeletal_symptoms_A_cross-sectional_study_focussing_on_gender_differences","220302718_Effects_of_Electronic_Performance_Monitoring_On_Job_Design_and_Worker_Stress_Results_of_Two_Studies","220302400_Well-being_and_computer-mediated_work_of_various_occupational_groups_in_banking_and_insurance","21294686_Work_Posture_Workstation_Design_and_Musculoskeletal_Discomfort_in_a_VDT_Data_Entry_Task","20859144_Work-related_psychosocial_stress_and_risk_of_preterm_low_birthweight_delivery","18724405_Keyboard_Operating_Posture_and_Symptoms_in_Operating","15861317_Postural_and_visual_loads_at_VDT_work_places","15242257_Musculoskeletal_disorders_among_visual_display_terminal_users_in_a_telecommunications_company","14866726_Occupational_Injuries_Comparing_the_Rates_of_Male_and_Female_Postal_Workers","14685925_Women_in_Nontraditional_Jobs_Is_There_a_Risk_for_Musculoskeletal_Injury","13996385_The_Association_of_job_Strain_and_Health_Behaviours_in_men_and_Women","13486658_Lung_Function_and_General_Illness_Symptoms_in_a_Semiconductor_Manufacturing_Facility","11366638_Prevalence_and_Risk_Factors_for_Voice_Problems_Among_Telemarketers","11362497_Computer-telephone_interactive_tasks_Predictors_of_musculoskeletal_disorders_according_to_work_analysis_and_workers'_perception","11057348_Assessment_of_the_Noise_Exposure_of_Call_Centre_Operators","10929450_Do_ergonomics_improvements_increase_computer_workers'_productivity_An_intervention_study_in_a_call_centre","10810383_Physical_Discomfort_Among_Visual_Display_Terminal_Users_in_a_Semiconductor_Manufacturing_Company_A_Study_of_Prevalence_and_Relation_to_Psychosocial_and_PhysicalErgonomic_Factors","8505828_Working_conditions_and_health_among_female_and_male_employees_at_a_call_center_in_Sweden","8054954_Operator_stress_and_monitoring_practise","8054953_Employee_Stress_and_Health_Complaints_in_Jobs_with_and_without_Electronic_Performance_Monitoring"]}
