{"id":"257953015_Scattering_reduction_for_an_acoustic_sensor_using_a_multilayered_shell_comprising_a_pair_of_homogeneous_isotropic_single-negative_media","abstract":"We have designed a cylindrical multilayered structure to reduce scattering for an acoustic sensor while allowing it to receive external information. The proposed structure consists of two alternately arranged complementary media with homogeneous isotropic single-negative parameters. Numerical results show that the acoustic scattering from the sensor is suppressed considerably when the number of bilayers is large enough and the thickness of each bilayer is much smaller than the incident wavelength. This may be particularly significant for practical applications where acoustic measurements would otherwise be disturbed by the insertion of sensors.","authors":["Tao Xu","Xue-Feng Zhu","Bin Liang","Yong Li"],"meta":["July 2012Applied Physics Letters 101(3)","DOI:10.1063/1.4737873"],"references":["253993277_A_multilayer_structured_acoustic_cloak_with_homogeneous_isotropic_materials","234890423_Acoustic_cloaking_in_three_dimensions_using_acoustic_metamaterials","231120819_On_cloaking_for_elasticity_and_physical_equations_with_a_transformation_invariant_form","231003650_Analysis_of_Cummer-Schurig_acoustic_cloaking","252286330_Design_of_an_ideal_spherical_hydrophone_using_a_plasmonic_acoustic_cloak","243506045_Properties_of_a_periodically_stratified_acoustic_half-space_and_its_relation_to_a_Biot_fluid","231117858_One_path_to_acoustic_cloaking","231018911_Concealing_a_Passive_Sensing_System_with_Single-Negative_Layers","222409465_Design_of_electromagnetic_cloaks_and_concentrators_using_form-invariant_coordinate_transformations_of_Maxwell's_equations","49752305_Acoustic_Cloaking_by_a_Superlens_with_Single-Negative_Materials"]}
