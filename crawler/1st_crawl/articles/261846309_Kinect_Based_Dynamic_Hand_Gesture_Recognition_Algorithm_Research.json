{"id":"261846309_Kinect_Based_Dynamic_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Algorithm_Research","abstract":"In dynamic gesture track recognition, gesture recognition rate has always been a problem, Because the traditional hand gesture recognition in how to separate the hand type from the surrounding environment, and then determine the palm position has been one of the difficult problems. This paper presents a Kinect based dynamic gesture trajectory identification method, use OpenNI where palm is defined as a Kinect node, quickly and accurately get the palm position coordinates, and then use the HMM technology to do gesture model training to improve the recognition rate. The experimental results show that this method of gesture track recognition rate is higher than the traditional.","authors":["Youwen Wang","Cheng Yang","Xiaoyu Wu","Shengmiao Xu"],"meta":["August 2012","DOI:10.1109/IHMSC.2012.76","Conference: Proceedings of the 2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics - Volume 01"],"references":["269304811_Hand_gesture_recognition_An_overview","221156744_Human_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Using_Motion_Orientation_Histogram_for_Interaction_of_Handicapped_Persons_with_Computer","272353472_History_of_wikis_---_Wikipedia_The_Free_Encyclopedia","241194638_Toy_Story_---_Wikipedia_The_Free_Encyclopedia","3845445_Gesture_modeling_and_recognition_using_finite_state_machines"]}
