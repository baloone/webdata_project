{"id":"267216854_Collaboration_Collusion_and_Plagiarism_in_Computer_Science_Coursework","abstract":"This report contains an overview of university policies toward academic dishonesty, and the efficacy of these policies upon student education. We discuss the idiosyncratic nature of how collaboration, collusion and plagiarism are defined by students, instructors and administration. Af-ter considering some of the common reasons for dishonest behaviour among students, we look at some methods that have been suggested for mitigating them. Finally, we consider some ideas for improving computer science courses in this context. We suggest emphasizing the intended learning outcomes of each assignment, providing tutorial ses-sions to facilitate acceptable collaboration, and finally to deliver quizzes related to assignment content after each assignment is submitted.","authors":["Robert Fraser","David R Cheriton"],"meta":["September 2014Informatics in Education 13(2)","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2014.01"],"references":["262322336_A_Source_Code_Similarity_System_for_Plagiarism_Detection","254267510_Investigating_Differences_in_Cheating_Behaviours_of_IT_Undergraduate_and_Graduate_Students_The_maturity_and_motivation_factors","252606987_Academic_Dishonesty_Plagiarism_Included_in_the_Digital_Age_A_Literature_Review","234750715_Academic_Dishonesty_and_the_Perceived_Effectiveness_of_Countermeasures_An_Empirical_Survey_of_Cheating_at_a_Major_Public_University","229025469_Student_attitudes_to_plagiarism_and_collusion_within_computer_science","228637370_The_Learning_Environment_in_Clicker_Classrooms_Student_Processes_of_Learning_and_Involvement_in_Large_University-Level_Courses_using_Student_Response_Systems","228189968_Perceptions_of_the_Prevalence_and_Seriousness_of_Academic_Dishonesty_in_Australian_Universities","225642406_Academic_dishonesty_A_zero_tolerance_professor_and_student_registration_choices","224132474_Source_Code_Plagiarism-A_Student_Perspective","220832231_Determination_of_Factors_which_Impact_on_IT_Students'_Propensity_to_Cheat","220328285_An_Approach_to_Source-Code_Plagiarism_Detection_and_Investigation_Using_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","220017646_Plagiarism_-_A_Survey","45166174_Patterns_correlates_and_reduction_of_homework_copying","41389154_First-Year_University_Science_and_Engineering_Students'_Understanding_of_Plagiarism","2911704_Student_Culture_vs_Group_Work_in_Computer_Science","2544611_Strategies_For_Promoting_Academic_Integrity_In_Cs_Courses","284201649_Forget_about_policing_plagiarism_Just_teach","266653383_Academic_integrity_policies_in_a_computing_education_context","257576186_Turning_a_Blind_Eye_Faculty_Who_Ignore_Student_Cheating","256816588_Examining_the_Cheats_The_Role_of_Conscientiousness_and_Excitement_Seeking_in_Academic_Dishonesty","251857622_Staff_and_Student_Perceptions_of_Plagiarism_and_Cheating","251479658_The_Uses_of_Learning_Outcomes","251219115_Embedding_plagiarism_education_in_the_assessment_process","248966656_Learning_outcomes_A_conceptual_analysis","248966227_'At_least_they're_learning_something'_The_hazy_line_between_collaboration_and_collusion","248203601_Undergraduate_Cheating_Who_Does_What_and_Why","238397736_Guilty_in_Whose_Eyes_University_students'_perceptions_of_cheating_and_plagiarism_in_academic_work_and_assessment","234758859_Addressing_student_cheating_Definitions_and_solutions","234607365_What_We_Know_About_Cheating_In_College_Longitudinal_Trends_and_Recent_Developments","234126993_A_Comparison_of_Source_Code_Plagiarism_Detection_Engines","229954157_Can_Turnitin_be_used_to_provide_instant_formative_feedback","225983535_Take_home_tests_An_experimental_study","225920948_Judging_Plagiarism_A_Problem_of_Morality_and_Convention","221538088_Collaborative_learning_in_an_introductory_computer_science_course","220807883_Computing_student_practices_of_cheating_and_plagiarism_A_decade_of_change","31776742_Creating_Significant_Learning_Experiences_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Designing_College_Courses_LD_Fink","6617873_Australia_needs_an_office_of_academic_integrity","3981310_Strategies_for_promoting_academic_integrity_in_CS_courses","3052949_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Nonoriginal_Content_in_Final-Year_Computing_Undergraduate_Projects"]}
