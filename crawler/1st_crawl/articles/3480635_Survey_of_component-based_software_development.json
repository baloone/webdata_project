{"id":"3480635_Survey_of_component-based_software_development","abstract":"Because of the extensive uses of components, the Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) process is quite different from that of the traditional waterfall approach. CBSE not only requires focus on system specification and development, but also requires additional consideration for overall system context, individual components properties and component acquisition and integration process. The term component-based software development (CBD) can be referred to as the process for building a system using components. CBD life cycle consists of a set of phases, namely, identifying and selecting components based on stakeholder requirements, integrating and assembling the selected components and updating the system as components evolve over time with newer versions. This work presents an indicative literature survey of techniques proposed for different phases of the CBD life cycle. The aim of this survey is to help provide a better understanding of different CBD techniques for each of these areas","authors":["Sajjad Mahmood","Richard Lai","Y.S.
