{"id":"311411929_SEXWISE_An_IBM_Watson-Powered_Mobile_Application_to_Promote_Sexual_Education","abstract":"Adolescents and young adults are particularly at-risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or having unplanned pregnancies. They use the Internet and mobile technologies constantly for different purposes, one of which is searching information concerning sexual health. Cognitive computing systems try to mimic the thinking process of humans. A famous success case is IBM Watson TM , which uses several Artificial Intelligence techniques to understand the information contained in a document corpus (holding MS Word, PDF and web page documents), to answer questions. SEXWISE is a Java-based, Android mobile phone application prototype which employs IBM Watson TM 's cog-nitive capabilities to answer questions concerning sexual-ity. Watson was fed with trustworthy, officially-sanctioned and openly-accessible documents concerning sexuality and sexual health, and trained by asking it over 800 sexuality-related questions. SEXWISE also queries Google Maps TM to find health care professionals in the vicinity.","authors":["Miguel Royo-Leon","Laura Rodriguez","Paola Gallardo","Timothy Gonzalez"],"meta":["October 2016","Conference: Mexican International Conference on Computer Science 2016 (ENC 2016)At: Chihuahua, Mexico","Project: SEXWISE: IBM Watson-powered Mobile App"],"references":["286376855_Social_Media_Mobile_Internet_Use_Among_Teens_and_Young_Adults","220605292_Building_Watson_An_Overview_of_the_DeepQA_Project","321526107_Metadata-driven_Software_Systems_in_Biomedicine","260624020_Introduction_to_This_is_Watson","234803390_Natural_language_question-answering_systems_1969","226088508_What_Is_Metadata"]}
