{"id":"283433526_A_Multiple_Search_Operator_Heuristic_for_the_Max-k-cut_Problem","abstract":"The max-k-cut problem is to partition the vertices of a weighted graph $G =\n(V,E)$ into $k\\geq2$ disjoint subsets such that the weight sum of the edges\ncrossing the different subsets is maximized. The problem is referred as the\nmax-cut problem when $k=2$. In this work, we present a multiple operator\nheuristic (MOH) for the general max-k-cut problem. MOH employs five distinct\nsearch operators organized into three search phases to effectively explore the\nsearch space. Experiments on two sets of 91 well-known benchmark instances show\nthat the proposed algorithm is highly effective on the max-k-cut problem and\nimproves the current best known results (new lower bounds) of most of the\ntested instances. For the popular special case $k=2$ (i.e., the max-cut\nproblem), MOH also performs remarkably well by discovering 6 improved best\nknown results. We provide additional studies to shed light on the alternative\ncombinations of the employed search operators.","authors":["Fuda Ma","Jin-Kao Hao"],"meta":["January 2017Annals of Operations Research 248(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s10479-016-2234-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281096631_Speeding_up_a_memetic_algorithm_for_the_max-bisection_problem","273275706_Teams_of_Global_Equilibrium_Search_Algorithms_for_Solving_the_Weighted_Maximum_Cut_Problem_in_Parallel","262257767_A_Memetic_Approach_for_the_Max-Cut_Problem","262239890_Max-k-Cut_by_the_Discrete_Dynamic_Convexized_Method","262162554_An_Application_of_Combinatorial_Optimization_to_Statistical_Physics_and_Circuit_Layout_Design","261859447_Probabilistic_GRASP-Tabu_Search_algorithms_for_the_UBQP_problem","313196027_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","277930600_A_tabu_search_based_hybrid_evolutionary_algorithm_for_the_max-cut_problem","263050753_An_Efficient_Memetic_Algorithm_for_theMax-Bisection_Problem"]}
