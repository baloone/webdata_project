{"id":"223788392_The_numerical_tokamak_project_simulation_of_turbulent_transport","abstract":"Three-dimensional fluid and kinetic models are being used to simulate the turbulent confinement of energy and plasma in the core of tokamaks. These simulations represent a qualitative improvement in the realism with which they model large tokamak experiments, because they use realistic plasma parameters and incorporate important geometrical effects. The combination of algorithm improvements and the application of high-performance computing methodology including the use of massively parallel computers has enabled dramatic improvements in simulation capability. A consortium of research groups from universities and national laboratories are collaborating in this effort which is entitled the Numerical Tokamak Project and is supported in part by the High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative.","authors":["B.I.
