It investigated studentsâ€™ opinions of Sharurah College of Science and Arts about the benefits and challenges based on their learning experiences in a hybrid learning environment. The researcher used both quantitative and qualitative methods to address the research questions. The study shows the following findings: a MOOC platform, as a new source for learning, supports teaching and learning in a hybrid learning environment; it can be used to support traditional learning; students like and are interested in a hybrid MOOC learning environment; and, finally, the most challenges affecting the hybrid MOOC environment are Internet drop/low speed connections and limited time for discussion in the MOOC.","authors":["Mohssen Hakami"],"meta":["April 2019Journal of Educational Issues 5(1):44","DOI:10.5296/jei.v5i1.14396","Project: UTILIZATION OF VIRTUAL CLASSROOM"],"references":["315819307_The_nature_and_level_of_learner-learner_interaction_in_a_chemistry_massive_open_online_course_MOOC","264089856_Watching_MOOCs_together_investigating_co-located_MOOC_study_groups","260084403_Teaching_entrepreneurship_using_Massive_Open_Online_Course_MOOC","320140958_An_adaptive_hybrid_MOOC_model_Disrupting_the_MOOC_concept_in_higher_education","318133891_Improving_Video_Engagement_by_Gamification_A_Proposed_Design_of_MOOC_Videos","306921570_Participation_patterns_in_a_massive_open_online_course_MOOC_about_statistics_MOOC_Participation","306241371_Is_peer_review_an_appropriate_form_of_assessment_in_a_MOOC_Student_participation_and_performance_in_formative_peer_review","287717013_Lessons_Learned_Through_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","262606694_DisOrganization_and_Success_in_an_Economics_MOOC","249830842_Mapping_the_Field_of_Mixed_Methods_Research"]}
