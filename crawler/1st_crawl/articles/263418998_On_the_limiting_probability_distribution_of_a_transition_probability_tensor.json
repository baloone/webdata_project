{"id":"263418998_On_the_limiting_probability_distribution_of_a_transition_probability_tensor","abstract":"In this paper, we propose and develop an iterative method to calculate a limiting probability distribution vector of a transition probability tensor [Inline formula] arising from a higher order Markov chain. In the model, the computation of such limiting probability distribution vector [Inline formula] can be formulated as a [Inline formula]-eigenvalue problem [Inline formula] associated with the eigenvalue 1 of [Inline formula] where all the entries of [Inline formula] are required to be non-negative and its summation must be equal to one. This is an analog of the matrix case for a limiting probability vector of a transition probability matrix arising from the first-order Markov chain. We show that if [Inline formula] is a transition probability tensor, then solutions of this [Inline formula]-eigenvalue problem exist. When [Inline formula] is irreducible, all the entries of solutions are positie. With some suitable conditions of [Inline formula], the limiting probability distribution vector is even unique. Under the same uniqueness assumption, the linear convergence of the iterative method can be established. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results of the proposed model and the iterative method.","authors":["Wen Li","Michael K.
