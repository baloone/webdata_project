{"id":"316945858_Design_and_implementation_of_high_performance_motion_controller_for_2-D_delta_robot","abstract":"Conventionally, software-based motion controllers are used to execute many automation systems in the industry. Most of these controller reveal several drawbacks such as large accumulated error, does not guarantee real-time characteristics when generating motion profile based on software. In this paper, the implementation of embeded motion controller for many applications is presented. ARM Cortex M4 is designed in this controller to handle the communication between host PC and controller. To enhance the high performance of generating trajectory path, hardware-based motion chipset is integrated into the controller. Experimental platform of 2-D delta robot is driven by proposed controller to show the pick and place operations. Several results are carried out to validate the effectiveness and feasibility.","authors":["Ha Quang Thinh Ngo","Quoc Chi Nguyen","Nguyen thanh phuong"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICIST.2017.7926505","Conference: 2017 Seventh International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)"],"references":["286586021_Monitoring_and_control_of_PLC_based_motion_control_systems_via_device-net","283889821_Implementation_of_Input_Shaping_Control_to_Reduce_Residual_Vibration_in_Industrial_Network_Motion_System","306304628_Design_and_Simulation_of_a_Delta_Type_Robot","261347062_Performance_analysis_of_Mechatrolink-III","261241559_DSP-Based_Motion_Controller_development_for_Milling_Machine","232655460_An_Open-Architecture_Embedded_Manufacturing_Control_System","232618487_A_New_Design_of_Multiaxial_Efficient_Motion_Control_Card_Based_on_MCU_and_FPGA","224619801_Development_and_analysis_of_a_PC-based_object-oriented_real-time_robotics_controller","224324620_Research_and_Development_of_DSP_Based_Servo_Motion_Controller","4288147_Implementation_of_2-axis_Circular_Interpolation_for_a_FPGA-based_4-axis_Motion_Controller","4185150_Design_and_implementation_of_real-time_NURBS_interpolator_using_a_FPGA-based_motion_controller"]}
