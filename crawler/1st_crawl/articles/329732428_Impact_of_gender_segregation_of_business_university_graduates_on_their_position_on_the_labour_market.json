The aim of this article is to evaluate the influence of the higher education on the role of gender within selected factors influencing employment of graduates on the labour market on the example of the University of Economics and Management. The areas of the influence of employability of graduates have been analysed using the characteristics of a position level, persistence in a studied branch, perception of a financial reward as adequate and holding a position, for which the higher education is required. The theoretical frame of the article is made of a literary search based on an analysis of scientific articles and publications dealing with the influence of gender on employment of graduates and factors influencing it. The primary research was conducted as a questionnaire survey among graduates of the University of Economics and Management from the previous 5 years. We received back 206 questionnaires from the total of 805 graduates. The results show that, although the number of higher educated women is increasing, their position on the labour market is still different compared to men. The higher education does not lead to the elimination of the gender differences on the labour market and within the working environment. These differences show in a type of employment, working positions and also wages.","authors":["M. Šnýdrová","Lucie Depoo","I. Šnýdrová"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":[]}
