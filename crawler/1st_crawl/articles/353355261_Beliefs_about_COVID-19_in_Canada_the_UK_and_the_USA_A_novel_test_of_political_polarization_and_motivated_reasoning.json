{"id":"353355261_Beliefs_about_COVID-19_in_Canada_the_UK_and_the_USA_A_novel_test_of_political_polarization_and_motivated_reasoning","abstract":"What are the psychological consequences of the increasingly politicized nature of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States relative to similar Western countries? In a two-wave study completed early (March) and later (December) in the pandemic, we found that polarization was greater in the U.S. (N=1,339) than in Canada (N=644) and the U.K. (N=1,283). Political conservatism in the U.S. was strongly associated with engaging in weaker mitigation behaviors, lower COVID-19 risk perceptions, greater misperceptions, and stronger vaccination hesitancy. Although there was some evidence that cognitive sophistication was associated with increased polarization in the U.S. in December (but not March), cognitive sophistication was nonetheless consistently negatively correlated with misperceptions and vaccination hesitancy across time, countries, and party lines. Furthermore, COVID-19 skepticism in the U.S. was strongly correlated with distrust in liberal-leaning mainstream news outlets and trust in conservative-leaning news outlets, suggesting that polarization may be driven by differences in information environments.","authors":["Gordon Pennycook","Jonathon Mcphetres","Bence Bago","David Gertler Rand"],"meta":["May 2021"],"references":[]}
