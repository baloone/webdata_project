Seven parameters including corneal deformation amplitude (CDA), inward/outward corneal applanation length, inward/outward corneal velocity (ICV and OCV), peak distance, and radius were measured. Pearson correlation and linear mixed-effects model were done.\n\nResults: \nA total of 180 eyes were recruited. 98 eyes were NM, 30 eyes were MM, and 52 eyes were HM. There were significant correlations of OCV to the degree of refractive error (r = 0.203, p < 0.001) and AL (r = -0.242, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, intraocular pressure, and corneal thickness, there was significantly higher CDA (β = 0.07, p < 0.001), faster OCV (β = -0.08, p < 0.001), and smaller radius (β = -0.39, p=0.01) in the HM group compared to the NM group.\n\nConclusion: \nThe higher CDA, faster OCV, and smaller radius found in the HM may suggest that these eyes have reduced ocular stiffness and may be less stable and more prone to stress.","authors":["Aratchaporn Tubtimthong","Sunee Chansangpetch","Nitee Ratprasatporn","Anita Manassakorn"],"meta":["January 2020BioMed Research International 2020(8):1-7","DOI:10.1155/2020/8618615"],"references":["320080240_Global_and_regional_estimates_of_prevalence_of_refractive_errors_Systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","315952190_Glaucoma_in_high_myopia_and_parapapillary_delta_zone","305662984_Corneal_Biomechanics_Determination_in_Healthy_Myopic_Subjects","303960728_Role_of_Age_and_Myopia_in_Simultaneous_Assessment_of_Corneal_and_Extraocular_Tissue_Stiffness_by_Air-Puff_Applanation","283958244_Corneal_Biomechanical_Properties_in_Myopic_Eyes_Measured_by_a_Dynamic_Scheimpflug_Analyzer","320984806_Corneal_Biomechanical_Properties_in_High_Myopia_Measured_by_Dynamic_Scheimpflug_Imaging_Technology","320000268_The_epidemics_of_myopia_Aetiology_and_prevention","317817124_Characteristics_of_corneal_biomechanical_responses_detected_by_a_non-contact_scheimpflug-based_tonometer_in_eyes_with_glaucoma","313640869_A_study_of_biochemical_and_biomechanical_qualities_of_normal_and_myopic_eye_sclera_in_humans_of_different_age_groups","311164259_Epidemiology_of_Myopia"]}
