{"id":"249015062_Who_Succeeds_at_University_Factors_predicting_academic_performance_in_first_year_Australian_university_students","abstract":"With the increasing diversity of students attending university, there is a growing interest in the factors predicting academic performance. This study is a prospective investigation of the academic, psychosocial, cognitive, and demographic predictors of academic performance of first year Australian university students. Questionnaires were distributed to 197 first year students 4 to 8 weeks prior to the end of semester exams and overall grade point averages were collected at semester completion. Previous academic performance was identified as the most significant predictor of university performance. Integration into university, self efficacy, and employment responsibilities were also predictive of university grades. Identifying the factors that influence academic performance can improve the targeting of interventions and support services for students at risk of academic problems.","authors":["Kirsten Vallmuur","Robert Schweitzer"],"meta":["May 2001Higher Education Research and Development 20(1):21-33","DOI:10.1080/07924360120043621"],"references":["236026224_Drop-Outs_From_Higher_Education_A_Theoretical_Synthesis_of_Recent_Research","305166663_Dropout_from_Higher_Education_A_Theoretical_Synthesis_of_Recent_Research","284685251_Problems_of_retention_in_tertiary_education","266460043_The_Point_of_View_of_the_Student_in_Attrition_Research","249797641_Studies_of_College_Attrition_1950-1975","248057906_Dropouts_from_Higher_Education_Toward_an_Empirical_Model","234659427_Academic_Subenvironments_and_Differential_Patterns_of_Self-Perceived_Growth_during_College_A_Test_of_Holland's_Theory_ASHE_Annual_Meeting_Paper","232595561_Explanatory_Style_and_Academic_Performance_Among_University_Freshmen","232551751_Relation_of_self-efficacy_to_academic_achievement_and_persistence","232480555_Comparison_of_Three_Theoretically_Derived_Variables_in_Predicting_Career_and_Academic_Behavior_Self-Efficacy_Interest_Congruence_and_Consequence_Thinking"]}
