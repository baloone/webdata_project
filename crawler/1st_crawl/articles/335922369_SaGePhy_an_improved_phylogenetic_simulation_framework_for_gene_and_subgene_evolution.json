{"id":"335922369_SaGePhy_an_improved_phylogenetic_simulation_framework_for_gene_and_subgene_evolution","abstract":"SaGePhy is a software package for improved phylogenetic simulation of gene and subgene evolution. SaGePhy can be used to generate species trees, gene trees and subgene or (protein) domain trees using a probabilistic birth-death process that allows for gene and subgene duplication, horizontal gene and subgene transfer and gene and subgene loss. SaGePhy implements a range of important features not found in other phylogenetic simulation frameworks/software. These include (i) simulation of subgene or domain level evolution inside one or more gene trees, (ii) simultaneous simulation of both additive and replacing horizontal gene/subgene transfers and (iii) probabilistic sampling of species tree and gene tree nodes, respectively, for gene- and domain-family birth. SaGePhy is open-source, platform independent and written in Java and Python.\n\nAvailability and implementation: \nExecutables, source code (open-source under the revised BSD license) and a detailed manual are freely available from http://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/software/sagephy/.\n\nSupplementary information: \nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Soumya Kundu","Mukul S Bansal"],"meta":["September 2019Bioinformatics 35(18):3496-3498","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz081"],"references":["325640396_Zombi_A_simulator_of_species_genes_and_genomes_that_accounts_for_extinct_lineages","324772539_RANGER-DTL_20_Rigorous_Reconstruction_of_Gene-Family_Evolution_by_Duplication_Transfer_and_Loss","283493643_SimPhy_Phylogenomic_Simulation_of_Gene_Locus_and_Species_Trees","282760720_Event_inference_in_multidomain_families_with_phylogenetic_reconciliation","260375362_A_Bayesian_Method_for_Analyzing_Lateral_Gene_Transfer","242332317_GenPhyloData_Realistic_simulation_of_gene_family_evolution","232066687_Phylogenetic_modeling_of_lateral_gene_transfer_reconstructs_the_pattern_and_relative_timing_of_speciations","225293579_Efficient_Algorithms_for_the_Reconciliation_Problem_with_Gene_Duplication_Horizontal_Transfer_and_Loss","225056638_Replacing_and_Additive_Horizontal_Gene_Transfer_in_Streptococcus","51870605_ALF-A_Simulation_Framework_for_Genome_Evolution","49754049_Simultaneous_Identification_of_Duplications_and_Lateral_Gene_Transfers","49694635_Rapid_evolutionary_innovation_during_an_Archaean_Genetic_Expansion","45237377_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_GeneSpecies_Trees_Parsimonious_Reconciliation_with_Losses_Duplications_and_Transfers","325725926_An_Integrated_Reconciliation_Framework_for_Domain_Gene_and_Species_Level_Evolution","295856189_EcceTERA_Comprehensive_gene_tree-species_tree_reconciliation_using_parsimony","11802829_Horizontal_Gene_Transfer_In_Prokaryotes_Quantification_and_Classification1","8609536_Structure_function_and_evolution_of_multidomain_proteins","6537947_A_simulation_test_bed_for_hypotheses_of_genome_evolution"]}
