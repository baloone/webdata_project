{"id":"335510509_Edge_Computing_in_5G_A_Review","abstract":"5G is the next generation cellular network that aspires to achieve substantial improvement on quality of service, such as higher throughput and lower latency. Edge computing is an emerging technology that enables the evolution to 5G by bringing cloud capabilities near to the end users (or user equipment, UEs) in order to overcome the intrinsic problems of the traditional cloud, such as high latency and the lack of security. In this paper, we establish a taxonomy of edge computing in 5G, which gives an overview of existing state-of-the-art solutions of edge computing in 5G on the basis of objectives, computational platforms, attributes, 5G functions, performance measures, and roles. We also present other important aspects, including the key requirements for its successful deployment in 5G and the applications of edge computing in 5G. Then, we explore, highlight, and categorize recent advancements in edge computing for 5G. By doing so, we reveal the salient features of different edge computing paradigms for 5G. Finally, open research issues are outlined.","authors":["Najmul Hassan","Kok-Lim Alvin Yau","Celimuge Wu"],"meta":["August 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2938534"],"references":["345573192_Green_and_Sustainable_Cloud_of_Things_Enabling_Collaborative_Edge_Computing","331362529_Edge_computing_A_survey","331326939_A_Survey_on_Vehicular_Edge_Computing_Architecture_Applications_Technical_Issues_and_Future_Directions","339563322_A_Lightweight_and_Privacy-Preserving_Authentication_Protocol_for_Mobile_Edge_Computing","333066618_Guest_Editorial_5G_Tactile_Internet_An_Application_for_Industrial_Automation","332110696_Joint_Communication_Computation_Caching_and_Control_in_Big_Data_Multi-Access_Edge_Computing","331524067_Fog_Computing_for_5G_Tactile_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_QoE-Aware_Resource_Allocation_Model","331190110_D2D_Communications_Meet_Mobile_Edge_Computing_for_Enhanced_Computation_Capacity_in_Cellular_Networks","330592108_Integrated_Blockchain_and_Edge_Computing_Systems_A_Survey_Some_Research_Issues_and_Challenges","328859324_Taxonomy_of_Edge_Computing_Challenges_Opportunities_and_Data_Reduction_Methods_From_Hype_to_Reality"]}
