Data were collected during spring 2018 (13.3 weeks) and student's grades for the registered course and their grade point average (GPA) were recorded.\n\nResults\nFindings showed statistically significant increases in student grades in the experimental group. Predictability calculations also showed better achievement of learning outcomes if a blended learning with a flipped classroom design is continued to be used in the future.","authors":["Suhaila Halasa","Nimer Abusalim","Mohammad Rayyan","Rose Eva Constantino"],"meta":["March 2020Nursing Open 7(1)","DOI:10.1002/nop2.492"],"references":["331753970_Implementation_of_a_Blended_Learning_Model_in_Content-_Based_EFL_Curriculum","330935647_What_Do_We_Mean_by_Blended_Learning","330115381_Supporting_Blended_Learning_Using_Mobile_Instant_Messaging_Application_Its_Effectiveness_and_Limitations","328191879_Using_Virtual_Mobility_and_Digital_Storytelling_in_Blended_Learning_Analysing_Students'_Experiences","327335815_Effects_of_Smoking_Cessation_Intervention_Education_Program_Based_on_Blended_Learning_among_Nursing_Students_in_South_Korea","324521110_Create_a_fine_blend_An_examination_of_institutional_transition_to_blended_learning","331602732_Accounting_students'_choice_of_blended_learning_format_and_its_impact_on_performance_and_satisfaction","330115192_The_Effect_of_Blended_Learning_on_Student's_Learning_Achievement_and_Science_Process_Skills_in_Plant_Tissue_Culture_Course","325749299_A_Blended_Learning_Model_Used_to_Prepare_Saudi_Arabian_Doctoral_Students_to_Be_Knowledge-Based_Educational_Leaders","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences"]}
