{"id":"269291460_Integration_of_conceptual_data_modeling_methods_Higher_education_experiences","abstract":"One of the most important phases in information system development is data modeling. In higher education and in professional environment, the basic data models are ER model, relational model and object oriented model, i.e. class diagram. Since conceptual modeling is crucial data modeling activity, special concern on methods for conceptual modeling is given in this paper. Case study shows that application of separate conceptual data modeling methods produce different and incomplete models. This leads to the conclusion that it is important to use integration of these methods and apply them within the information system development process. Educational experiences of applying this approach at University of Novi Sad, Technical faculty “Mihajlo Pupin” in Zrenjanin are presented as description of class exercises and exams results.","authors":["Ljubica Kazi","Biljana Radulovic","Ivana Franja Berkovic","Zoltan Kazi"],"meta":["May 2014","DOI:10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859685","Conference: 2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)"],"references":["279748704_Business_Process_Model_and_Elements_Of_Software_Design_The_Mapping_Approach","279748613_Applying_integration_of_conceptual_data_modelling_methods_within_information_system_development_A_case_study","279748404_Evaluation_of_Students'_Work_on_Data_Modeling_-Teaching_Improvement_Implications","261424940_Data_warehouse_based_evaluation_of_students'_achievements_in_information_systems_education","284757426_The_entity-relationship_model-toward_a_unified_data","277449491_The_role_of_domain_ontologies_in_database_design","264922728_Fundamentals_of_Database_Systems","247931221_Database_systems_-_the_complete_book_2_ed","243450254_Information_systems_development_methodologies","242381771_Fundamentals_of_Database_Systems"]}
