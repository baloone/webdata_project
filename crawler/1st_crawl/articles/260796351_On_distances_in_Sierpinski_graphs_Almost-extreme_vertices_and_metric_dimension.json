{"id":"260796351_On_distances_in_Sierpinski_graphs_Almost-extreme_vertices_and_metric_dimension","abstract":"Sierpi\\'nski graphs $S_p^n$ form an extensively studied family of graphs\nof fractal nature applicable in topology, mathematics of the Tower of Hanoi,\ncomputer science, and elsewhere. An almost-extreme vertex of $S_p^n$ is\nintroduced as a vertex that is either adjacent to an extreme vertex of\n$S_p^n$ or is incident to an edge between two subgraphs of $S_p^{n}$\nisomorphic to $S_p^{n-1}$. Explicit formulas are given for the\ndistance in $S_p^{n}$ between an arbitrary vertex and an almost-extreme\nvertex. The formulas are applied to compute the total distance of\nalmost-extreme vertices and to obtain the metric dimension of Sierpi\\'nski graphs.","authors":["Sara Sabrina Zemljič","Sandi Klavžar"],"meta":["April 2013Applicable Analysis and Discrete Mathematics 7:72-82","DOI:10.2298/AADM130109001K"],"references":["266988884_On_some_metric_properties_of_the_Sierpinski_graphs_Snk","228641769_Base_size_metric_dimension_and_other_invariants_of_groups_and_graphs","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","278170632_Metric_properties_of_the_Tower_of_Hanoi_graphs_and_Stem's_diatomic_sequence","268676844_Fractals_and_Universal_Spaces_in_Dimension_Theory","268068587_On_the_Wiener_Index_and_Circumference","267178777_The_metric_dimension_of_Cartesian_products_of_graphs","265307905_P_r_-free_colorings_of_Sierpinski-like_graphs","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","251556739_Coloring_Hanoi_and_Sierpiski_graphs"]}
