{"id":"322403736_Career_motivation_of_secondary_students_in_STEM_a_cross-cultural_study_between_Korea_and_Indonesia","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to understand the career motivation of secondary students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by comparing Korean and Indonesian students. Effects of gender and educational level on studentsâ€™ STEM career motivation were also examined. To test for differences, we used Rasch analysis, 3-way ANOVA, correlation analysis, and multiple group path analysis. STEM career motivation was found to be significantly affected by interactions between country, gender, and educational level. Overall, Indonesian students had more STEM career motivation than Korean students. Korean students showed larger gender differences in STEM career motivation than Indonesian students.","authors":["Sein Shin","Arif Rachmatullah","Fenny Roshayanti","Minsu Ha"],"meta":["July 2018International Journal for Educational and Vocational Guidance 18(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10775-017-9355-0"],"references":["312564834_Influence_of_Career_Motivation_on_Science_Learning_in_Korean_High-School_Students","305289735_RacialEthnic_and_Gender_Equity_Patterns_in_Illinois_High_School_Career_and_Technical_Education_Coursework","305063165_STEM_country_comparisons_international_comparisons_of_science_technology_engineering_and_mathematics_STEM_education_Final_report","301314562_The_Development_and_Validation_of_Instrument_for_Measuring_High_School_Students'_STEM_Career_Motivation","290478335_Gender_Gap_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_STEM_Current_Knowledge_Implications_for_Practice_Policy_and_Future_Directions","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","312296223_Applying_the_Rasch_Model_Fundamental_Measurement_in_the_Human_Sciences","292395766_Boosting_STEM_interest_in_high_school_A_project_at_Michigan_State_University_shows_how_public_high_schools_can_influence_the_number_of_students_headed_toward_STEM_careers","292313296_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Human_Motivation","286962709_A_qualitative_investigation_of_factors_promoting_the_retention_and_persistence_of_students_of_color_in_STEM"]}
