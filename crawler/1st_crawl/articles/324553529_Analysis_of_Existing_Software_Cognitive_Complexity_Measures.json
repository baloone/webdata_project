{"id":"324553529_Analysis_of_Existing_Software_Cognitive_Complexity_Measures","abstract":"In order to maintain the quality of software, it is important to measure it complexity. This provides an insight into the degree of comprehensibility and maintainability of the software. Measurement can be carried out using cognitive measures which are based on cognitive informatics. A number of such measures have been proposed in literature. The goal of this article is to identify the features and advantages of the existing measures. In addition, a comparative analysis is done based on some selected criteria. The results show that there is a similar trend in the output obtained from the different measures when they are applied to different examples. This makes it easy for adopting organisations to readily choose from the options based on the availability of tool support.","authors":["Sanjay Misra","Adewole Adewumi","Robertas Damasevicius","Rytis Maskeliunas"],"meta":["October 2017International Journal of Secure Software Engineering 8(4):51-71","DOI:10.4018/IJSSE.2017100103","Project: Software Quality Assurances through Software Metrics"],"references":["316906798_Cognitive_complexity_A_model_for_distributing_equivalent_programming_problems","291110677_Complexity_measurement_A_new_approach_to_ensure_equal_distribution_of_programming_problems_for_evaluation","290039568_Unified_complexity_measure_A_measure_of_complexity","289967557_A_metric_for_global_software_development_environment","267387521_A_New_Weighted_Composite_Complexity_Measure_for_Object-Oriented_Systems","260649701_Framework_for_evaluation_and_validation_of_software_complexity_measures","319366657_Analysis_and_enhancements_of_a_cognitive_based_complexity_measure","261449498_Applicability_of_three_complexity_metrics","261072361_A_metric_suite_for_early_estimation_of_software_testing_effort_using_requirement_engineering_document_and_its_validation","258967180_Goalquestionmetric_paradigm"]}
