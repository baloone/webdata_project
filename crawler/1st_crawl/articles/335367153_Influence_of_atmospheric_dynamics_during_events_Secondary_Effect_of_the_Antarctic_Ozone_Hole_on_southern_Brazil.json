{"id":"335367153_Influence_of_atmospheric_dynamics_during_events_Secondary_Effect_of_the_Antarctic_Ozone_Hole_on_southern_Brazil","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to show how atmospheric dynamics behave during the occurrence of ozone-hole inflow events in Antarctica, especially in mid-latitude regions, such as southern Brazil, for 12 years of observation. The results showed that most events occur after the frontal systems pass through mid-latitude regions, highlighting the importance of this study for the southern region of Brazil.
