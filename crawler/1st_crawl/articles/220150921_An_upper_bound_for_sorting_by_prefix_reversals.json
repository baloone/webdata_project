{"id":"220150921_An_upper_bound_for_sorting_by_prefix_reversals","abstract":"The pancake problem asks for the minimum number of prefix reversals sufficient for sorting any permutation of length n. We improve the upper bound for the pancake problem to (18/11)n+O(1)â‰ˆ(1.6363)n.","authors":["Bhadrachalam Chitturi","William Fahle","Z.
