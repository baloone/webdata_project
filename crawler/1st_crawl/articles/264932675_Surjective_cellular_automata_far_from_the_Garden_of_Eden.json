{"id":"264932675_Surjective_cellular_automata_far_from_the_Garden_of_Eden","abstract":"Automata, Logic and Semantics\nInternational audience\nOne of the first and most famous results of cellular automata theory, Moore's Garden-of-Eden theorem has been proven to hold if and only if the underlying group possesses the measure-theoretic properties suggested by von Neumann to be the obstacle to the Banach-Tarski paradox. We show that several other results from the literature, already known to characterize surjective cellular automata in dimension d, hold precisely when the Garden-of-Eden theorem does. We focus in particular on the balancedness theorem, which has been proven by Bartholdi to fail on amenable groups, and we measure the amount of such failure.","authors":["Silvio Capobianco","Pierre Guillon","Jarkko Kari"],"meta":["October 2013Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS 15(3)","DOI:10.46298/dmtcs.618"],"references":["264994761_1_Algorithmic_Randomness_and_Complexity","243118633_Gardens_of_Eden_and_amenability_on_cellular_automata","302338124_Finitely_Generated_Groups","274170178_Computable_Algebra_General_Theory_and_Theory_of_Computable_Fields","265681744_Hyperbolic_Groups","264996626_Amenable_groups_and_cellular_automata","246740320_Machine_Models_of_Self-Reproduction_in_Burks","244444514_The_converse_of_Moore's_Garden-of-Eden_theorem","239656351_Information_and_Randomness_An_Algorithmic_Perspective","238867355_Shorter_Note_The_Converse_of_Moore's_Garden-of-Eden_Theorem"]}
