{"id":"339820487_Industry_40_How_it_is_defined_from_a_sociotechnical_perspective_and_how_much_sustainability_it_includes_-_A_literature_review","abstract":"Industry 4.0 has had a strong influence on the debate on the digitalization of industrial processes, despite being criticized for lacking a proper definition. However, Industry 4.0 might offer a huge chance to align the goals of a sustainable development with the ongoing digital transformation in industrial development. The main contribution of this paper is therefore twofold. We provide a de-facto definition of the concept “Industry 4.0” from a sociotechnical perspective based on its most often cited key features, as well as a thorough review of how far the concept of sustainability is incorporated in it.","authors":["Grischa Beier","André Ullrich","Silke Niehoff","Malte Reißig"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Cleaner Production 259:120856","DOI:10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120856","Project: Digitalisation & Sustainability"],"references":["319894771_Review_of_Socio-technical_Considerations_to_Ensure_Successful_Implementation_of_Industry_40","309341485_Holistic_Approach_for_Human_Resource_Management_in_Industry_40","309026293_Smart_Product_Design_and_Production_Control_for_Effective_Mass_Customization_in_the_Industry_40_Concept","307620022_A_Maturity_Model_for_Assessing_Industry_40_Readiness_and_Maturity_of_Manufacturing_Enterprises","307619591_A_Categorical_Framework_of_Manufacturing_for_Industry_40_and_Beyond","347355320_China's_manufacturing_locus_in_2025_With_a_comparison_of_Made-in-China_2025_and_Industry_40","334083911_A_conceptual_model_of_knowledge_dynamics_in_the_industry_40_smart_grid_scenario","311780403_A_review_of_essential_standards_and_patent_landscapes_for_the_Internet_of_Things_A_key_enabler_for_Industry_40","304293566_Industry_40_Towards_future_industrial_opportunities_and_challenges","303288128_Tangible_Industry_40_a_scenario-based_approach_to_learning_for_the_future_of_production"]}
