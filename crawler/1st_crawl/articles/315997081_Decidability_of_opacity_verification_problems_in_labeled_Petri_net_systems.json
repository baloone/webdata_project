{"id":"315997081_Decidability_of_opacity_verification_problems_in_labeled_Petri_net_systems","abstract":"A system is said to be opaque if an intruder that observes its evolution through a mask cannot infer that the systemâ€™s evolution belongs to a given secret behavior. Opacity verification is the problem of determining whether the system is opaque with respect to a given secret or not. In this paper we address the decidability of the opacity verification problem. Using reduction approaches, we show that verification of initial-state, current-state, and language opacity is undecidable in labeled Petri nets.","authors":["Yin Tong","Zhiwu Li","Carla Seatzu","Alessandro Giua"],"meta":["June 2017Automatica 80:48-53","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2017.01.013","Project: Optimal liveness-enforcing supervisors for automated manufacturing systems by structural analysis of Petri nets."],"references":["294873311_Overview_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_Opacity_models_validation_and_quantification","283670260_On_the_Equivalence_of_Observation_Structures_for_Petri_Net_Generators","282924092_Verification_of_current-state_opacity_using_Petri_nets","271640261_Enforcement_and_Validation_at_runtime_of_Various_Notions_of_Opacity","309441959_Verification_of_State-Based_Opacity_Using_Petri_Nets","305909240_Verification_of_language-based_opacity_in_Petri_nets_using_verifier","304456732_Supervisory_enforcement_of_current-state_opacity_with_uncomparable_observations","284183856_Verification_of_Initial-State_Opacity_in_Petri_Nets","260909856_Synthesis_of_insertion_functions_for_enforcement_of_opacity_security_properties","257555732_Comparative_analysis_of_related_notions_of_opacity_in_centralized_and_coordinated_architectures"]}
