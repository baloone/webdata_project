{"id":"282535908_Teachers_Perception_on_Collaborative_Learning_Processes_Experiencing_Continuing_Teacher_Education_in_Brazil","abstract":"This paper examines the experience of a distance-training course for 250 Brazilians mathematics teachers, developed by the School of Education of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP - Brazil). Such program uses a LMS developed with focus on a collaborative learning methodology. We discuss the data related to technological tools evaluated by students as critical as the role of the tutor. Questionnaires were applied to obtain data and the results were analysed through content and frequency response. The results show that participants considered essential to solve problems together and indicated the importance of interactive spaces where educational professionals share experiences. Also, the tutor's skill can significantly contribute inside the LMS, becoming a mediator to the process by using this methodology.","authors":["MÃ´nica Cristina Garbin","Marta Fernandes Garcia","Sergio Amaral","Dirceu da Silva"],"meta":["June 2015Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 191:2231-2235","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.431","Project: Teacher Training"],"references":["248606839_Supporting_online_collaboration_Drawing_guidelines_from_an_empirical_study_on_E-Tutors","224764068_Exclusao_intra-escolar_nas_escolas_publicas_brasileiras_um_estudo_com_dados_da_Prova_Brasil_2005_2007_e_2009","308053280_Analise_de_Conteudo","249401889_A_Reference_Model_for_Sustainable_E-Learning_Service_SystemsExperiences_with_the_Joint_UniversityTeradata_Consortium","233966604_Rediseno_de_la_practica_pedagogica_factores_condiciones_y_procesos_de_cambio_en_los_teleformadores","223325370_Assessing_process_in_CSCL_An_ontological_approach","221521687_Apply_Web_20_Tools_to_Constructive_Collaboration_Learning_A_Case_Study_in_MIS_Course","220140248_A_pilot_study_of_cooperative_programming_learning_behavior_and_its_relationship_with_students'_learning_performance"]}
