{"id":"325510209_Genetic_tool_development_and_systemic_regulation_in_biosynthetic_technology","abstract":"With the increased development in research, innovation, and policy interest in recent years, biosynthetic technology has developed rapidly, which combines engineering, electronics, computer science, mathematics, and other disciplines based on classical genetic engineering and metabolic engineering. It gives a wider perspective and a deeper level to perceive the nature of life via cell mechanism, regulatory networks, or biological evolution. Currently, synthetic biology has made great breakthrough in energy, chemical industry, and medicine industries, particularly in the programmable genetic control at multiple levels of regulation to perform designed goals. In this review, the most advanced and comprehensive developments achieved in biosynthetic technology were represented, including genetic engineering as well as synthetic genomics. In addition, the superiority together with the limitations of the current genome-editing tools were summarized.","authors":["Zhongxue Dai","Shangjie Zhang","Qiao Yang","Wenming Zhang"],"meta":["June 2018Biotechnology for Biofuels 11(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13068-018-1153-5","Project: Biofuels"],"references":["320953077_Transcriptional_and_Post-Transcriptional_Mechanisms_of_the_Development_of_Neocortical_Lamination","320221942_Improved_conversion_of_ginsenoside_Rb1_to_compound_K_by_semi-rational_design_of_Sulfolobus_solfataricus_b-glycosidase","318099419_Tracking_the_emergence_of_synthetic_biology","316782762_Strategies_for_improved_isopropanol-butanol_production_by_a_Clostridium_strain_from_glucose_and_hemicellulose_through_consolidated_bioprocessing","316309944_Genome-Wide_Abolishment_of_Mobile_Genetic_Elements_Using_Genome_Shuffling_and_CRISPRCas-Assisted_MAGE_Allows_the_Efficient_Stabilization_of_a_Bacterial_Chassis","320199547_A_review_on_environmental_monitoring_of_water_organic_pollutants_identified_by_EU_guidelines","319636400_Systematic_Optimization_of_L_-Tryptophan_Riboswitches_for_Efficient_Monitoring_of_the_Metabolite_in_Escherichia_coli_Optimization_Strategies_for_Riboswitches","318751531_Development_of_Artificial_Riboswitches_for_Monitoring_of_Naringenin_In_Vivo","318664170_A_Synthetic_Circuit_for_Mercury_Bioremediation_Using_Self-Assembling_Functional_Amyloids","317078239_Engineering_RGB_color_vision_into_Escherichia_coli"]}
