{"id":"320140500_A_Substructural_Modal_Logic_of_Utility","abstract":"We introduce a substructural modal logic of utility that can be used to reason about optimality with respect to properties of states. Our notion of state is quite general, and is able to represent resource allocation problems in distributed systems. The underlying logic is a variant of the modal logic of bunched implications, and based on resource semantics, which is closely related to concurrent separation logic. We consider a labelled transition semantics and establish conditions under which Hennessy-Milner soundness and completeness hold. By considering notions of cost, strategy and utility, we are able to formulate characterizations of Pareto optimality, best responses, and Nash equilibrium within resource semantics.We also show that our logic is able to serve as a logic for a fully featured process algebra and explain the interaction between utility and the structure of processes.
