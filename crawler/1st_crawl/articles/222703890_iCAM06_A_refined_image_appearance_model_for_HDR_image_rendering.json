{"id":"222703890_iCAM06_A_refined_image_appearance_model_for_HDR_image_rendering","abstract":"A new image appearance model, designated iCAM06, was developed for High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) image rendering. The model, based on the iCAM framework, incorporates the spatial processing models in the human visual system for contrast enhancement, photoreceptor light adaptation functions that enhance local details in highlights and shadows, and functions that predict a wide range of color appearance phenomena. Evaluation of the model proved iCAM06 to have consistently good HDR rendering performance in both preference and accuracy making iCAM06 a good candidate for a general-purpose tone-mapping operator with further potential applications to a wide-range of image appearance research and practice.","authors":["Jiangtao Kuang","Garrett M.
