{"id":"351880698_Prediction_of_Diseases_in_Smart_Health_Care_System_using_Machine_Learning","abstract":": The main aim of this paper is to discuss about the use of Data mining in the field of Medical health care. These data mining techniques can be used in various fields of Research and Education also. The Smart Health Prediction System Is the Fastest emerging area in the field of medical science. Data mining is one of the fields of computer science that uses the existing data in medical field to predict the occurrence of diseases. By the use of machine learning and database management tools we can extract new patterns from group of large datasets and gain knowledge. In the following paper the survey is made on how the data mining techniques are used along with the machine learning to predict the diseases based on the user symptoms.","authors":["Divya Gopu"],"meta":["May 2021International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering 8(5)","DOI:10.35940/ijrte.E6482.018520"],"references":["349548570_Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_Data_Mining_Techniques","288888500_Comparative_Study_of_Chronic_Kidney_Disease_Prediction_using_KNN_and_SVM","331043835_Heart_disease_prediction_using_data_mining_with_mapreduce_algorithm","8357205_Application_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_to_Healthcare_Data"]}
