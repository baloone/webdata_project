{"id":"333431379_Depth-4_Lower_Bounds_Determinantal_Complexity_A_Unified_Approach","abstract":"Tavenas (Proceedings of mathematical foundations of computer science (MFCS), 2013) has recently proved that any \\(n^{O(1)}\\)-variate and degree n polynomial in \\(\\mathsf {VP}\\) can be computed by a depth-4\n\\(\\Sigma \\Pi \\Sigma \\Pi \\)\ncircuit of size \\(2^{O(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)}\\). So, to prove \\(\\mathsf {VP}\\ne \\mathsf {VNP}\\) it is sufficient to show that an explicit polynomial in \\(\\mathsf {VNP}\\) of degree n requires \\(2^{\\omega (\\sqrt{n}\\log n)}\\) size depth-4 circuits. Soon after Tavenas’ result, for two different explicit polynomials, depth-4 circuit-size lower bounds of \\(2^{\\Omega (\\sqrt{n}\\log n)}\\) have been proved (see Kayal et al. in Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014b. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2591796.2591847; Fournier et al. in Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014). In particular, using a combinatorial design Kayal et al. (2014b) construct an explicit polynomial in \\(\\mathsf {VNP}\\) that requires depth-4 circuits of size \\(2^{\\Omega (\\sqrt{n}\\log n)}\\) and Fournier et al. (Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014) show that the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial (which is in \\(\\mathsf {VP}\\)) also requires \\(2^{\\Omega (\\sqrt{n}\\log n)}\\) size depth-4 circuits.In this paper, we identify a simple combinatorial property such that any polynomial f that satisfies this property would achieve a similar depth-4 circuit-size lower bound. In particular, it does not matter whether f is in \\(\\mathsf {VP}\\) or in \\(\\mathsf {VNP}\\). As a result, we get a simple unified lower-bound analysis for the above-mentioned polynomials.Another goal of this paper is to compare our current knowledge of the depth-4 circuit-size lower bounds and the determinantal complexity lower bounds. Currently, the best known determinantal complexity lower bound is \\(\\Omega (n^2)\\) for permanent of a \\(n\\times n\\) matrix (which is a \\(n^2\\)-variate and degree n polynomial) due to Cai et al. (Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2008). We prove that the determinantal complexity of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial is \\(\\Omega (dn)\\) where d is the number of matrices and n is the dimension of the matrices. In particular, our result settles the determinantal complexity of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial to \\(\\Theta (dn)\\). To the best of our knowledge, a \\(\\Theta (n)\\) bound for the determinantal complexity for the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial was known only for any constant \\(d>1\\), due to Jansen (Theory Comput Syst 49(2):343–354, 2011).","authors":["Suryajith Chillara","Partha Mukhopadhyay"],"meta":["December 2019computational complexity 28(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-019-00185-4"],"references":["330673386_Improved_bounds_for_reduction_to_depth_4_and_depth_3","288305314_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_Homogeneous_Depth_Four_Arithmetic_Formulas","288149370_A_super-polynomial_lower_bound_for_regular_arithmetic_formulas","261475105_On_the_Power_of_Homogeneous_Depth_4_Arithmetic_Circuits","261469588_Approaching_the_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","258884473_The_Limits_of_Depth_Reduction_for_Arithmetic_Formulas_It's_All_About_the_Top_Fan-In","248202984_Undergraduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","243766940_Classes_of_Arithmetic_Circuits_Capturing_the_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Determinant","242985067_On_two_extremal_matrix_problems","236248292_Improved_Bounds_for_Reduction_to_Depth_4_and_Depth_3","235008639_Hardness_vs_randomness","225330350_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Determinantal_Complexity_of_Explicit_Low_Degree_Polynomials","223710606_A_note_on_the_determinant_and_permanent_problem","222436692_Permanent_and_determinant","221591597_Completeness_Classes_in_Algebra"]}
