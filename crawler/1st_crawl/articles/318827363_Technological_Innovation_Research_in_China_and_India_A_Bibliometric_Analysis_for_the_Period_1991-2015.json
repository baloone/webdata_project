{"id":"318827363_Technological_Innovation_Research_in_China_and_India_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_for_the_Period_1991-2015","abstract":"Although a substantial literature on the management of technological innovation exists, several scholars argue that much of this research has been rooted in Western contexts, where key assumptions are very different from those in emerging economies. Building on this viewpoint, we investigate the current state of knowledge on technological innovation in two of the largest and fastest growing emerging economies: China and India. We undertook a bibliometric analysis of author keywords and combined different quantitative approaches – frequency analysis, cluster analysis, and co-word analysis – to review 162 articles on technological innovation published about China and India for the period 1991–2015. From the analyses, the trends in technological innovation research in the two countries and the dominant themes of discussion were identified. These themes were further classified into eight sub-themes. Our key findings indicate a near absence of research on the management of technological innovation based on India, limited volume of research on indigenous aspects of innovation, and a lack of theory-building based on these countries’ contexts. Several suggestions for future research are offered based on the gaps identified.","authors":["Debabrata Chatterjee","Sreevas Sahasranamam"],"meta":["March 2018Management and Organization Review forthcoming(1)","DOI:10.1017/mor.2017.46","Project: Entrepreneurship/innovation in and from emerging markets"],"references":["345012390_Levels_of_Analysis_in_Entrepreneurship_Research_Current_Research_Practice_and_Suggestions_for_the_Future","344099660_Social_Innovation_and_Entrepreneurship","331946128_The_Silicon_Valley-Hsinchu_Connection_Technical_Communities_and_Industrial_Upgrading","325003897_International_Diversification_Effects_on_Innovation_and_Firm_Performance_in_Product-Diversified_Firms","325003176_1_Moving_Beyond_Schumpeter_Management_Research_on_the_Determinants_of_Technological_Innovation","325003080_Social_Capital_and_Value_Creation_The_Role_of_Intrafirm_Networks","324989126_Knowledge_Transfer_in_Intraorganizational_Networks_Effects_of_Network_Position_and_Absorptive_Capacity_on_Business_Unit_Innovation_and_Performance","324987698_Dynamic_Inducements_in_RD_Investment_Market_Signals_and_Network_Locations","324986022_A_Multidimensional_Model_of_Venture_Growth","318601919_Corporate_Entrepreneurship_Innovation"]}
