{"id":"326367528_Image_segmentation_applied_to_satellite_imagery_for_monitoring_water_in_lakes_and_reservoirs","abstract":"Here we show that a method of image processing, an image segmentation recently developed and used for the analyses of micrographs, can be applied to the monitoring of the water in lakes and reservoirs by means of the related satellite imagery. The image segmentation allows measuring surfaces and perimeters of the inundated basins. Here the segmentation is applied to the Sarygamysh Lake in Central Asia.","authors":["Amelia Carolina Sparavigna"],"meta":["January 2018Philica"],"references":["321572582_Measuring_the_blood_cells_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","321209886_An_image_segmentation_for_the_measurement_of_microstructures_in_ductile_cast_iron","321049043_Image_Segmentation_Applied_to_the_Analysis_of_Fabric_Textures","319537882_Measuring_the_particles_in_fly_ash_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","319537185_Measuring_the_size_of_tubules_in_phloem_and_xylem_of_plants","317179916_The_role_of_land_use_change_on_the_sustainability_of_groundwater_resources_in_the_eastern_plains_of_Kurdistan_Iran","313569115_Image_segmentation_applied_to_micrographs_of_microcellular_plastics","311737982_Analysis_of_a_natural_honeycomb_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","311430540_A_method_for_the_segmentation_of_images_based_on_thresholding_and_applied_to_vesicular_textures","306064813_Changes_in_irrigated_land_and_agricultural_water_use_in_the_Lake_Urmia_basin"]}
