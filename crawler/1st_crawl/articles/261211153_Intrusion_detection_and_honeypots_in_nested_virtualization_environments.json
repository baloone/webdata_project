{"id":"261211153_Intrusion_detection_and_honeypots_in_nested_virtualization_environments","abstract":"Several research projects in the past have built intrusion detection systems and honeypot architectures based on virtual machine introspection (VMI). These systems directly benefit from the use of virtualization technology. The VMI approach, however, requires direct interaction with the virtual machine monitor, and typically is not available to clients of current public clouds. Recently, nested virtualization has gained popularity in research as an approach that could enable cloud customers to use virtualization-based solutions within a cloud by nesting two virtual machine monitors, with the inner one under control of the client. In this paper, we compare the performance of existing nested-virtualization solutions and analyze the impact of the performance overhead on VMI-based intrusion detection and honeypot systems.","authors":["Michael Beham","Marius Vlad","Hans P.
