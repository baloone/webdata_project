{"id":"353443669_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_Based_on_Superpixel_Pooling_Convolutional_Neural_Network_with_Transfer_Learning","abstract":"Deep learning‐based hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has attracted more and more attention because of its excellent classification ability. Generally, the outstanding performance of these methods mainly depends on a large number of labeled samples. Therefore, it still remains an ongoing challenge how to integrate spatial structure information into these frameworks to classify the HSI with limited training samples. In this study, an effective spectral‐spatial HSI classification scheme is proposed based on superpixel pooling convolutional neural network with transfer learning (SP‐CNN). The suggested method includes three stages. The first part consists of convolution and pooling operation, which is a down‐sampling process to extract the main spectral features of an HSI. The second part is composed of up‐sampling and superpixel (homogeneous regions with adaptive shape and size) pooling to explore the spatial structure information of an HSI. Finally, the hyperspectral data with each superpixel as a basic input rather than a pixel are fed to fully connected neural network. In this method, the spectral and spatial information is effectively fused by using superpixel pooling technique. The use of popular transfer learning technology in the proposed classification framework significantly improves the training efficiency of SP‐CNN. To evaluate the effectiveness of the SP‐CNN, extensive experiments were conducted on three common real HSI datasets acquired from different sensors. With 30 labeled pixels per class, the overall classification accuracy provided by this method on three benchmarks all exceeded 93%, which was at least 4.55% higher than that of several state‐of‐the‐art approaches. Experimental and comparative results prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively classify the HSI with limited training labels.","authors":["Fuding Xie","Quanshan Gao","Cui Jin","Fengxia
