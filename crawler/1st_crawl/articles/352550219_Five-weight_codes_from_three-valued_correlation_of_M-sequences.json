Their Lee weight distribution is computed by using character sums. Their support structure is determined. An application to secret sharing schemes is given. The parameters of the binary image are \\begin{document}$ [2^{m+1}(2^m-1),4m,2^{m}(2^m-2^r)] $\\end{document} for some explicit \\begin{document}$ r. $\\end{document}","authors":["Minjia Shi","Liqin Qian","Tor Helleseth","Patrick Sol√©"],"meta":["January 2021Advances in Mathematics of Communications","DOI:10.3934/amc.2021022"],"references":["335832810_Optimal_Two-Weight_Codes_From_Trace_Codes_Over_F2uF2","331811907_Three-weight_codes_triple_sum_sets_and_strongly_walk_regular_graphs","320693074_New_Classes_of_p-Ary_Few_Weight_Codes","311648118_New_few_weight_codes_from_trace_codes_over_a_local_Ring","311430326_Some_ternary_cubic_two-weight_codes","324921881_FEW-WEIGHT_CODES_FROM_TRACE_CODES_OVER","320274917_Two-weight_and_three-weight_codes_from_trace_codes_over_F_p_u_F_p_v_F_p_u_v_F_p","312236880_Optimal_binary_codes_from_trace_codes_over_a_non-chain_ring","311430484_Two_New_Families_of_Two-Weight_Codes","309081987_Optimal_two_weight_codes_over_mathbbF_2umathbbF_2","268895457_Signal_design_for_good_correlation_For_wireless_communication_cryptography_and_radar","266043689_Two-Weight_Codes_Punctured_from_Irreducible_Cyclic_Codes","265563486_Sequences_with_low_correlation","256711415_A_class_of_optimal_p-ary_codes_from_one-weight_codes_over_FpuumFpuum","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes"]}
