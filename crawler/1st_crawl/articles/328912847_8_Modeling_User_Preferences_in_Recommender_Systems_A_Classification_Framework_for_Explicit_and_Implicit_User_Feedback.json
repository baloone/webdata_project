{"id":"328912847_8_Modeling_User_Preferences_in_Recommender_Systems_A_Classification_Framework_for_Explicit_and_Implicit_User_Feedback","abstract":"Recommender systems are firmly established as a standard technology for assisting users with their choices; however, little attention has been paid to the application of the user model in recommender systems, particularly the variability and noise that are an intrinsic part of human behavior and activity. To enable recommender systems to suggest items that are useful to a particular user, it can be essential to understand the user and his or her interactions with the system. These interactions typically manifest themselves as explicit and implicit user feedback that provides the key indicators for modeling users' preferences for items and essential information for personalizing recommendations. In this article, we propose a classification framework for the use of explicit and implicit user feedback in recommender systems based on a set of distinct properties that include Cognitive Effort, User Model, Scale of Measurement, and Domain Relevance. We develop a set of comparison criteria for explicit and implicit user feedback to emphasize the key properties. Using our framework, we provide a classification of recommender systems that have addressed questions about user feedback, and we review state-of-the-art techniques to improve such user feedback and thereby improve the performance of the recommender system. Finally, we formulate challenges for future research on improvement of user feedback.","authors":["Gawesh Jawaheer","Peter Weller","Patty Kostkova"],"meta":["May 2014ACM Transactions on Information and System Security 2(4):26 pages"],"references":["251572415_What_impact_do_healthcare_digital_libraries_have_An_evaluation_of_national_resource_of_infection_control_at_the_point_of_care_using_the_Impact-ED_framework","242104348_Item-based_top-_N_recommendation_algorithms","313348661_Folksonomies_the_Semantic_Web_and_Movie_Recommendation","304494685_Probabilistic_matrix_factorization","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","260282866_Stats_We're_Doing_It_Wrong","236647056_How_to_Design_and_Report_Experiments","234794211_Recommender_Systems_Handbook","230875655_Mining_the_Real-Time_Web_A_Novel_Approach_to_Product_Recommendation"]}
