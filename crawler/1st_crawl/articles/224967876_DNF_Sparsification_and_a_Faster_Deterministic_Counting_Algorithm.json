{"id":"224967876_DNF_Sparsification_and_a_Faster_Deterministic_Counting_Algorithm","abstract":"Given a DNF formula on n variables, the two natural size measures are the\nnumber of terms or size s(f), and the maximum width of a term w(f). It is\nfolklore that short DNF formulas can be made narrow. We prove a converse,\nshowing that narrow formulas can be sparsified. More precisely, any width w DNF\nirrespective of its size can be $\\epsilon$-approximated by a width $w$ DNF with\nat most $(w\\log(1/\\epsilon))^{O(w)}$ terms.\nWe combine our sparsification result with the work of Luby and Velikovic to\ngive a faster deterministic algorithm for approximately counting the number of\nsatisfying solutions to a DNF. Given a formula on n variables with poly(n)\nterms, we give a deterministic $n^{\\tilde{O}(\\log \\log(n))}$ time algorithm\nthat computes an additive $\\epsilon$ approximation to the fraction of\nsatisfying assignments of f for $\\epsilon = 1/\\poly(\\log n)$. The previous best\nresult due to Luby and Velickovic from nearly two decades ago had a run-time of\n$n^{\\exp(O(\\sqrt{\\log \\log n}))}$.","authors":["Parikshit Gopala","Raghu Meka","Omer Reingold"],"meta":["May 2012computational complexity 22(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-013-0068-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258387533_Communication_and_Memory_Architecture_Design_of_Application-Specific_High-End_Multiprocessors","225670921_Reducing_the_complexity_of_reductions","223637491_Monte-Carlo_approximation_algorithms_for_enumeration_problems","221591872_On_Deterministic_Approximation_of_DNF","220442284_Boolean_Functions_With_Low_Average_Sensitivity_Depend_On_Few_Coordinates","220138268_On_Sunflowers_and_Matrix_Multiplication","4354999_Monte-Carlo_algorithms_for_enumeration_and_reliability_problems","2596505_Reducing_the_Complexity_of_Reductions","267482782_Polylogarithmic_Independence_Can_Fool_DNF_Formulas","265223791_Tight_Bounds_on_the_Average_Sensitivity_of_k-CNF","243733877_Intersection_Theorems_for_Systems_of_Sets","243034368_Intersection_Theorems_for_Systems_of_Sets_II","242807208_-Formulae_on_Finite_Structures","242500225_Learning_Boolean_Functions_via_the_Fourier_Transform","242356818_Z_formulae_on_finite_structures","239625945_A_Note_on_Approximate_Counting_for_k-DNF","235008639_Hardness_vs_randomness","234826393_Polylogarithmic_Independence_Fools_AC0_Circuits","234802744_A_Simple_Proof_of_Bazzi's_Theorem","225761534_Improved_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Depth_2_Circuits","225264758_Parity_circuits_and_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy","224871801_Open_Problems_in_Analysis_of_Boolean_Functions","224586730_Poly-logarithmic_Independence_Fools_AC0_Circuits","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","222076702_An_Onlog_log_n_Learning_Algorithm_for_DNF_under_the_Uniform_Distribution","221499599_Deterministic_Simulation_of_Probabilistic_Constant_Depth_Circuits_Preliminary_Version","221499169_Constant_Depth_Circuits_Fourier_Transform_and_Learnability","221498815_The_Monotone_Complexity_of_k-Clique_on_Random_Graphs","221462823_Improved_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Depth_2_Circuits","220689472_Extremal_combinatorics_With_applications_in_computer_science","220441383_Pseudorandom_bits_for_constant_depth_circuits","51989714_On_K-wise_Independent_Distributions_and_Boolean_Functions","4355018_Separating_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy_by_oracles","4355011_Deterministic_simulation_of_probabilistic_constant_depth_circuits","4294389_Polylogarithmic_Independence_Can_Fool_DNF_Formulas","3516091_Deterministic_approximate_counting_of_depth-2_circuits","2631399_Almost_Optimal_Lower_Bounds_for_Small_Depth_Circuits","2533378_Approximate_Inclusion-Exclusion","2329655_Small-Bias_Probability_Spaces_Efficient_Constructions_and_Applications"]}
