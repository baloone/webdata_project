{"id":"267264014_Voice_over_TCP_and_UDP","abstract":"We compare UDP and TCP when transmitting voice data using PlanetLab where we can do experiments globally. For TCP, we also do experiments using TCP NODELAY which sends out requests immediately. We compare the performance of different protocols by their 90 th percentile delay and jitter. The performance of UDP is better than that of TCP NODELAY and the performance TCP NODELAY is better than that of TCP. We also explore the relation between TCP delay time minus the transmission time and the packet loss rate and find there is a linear relationship between them.","authors":["Xiaotang Zhang","Henning Schulzrinne"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
