{"id":"267046644_Analysis_of_incremental_augmented_affine_projection_algorithm_for_distributed_estimation_of_complex_signals","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of distributed estimation in an incremental\nnetwork when the measurements taken by the node follow a widely linear model.\nThe proposed algorithm which we refer to it as incremental augmented affine\nprojection algorithm (incAAPA) utilizes the full second order statistical\ninformation in the complex domain. Moreover, it exploits spatio-temporal\ndiversity to improve the estimation performance. We derive steady-state\nperformance metric of the incAAPA in terms of the mean-square deviation (MSD).\nWe further derive sufficient conditions to ensure mean-square convergence. Our\nanalysis illustrate that the proposed algorithm is able to process both second\norder circular (proper) and noncircular (improper) signals. The validity of the\ntheoretical results and the good performance of the proposed algorithm are\ndemonstrated by several computer simulations.","authors":["Azam Khalili","Wael M.
