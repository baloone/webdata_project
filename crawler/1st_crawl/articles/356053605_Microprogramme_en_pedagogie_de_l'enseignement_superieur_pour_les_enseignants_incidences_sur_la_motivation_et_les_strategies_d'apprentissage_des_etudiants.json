What are the impacts of this “long term” program? The purpose of this study is to verify the impact of this training program on the motivation and learning strategies of the students of teachers who received this training. Perceptual data collected from 252 students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds enrolled in six programs (enseignement préscolaire et primaire, enseignement collégial, politiques appliquées, chimie, informatique et génie) shows that teachers trained in higher education pedagogy offered lectures and activities that helped keep their students motivated throughout the semester. More specifically, the data reveal that teachers coming from the programs “enseignement préscolaire et primaire”, as well as “enseignement au collegial” have also used active learning that supports the development of contextualization, information selection and monitoring strategies in their students.","authors":["Mélanie Cabana","Denis Bédard"],"meta":["November 2021","DOI:10.4000/ripes.3599"],"references":["326616930_Student_Resistance_to_Collaborative_Learning","321821905_La_formation_pedagogique_des_nouveaux_professeurs_d'universite_ses_effets_a_court_terme","317797734_Student_Motivation_in_Response_to_Problem-based_Learning","317320823_Enseigner_la_psychologie_et_la_recherche_par_l'apprentissage_par_probleme_effets_sur_les_besoins_psychologiques_des_etudiants","314701446_Motivation_et_apprentissages_scolaires","292191890_La_formation_d'enseignants_universitaires_nouvellement_recrutes_quelles_retombees","339266111_How_Learning_Happens_Seminal_Works_in_Educational_Psychology_and_What_They_Mean_in_Practice","333159512_The_Wiley_Handbook_of_Problem-Based_Learning","325622291_Effets_de_la_formation_a_l'enseignement_sur_les_pratiques_des_nouveaux_enseignants-chercheurs","291223316_LEARNING_STRATEGIES_AN_OVERVIEW","283523837_Focusing_Teaching_on_Students_Examining_Student_Perceptions_of_Learning_Strategies","281345525_Motivational_Beliefs_Values_and_Goals","289963001_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Motivations_Classic_Definition_and_New_Directions","285485143_Faculty_development_in_Canadian_universities","281385583_Un_esprit_pour_apprendre"]}
