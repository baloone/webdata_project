{"id":"320141879_A_comparative_analysis_of_rainfall_prediction_models_using_artificial_neural_networks","abstract":"This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of different neural network models designed for rainfall prediction. In the course of this research, many training algorithms, input models network architectures, input data sets, methods to choose data for training and testing were employed. This led to the discovery of shortcomings in few models and methods to improve these models or alternatives for these models. In addition, Wavelet Neural Network based rainfall prediction model was used to check for any improvement in the performance of the prediction accuracy. As a result of the analysis of myriad combinations of the above said aspects, a better performing Wavelet ANN model for the prediction of rainfall, using segregation of input data set is found to be in good prediction accuracy.","authors":["Renuga devi Subramanian"],"meta":["October 2017Disaster Advances 10(10):44-53"],"references":["248606119_Neural_Networks_for_the_MSOR_Analyst_An_Application_Bibliography","227078976_Connectionist_approach_to_time_series_prediction_An_empirical_test","222489987_Forecasting_With_Artificial_Neural_Networks_The_State_of_the_Art","221620514_How_Neural_Nets_Work","220668844_Feedforward_Neural_Nets_as_Models_for_Time_Series_Forecasting","29630274_An_Artificial_neural_network_model_for_rainfall_forecasting_in_Bangkok_Thailand","267474212_Wavelet_Methods_for_Time_Series","233822447_Learning_Internal_Representation_by_Back-Propagation_Errors","223696185_Neural_network_forecasting_of_short_noisy_time_series","223587382_Long-term_memory_prediction_by_multiscale_decomposition","223512232_A_neural_network_short-term_load_forecaster","222819272_An_Artificial_Neural_Network_Model_for_Generating_Hydrograph_From_Hydro-Meteorological_Parameters","222195097_Short_Term_Streamflow_Forecasting_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks","220422075_Neural_Networks_Applications_in_Industry_Business_and_Science","3249749_An_Introduction_to_Computing_with_Neural_Nets"]}
