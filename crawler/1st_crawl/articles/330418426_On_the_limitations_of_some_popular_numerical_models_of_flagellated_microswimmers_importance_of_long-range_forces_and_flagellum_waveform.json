{"id":"330418426_On_the_limitations_of_some_popular_numerical_models_of_flagellated_microswimmers_importance_of_long-range_forces_and_flagellum_waveform","abstract":"For a sperm-cell-like flagellated swimmer in an unbounded domain, several numerical models of different fidelity are considered based on the Stokes flow approximation. The models include a regularized Stokeslet method and a three-dimensional finite-element method, which serve as the benchmark solutions for several approximate models considered. The latter include the resistive force theory versions of Lighthill, and Gray and Hancock, as well as a simplified approximation based on computing the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the head and the flagellum separately. It is shown how none of the simplified models is robust enough with regards to predicting the effect of the swimmer head shape change on the swimmer dynamics. For a range of swimmer motions considered, the resulting solutions for the swimmer force and velocities are analysed and the applicability of the Stokes model for the swimmers in question is probed.","authors":["Cecilia Rorai","M.
