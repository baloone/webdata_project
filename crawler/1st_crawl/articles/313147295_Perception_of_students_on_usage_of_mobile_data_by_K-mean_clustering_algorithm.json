Data has been collected through the survey data, this study comprises research questions based on the previous literature review and formulated hypotheses to check the tentative statements. Furthermore, collected data has been analysis using K-mean algorithm. Additionally, this study explore methodological gap using K-Mean clustering algorithm. The sample study consisted of 200 students in the department of computer science at Gomal and Qurtuba universities in Dere Ismail Khan \n\nPerception of students on usage of mobile data by K-mean clustering algorithm.
