{"id":"261165150_Turing_Machines_with_Atoms","abstract":"We study Turing machines over sets with atoms, also known as nominal sets. Our main result is that deterministic machines are weaker than nondeterministic ones; in particular, Pâ‰ NP in sets with atoms. Our main construction is closely related to the Cai-Furer-Immerman graphs used in descriptive complexity theory.","authors":["Mikolaj Bojanczyk","Bartek Klin","Slawomir Lasota","Szymon Torunczyk"],"meta":["June 2013Proceedings - Symposium on Logic in Computer Science","DOI:10.1109/LICS.2013.24","Conference: Logic in Computer Science (LICS), 2013 28th Annual IEEE/ACM Symposium on"],"references":["243080169_Stable_Finitely_Homogeneous_Structures","221602527_Algorithmic_Nominal_Game_Semantics","221557852_Nominal_Domain_Theory_for_Concurrency","311640717_Toward_model_theory_with_data_values","286971717_Imperative_programming_in_sets_with_atoms","268615024_Studies_in_Logic_and_the_Foundations_of_Mathematics","265802615_A_Machine-Independent_Characterization_of_Timed_Languages","262366963_Toward_Model_Theory_with_Data_Values","245215779_Admissible_Sets_and_Structures_An_Approach_to_Definability_Theory","245147611_The_Axiom_of_Choice","221499569_An_Optimal_Lower_Bound_on_the_Number_of_Variables_for_Graph_Identification","221442786_Automata_with_Group_Actions","220997519_Towards_Nominal_Computation","220442129_An_optimal_lower_bound_on_the_number_of_variables_for_graph_identifications","220102489_A_New_Approach_to_Abstract_Syntax_with_Variable_Binding"]}
