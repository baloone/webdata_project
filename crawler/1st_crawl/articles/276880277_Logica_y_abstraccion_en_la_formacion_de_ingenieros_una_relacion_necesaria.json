It describes the importance and the need for training in this area of knowledge and the relationship between professional exercise of the engineers and the development and/or potentiation of logical-interpretative and abstractive ability for problem solution. It is a research-review-reflection work about the importance of these two components, viewed structurally from the curriculum. It is the product of the first phase of the research “The capacity logical-interpretative and abstractive as a basic component for professional exercise of the engineers”.","authors":["Edgar Serna M.","Polo José Antonio"],"meta":["April 2014Ingeniería Investigación y Tecnología 15(2):299-310","DOI:10.1016/S1405-7743(14)72218-8"],"references":["247316940_Reflexion_and_Reflection_A_Social_Cognitive_Neuroscience_Approach_to_Attributional_Inference","345227265_Strategies_and_Knowledge_Representation","319395100_Psychology_Reasoning_Structure_and_Content","319394497_Handbook_of_Logic_in_Computer_Science","285605186_Students'_proof_schemes_research_on_collegiate_mathematics_education_vol_iii","279235259_The_Poetics_of_Mind_Figurative_Thought_Language_and_Understanding","277530267_On_the_Behavioral_Foundations_of_Mathematical_Concepts","261660523_Problem-Solving_Strategies","248283065_The_Psychology_of_The_Child","245744446_Computational_Models_of_Belief_and_the_Semantics_of_Belief_Sentences"]}
