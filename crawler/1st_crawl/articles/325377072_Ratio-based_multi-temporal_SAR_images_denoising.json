{"id":"325377072_Ratio-based_multi-temporal_SAR_images_denoising","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient multitemporal despeckling method. The key idea of the proposed approach is the use of the ratio image, provided by the ratio between an image and the temporal mean of the stack. This ratio image is easier to denoise than a single image thanks to its improved stationarity. Besides, temporally stable thin structures are well preserved thanks to the multitemporal mean. The proposed approach can be divided into three steps: 1) estimation of a \"superimage\" by temporal averaging and possibly spatial denoising; 2) denoising of the ratio between the noisy image of interest and the \"superimage\"; and 3) computation of the denoised image by remultiplying the denoised ratio by the \"superimage.\" Because of the improved spatial stationarity of the ratio images, denoising these ratio images with a speckle-reduction method is more effective than denoising images from the original multitemporal stack. The amount of data that is jointly processed is also reduced compared to other methods through the use of the \"superimage\" that sums up the temporal stack. The comparison with several state-of-the-art reference methods shows better results numerically (peak signal-noise-ratio and structure similarity index) as well as visually on simulated and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series. The proposed ratio-based denoising framework successfully extends single-image SAR denoising methods to time series by exploiting the persistence of many geometrical structures.","authors":["Weiying Zhao","Loic Denis","Charles Deledalle","Henri Maitre"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TGRS.2018.2885683","Project: speckle reduction"],"references":["317344121_SAR_Image_Despeckling_Using_a_Convolutional_Neural_Network","316283224_Unassisted_Quantitative_Evaluation_Of_Despeckling_Filters","306187437_Beyond_a_Gaussian_Denoiser_Residual_Learning_of_Deep_CNN_for_Image_Denoising","269117335_NL-SAR_a_unified_Non-Local_framework_for_resolution-preserving_PolInSAR_denoising","262231625_Adaptive_Multitemporal_SAR_Image_Filtering_Based_on_the_Change_Detection_Matrix","261498787_A_first_comparison_of_Cosmo-SkyMed_and_TerraSAR-X_data_over_Chamonix_Mont-Blanc_test-site","260982283_Exploiting_Patch_Similarity_for_SAR_Image_Processing_The_nonlocal_paradigm","257008464_A_Tutorial_on_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar","224574328_Iterative_Weighted_Maximum_Likelihood_Denoising_With_Probabilistic_Patch-Based_Weights","224122239_Multiplicative_Noise_Removal_Using_Variable_Splitting_and_Constrained_Optimization","6151802_Image_Denoising_by_Sparse_3-D_Transform-Domain_Collaborative_Filtering","3204087_Intensity-Driven-Adaptive-Neighborhood_Technique_for_Polarimetric_and_Interferometric_SAR_Parameters_Estimation","3202751_Filtering_of_multichannel_SAR_images","3202307_Multitemporal_ERS_SAR_analysis_applied_to_forest_mapping","328993829_RABASAR_A_Fast_Ratio_Based_Multi-Temporal_SAR_Despeckling","323064043_Subpixellic_Methods_for_Sidelobes_Suppression_and_Strong_Targets_Extraction_in_Single_Look_Complex_SAR_Images","321788382_SAR_image_despeckling_through_convolutional_neural_networks","317593574_Multitemporal_SAR_Image_Despeckling_Based_on_Block-Matching_and_Collaborative_Filtering","316234696_MuLoG_or_How_to_Apply_Gaussian_Denoisers_to_Multi-Channel_SAR_Speckle_Reduction","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","303890529_Multitemporal_SAR_Image_Decomposition_into_Strong_Scatterers_Background_and_Speckle","273640865_Change_detection_matrix_for_multitemporal_filtering_and_change_analysis_of_SAR_and_PolSAR_image_time_series","271539653_NORCAMA_Change_analysis_in_SAR_time_series_by_likelihood_ratio_change_matrix_clustering","262605036_Two-Step_Multitemporal_Nonlocal_Means_for_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Images","260622584_A_Tutorial_on_Speckle_Reduction_in_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Images","260603761_MIMOSA_An_automatic_change_detection_method_for_sar_time_series","257468681_Multiresolution_Adaptive_Image_Smoothing","239063495_Understanding_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Images","231377383_A_Nonlocal_SAR_image_denoising_algorithm_based_on_LLMMSE_wavelet_shrinkage","229310027_Speckle_analysis_and_smoothing_of_synthetic_aperture_radar_images","228361845_Introduction_to_Second_Kind_Statistics_Application_of_Log-Moments_and_Log-Cumulants_to_Analysis_of_Radar_Images","215930263_Speckle_Phenomena_in_Optics_Theory_and_Applications","5487316_Adaptive-Neighborhood_Speckle_Removal_in_Multitemporal_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Images","3856889_Time-space_filtering_of_multitemporal_SAR_images","3203610_A_new_statistical_model_for_Markovian_classification_of_Urban_areas_in_high-Resolution_SAR_images","3203033_A_review_of_speckle_filtering_in_the_context_of_estimation_Theory","3200939_Speckle_reduction_in_multipolarization_multifrequency_SAR_imagery"]}
