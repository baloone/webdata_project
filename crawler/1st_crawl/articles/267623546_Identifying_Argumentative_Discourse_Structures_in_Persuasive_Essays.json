{"id":"267623546_Identifying_Argumentative_Discourse_Structures_in_Persuasive_Essays","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel ap-proach for identifying argumentative dis-course structures in persuasive essays. The structure of argumentation consists of sev-eral components (i.e. claims and premises) that are connected with argumentative re-lations. We consider this task in two consecutive steps. First, we identify the components of arguments using multiclass classification. Second, we classify a pair of argument components as either support or non-support for identifying the struc-ture of argumentative discourse. For both tasks, we evaluate several classifiers and propose novel feature sets including struc-tural, lexical, syntactic and contextual fea-tures. In our experiments, we obtain a macro F1-score of 0.726 for identifying argument components and 0.722 for argu-mentative relations.","authors":["Christian Stab","Iryna Gurevych"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.3115/v1/D14-1006","Conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2014)"],"references":["319394264_Rhetorical_Structure_Theory_A_Theory_of_Text_Organization","270877312_Argument_extraction_for_supporting_public_policy_formulation","264749988_Annotating_Argument_Components_and_Relations_in_Persuasive_Essays","301408871_DKPro_TC_A_Java-based_Framework_for_Supervised_Learning_Experiments_on_Textual_Data","283581397_Applying_kernel_methods_to_argumentation_mining","273191777_From_Argument_Diagrams_to_Argumentation_Mining_in_Texts","267225315_Identifying_justifications_in_written_dialogs_by_classifying_text_as_argumentative","249688577_Darmstadt_Knowledge_Processing_Repository_Based_on_UIMA","247344637_Constructing_representations_of_arguments","243666472_Argument_Schemes_for_Presumptive_Reasoning"]}
