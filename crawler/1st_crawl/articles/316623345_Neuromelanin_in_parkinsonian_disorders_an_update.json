{"id":"316623345_Neuromelanin_in_parkinsonian_disorders_an_update","abstract":"Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark pigment that accumulates linearly with ageing in Substantia Nigra (SN) and Locus Coeruleus (LC). Dual protective and toxic role of NM has been hypothesized according to its intra or extraneuronal deposition. Melanised dopaminergic neurons in SN and LC seem to have special vulnerability to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Paramagnetic properties of NM due to its association to metals like iron induce T1 prolongation; hence measurement of SN-sensitive contrast could be a useful diagnostic biomarker in neurodegenerative disease like PD and other atypical parkinsonisms. This paper will review NM histopathology and neurochemistry studies in health and diseases and the role of imaging targeting NM load in parkinsonian disorders.","authors":["Antonio Martin-Bastida","Sara Pietracupa","Paola Piccini"],"meta":["May 2017The International journal of neuroscience 127(12):01-38","DOI:10.1080/00207454.2017.1325883"],"references":["310429930_Synthesis_structure_characterization_and_evaluation_in_microglia_cultures_of_neuromelanin_analogues_suitable_for_modeling_Parkinson_Disease","306362965_Neuromelanin_Imaging_and_Dopaminergic_Loss_in_Parkinson's_Disease","304030489_Melanin_and_neuromelanin_binding_of_drugs_and_chemicals_toxicological_implications","311902943_Contrast_mechanisms_associated_with_neuromelanin-MRI_Neuromelanin-MRI_Contrast","283444548_Magnetic_resonance_correlation_of_iron_content_with_neuromelanin_in_the_substantia_nigra_of_early-stage_Parkinson's_disease","282816093_Interactions_of_iron_dopamine_and_neuromelanin_pathways_in_brain_aging_and_Parkinson's_disease","276954819_The_substantia_nigra_of_the_human_brain_II_Patterns_of_loss_of_dopamine-containing_neurons_in_Parkinson's_disease","274684489_Human_neuromelanin_an_endogenous_microglial_activator_for_dopaminergic_neuron_death","273470501_Substantia_nigra_neuromelanin-MR_imaging_differentiates_essential_tremor_from_Parkinson's_disease","272676673_Automated_Neuromelanin_Imaging_as_a_Diagnostic_Biomarker_for_Parkinson's_Disease"]}
