{"id":"262213232_Brooks-Type_Theorems_for_Choosability_with_Separation","abstract":"We consider the following type of problems. Given a graph G = (V, E) and lists L(v) of allowed colors for its vertices v ∈ V such that |L(v)| = p for all v ∈ V and |L(u) ∩ L(v)| ≤ c for all uv ∈ E, is it possible to find a “list coloring,” i.e., a color f(v) ∈ L(v) for each v ∈ V, so that f(u) ≠ f(v) for all uv ∈ E? We prove that every of maximum degree Δ admits a list coloring for every such list assignment, provided p ≥ . Apart from a multiplicative constant, the result is tight, as lists of length may be necessary. Moreover, for G = Kn (the complete graph on n vertices) and c = 1 (i.e., almost disjoint lists), the smallest value of p is shown to have asymptotics (1 + o(1)). For planar graphs and c = 1, lists of length 4 suffice. ˜© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Graph Theory 27: 43–49, 1998","authors":["J. Kratochvíl","Zs.
