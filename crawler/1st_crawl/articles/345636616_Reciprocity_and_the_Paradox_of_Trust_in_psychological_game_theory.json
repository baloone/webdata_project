{"id":"345636616_Reciprocity_and_the_Paradox_of_Trust_in_psychological_game_theory","abstract":"Rabin's psychological game-theoretic model of ‘fairness’ has been the starting point for a literature about preferences for reciprocity. In this literature, reciprocity is modelled by defining an individual's ‘kindness’ or ‘unkindness’ in terms of the consequences of his actions for others, and assuming a motivation to reward (punish) other people's kindness (unkindness). Contrary to intuition, this form of reciprocity cannot explain mutually beneficial trust and trustworthiness in a simple Trust Game. We formalise and offer a diagnosis of this ‘Paradox of Trust’. We distinguish between two kinds of reciprocity. Rabin's concept of reciprocal kindness is a psychologically plausible motivation, and the paradox is an informative result about the implications of this motivation. However, trust is better understood in terms of reciprocal cooperation – the motivation to play one's part in mutually beneficial practices, conditional on others playing their parts. We show that a theory of reciprocal cooperation can avoid the paradox.","authors":["Andrea Isoni","Robert Sugden"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 167:219-227","DOI:10.1016/j.jebo.2018.04.015"],"references":["319369070_Team_reasoning_and_a_measure_of_mutual_advantage_in_games","273296354_Team_Reasoning_and_Intentional_Cooperation_for_Mutual_Benefit","266379628_Virtual_bargaining_A_theory_of_social_decision-making","274242784_The_Backward_Induction_Paradox","231882241_Thinking_as_a_Team_Towards_an_Explanation_of_Nonselfish_Behavior","222821680_A_Theory_of_Reciprocity","222656450_A_Theory_of_Sequential_Reciprocity","222550447_Positive_Reciprocity_and_Intentions_in_Trust_Games","222305932_Trust_Reciprocity_and_Social_History","32898134_Modeling_Rational_Players"]}
