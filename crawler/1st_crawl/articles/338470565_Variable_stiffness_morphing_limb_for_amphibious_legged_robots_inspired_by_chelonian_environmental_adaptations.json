{"id":"338470565_Variable_stiffness_morphing_limb_for_amphibious_legged_robots_inspired_by_chelonian_environmental_adaptations","abstract":"Robotic vehicles capable of transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion face considerable challenges associated with propulsive efficiency and performance in each environment. Here we present a morphing amphibious robotic limb that combines the locomotor adaptations of sea turtles for swimming and tortoises for walking. The limb can transform between the streamlined morphology of a sea turtle flipper to the load-bearing geometry of a tortoise leg using a variable stiffness material coupled to a pneumatic actuator system. Herein, we describe the fabrication and characterization of the morphing limb, and quantitatively show how morphing between hydrodynamic and axial-load bearing states can enhance the locomotive performance of a single design over land and in water.","authors":["Robert Baines","Simon Freeman","Frank E Fish","Rebecca Kramer"],"meta":["January 2020Bioinspiration & Biomimetics 15(2)","DOI:10.1088/1748-3190/ab68e8"],"references":["334846547_Reconfigurable_soft_body_trajectories_using_unidirectionally_stretchable_composite_laminae","309392965_On_the_Fence_versus_All_in_Insights_from_Turtles_for_the_Evolution_of_Aquatic_Locomotor_Specializations_and_Habitat_Transitions_in_Tetrapod_Vertebrates","263211818_Effect_of_Cure_Temperature_on_the_Glass_Transition_Temperature_and_Mechanical_Properties_of_Epoxy_Adhesives","260634709_Salamandra_Robotica_II_An_Amphibious_Robot_to_Study_Salamander-Like_Swimming_and_Walking_Gaits","241543096_Transitions_from_Drag-based_to_Lift-based_Propulsion_in_Mammalian_Swimming","236276800_Flipper-driven_terrestrial_locomotion_of_a_sea_turtle-inspired_robot","22157525_Bone_Compressive_Strength_The_Influence_of_Density_and_Strain_Rate","7932799_Giant_Galapagos_tortoises_walk_without_inverted_pendulum_mechanical-energy_exchange","5476441_Mechanics_of_limb_bone_loading_during_terrestrial_locomotion_in_river_cooter_turtles_Pseudemys_concinna","3232055_Structure_and_Mechanics_of_Nonpiscine_Control_Surfaces","344479549_Dynamic_Mechanical_Analysis_A_Practical_Introduction_Second_Edition","322881839_On_a_CPG-based_Hexapod_Robot_AmphiHex-II_with_Variable_Stiffness_Legs","305846293_A_roller-skatingwalking_mode-based_amphibious_robot","271792105_Swimming_and_Diving_in_Young_Loggerhead_Sea_Turtles_Caretta_caretta_L","260283338_Amphibious_Pattern_Design_of_a_Robotic_Fish_with_Wheel-propeller-fin_Mechanisms","249488185_Estimates_of_mechanical_stresses_in_tortoise_leg_muscles","244954041_A_Comparison_of_the_Swimming_of_Marine_and_Freshwater_Turtles","230172683_The_gaits_of_Chelonians_walking_techniques_for_very_low_speeds","229458838_Effect_of_epoxy-amine_stoichiometry_on_cured_resin_material_properties","222561662_AmphiBot_I_An_amphibious_snake-like_robot","22321192_Storage_of_elastic_strain_energy_in_muscle_and_other_tissues","15969136_Experimental_analysis_of_the_gait_and_frequency_of_locomotion_in_the_tortoise_with_a_simple_mathematical_description"]}
