{"id":"338965418_Biomedical_Engineering_An_Exploratory_Analysis_of_the_Field","abstract":"Technological advances have a significant impact in medical sciences. biomedical engineering, which is a multi-faceted field that includes engineering, biology, chemistry, computer science, and several areas of the medical sciences among others, is the topic of this study. With a humble beginning over a century ago and formally created in the early years of the 1960s, biomedical engineering has become a strong, highly competitive and productive field. Its literature has worldwide coverage with an accelerated increase after 2000. In this study, the authors explore two issues: First, what constitute the subject domain of Biomedical Engineering and second with the use of the Web of Science present important bibliographic parameters of the literature.","authors":["Meredith Ayers","Nestor Osorio"],"meta":["January 2020"],"references":["296872898_Challenges_in_providing_unpublished_research_data_in_biomedical_engineering_to_grey_literature_repositories","286045311_Myofibroblasts_and_mechano-regulation_of_connective_tissue_remodelling","236968489_Determining_scientific_impact_using_a_collaboration_index","233849172_Fifty_years_of_publishing_in_biomedical_engineering_Reflections_after_7-year_editorship","312052166_Availability_of_digital_object_identifiers_in_publications_archived_by_PubMed","303606417_Hydrogels_for_Biomedical_Applications","292843283_Biomedical_engineering_A_historical_perspective","255980082_Molecular_Photovoltaics","244906530_Researchers_look_at_undergraduate_biomedical_engineering_education","234817154_A_programming_system_for_the_on-line_analysis_of_biomedical_images","15071498_Biodegradable_Long-Circulating_Polymeric_Nanospheres","224482447_Biomedical_Engineering's_Greatest_Contribution","222804846_Biodegradable_Polymers_as_Biomaterials","7273943_Biodegradable_and_Bioactive_Porous_PolymerInorganic_Composite_Scaffolds_for_Bone_Tissue_Engineering","5312718_Writing_for_publication_in_biomedical_engineering"]}
