{"id":"277976289_Algorithms_for_the_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem","abstract":"A feedback vertex set F of an undirected graph G is a vertex subset of G whose removal results in a forest. Such a set F is said to be independent if F forms an independent set of G. In this paper, we study the problem of finding an independent feedback vertex set of a given graph with the minimum number of vertices, from the viewpoint of graph classes. This problem is NP-hard even for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree four. However, we show that the problem is solvable in linear time for graphs having tree-like structures, more specifically, for bounded treewidth graphs, chordal graphs and cographs. We then give a fixed-parameter algorithm for planar graphs when parameterized by the solution size. Such a fixed-parameter algorithm is already known for general graphs, but our algorithm is exponentially faster than the known one.","authors":["Yuma Tamura","Takehiro Ito","Xiao Zhou"],"meta":["June 2015IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics Communications and Computer Sciences E98.A(6):1179-1188","DOI:10.1587/transfun.E98.A.1179"],"references":["236263982_A_Ock_n_5-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Treewidth","226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","220980102_Two_Birds_with_One_Stone_The_Best_of_Branchwidth_and_Treewidth_with_One_Algorithm","220752622_New_Algorithms_for_k-Face_Cover_k-Feedback_Vertex_Set_and_k-Disjoint_Cycles_on_Plane_and_Planar_Graphs","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","220532922_A_2-Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Undirected_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem","282799935_Approximation_algorithms_for_the_feedback_vertex_set_problem_with_applications_to_constraint_satisfaction_and_bayesian_inference","277473416_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Small_Treewidth","262327703_Deterministic_Single_Exponential_Time_Algorithms_for_Connectivity_Problems_Parameterized_by_Treewidth","253953703_An_Improved_Parameterized_Algorithm_for_the_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem","229765698_On_feedback_vertex_sets_and_nonseparating_independent_sets_in_cubic_graphs","228110121_Graph_Classes_a_Survey","225104327_Algorithmic_Meta-theorems_for_Restrictions_of_Treewidth","222115289_Seymour_PD_Graph_minors_II_Algorithmic_aspects_of_tree-width_J_Algorithms_73_309-322","221427045_On_Parameterized_Independent_Feedback_Vertex_Set","220570220_Linear_Time_Modular_Decomposition_of_Directed_Graphs","200034146_Graph_Rewriting_An_Algebraic_and_Logic_Approach","2898051_Subexponential_Parameterized_Algorithms_on_Graphs_of_Bounded-Genus_and_H-Minor-Free_Graphs","2862741_Dominating_Sets_in_Planar_Graphs_Branch-Width_and_Exponential_Speed-Up"]}
