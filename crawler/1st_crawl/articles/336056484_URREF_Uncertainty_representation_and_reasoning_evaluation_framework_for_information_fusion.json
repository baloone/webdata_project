{"id":"336056484_URREF_Uncertainty_representation_and_reasoning_evaluation_framework_for_information_fusion","abstract":"Uncertainty management is a key aspect of any information fu-sion (IF) system. Evaluation of how uncertainty is dealt with withina given IF system is distinct from, although closely related to, evalu-ation of the overall performance of the system. This paper presentsthe Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Evaluation Frame-work (URREF), which is developed by the ISIF Evaluation of Tech-niques for Uncertainty Representation Working Group (ETURWG)for evaluating the uncertainty management aspects of IF systems.The paper describes the scope of the framework, its core elementâ€“the URREF ontology, the elementary fusion process it considers,and how these are related to the subjects being evaluated using theframework. Although material about the URREF has been previ-ously published elsewhere, this work is the first to provide a com-prehensive overview of the framework, establishing its scope, coreelements, elementary fusion process considered, and relationshipbetween these and the subjects they are designed to evaluate. Wealso briefly describe a few use cases of the framework, discussinghow URREF can be applied in their evaluation.","authors":["Paulo Costa","Anne-Laure Jousselme","Kathryn Blackmond Laskey","Erik Blasch"],"meta":["June 2019","Project: Evaluation Techniques for Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning"],"references":["312151391_An_expert-driven_causal_model_of_the_rhino_poaching_problem","307415327_A_Model-Based_Approach_for_Aviation_Cyber_Security_Risk_Assessment","305279024_Uncertainty_evaluation_of_data_and_information_fusion_within_the_context_of_the_decision_loop","327492569_Application_of_URREF_Criteria_to_Assess_Knowledge_Representation_in_Cyber_Threat_Models","327492568_Information_and_Source_Quality_Ontology_in_Support_to_Maritime_Situational_Awareness","327483934_Towards_the_Rational_Development_and_Evaluation_of_Complex_Fusion_Systems_A_URREF-Driven_Approach","327479300_Experimental_Comparison_of_Ad_Hoc_Methods_for_Classification_of_Maritime_Vessels_Based_on_Real-Life_AIS_Data","327478957_Latent_Variable_Bayesian_Networks_Constructed_Using_Structural_Equation_Modelling","308789965_URREF_Reliability_versus_Credibility_in_Information_Fusion_STANAG_2511","304564688_A_mathematical_theory_of_evidence"]}
