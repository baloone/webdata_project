{"id":"325921255_A_Composite_BRDF_Model_for_Hazy_Gloss","abstract":"We introduce a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model for the rendering of materials that exhibit hazy reflections, whereby the specular reflections appear to be flanked by a surrounding halo. The focus of this work is on artistic control and ease of implementation for real‐time and off‐line rendering. We propose relying on a composite material based on a pair of arbitrary BRDF models; however, instead of controlling their physical parameters, we expose perceptual parameters inspired by visual experiments [VBF17]. Our main contribution then consists in a mapping from perceptual to physical parameters that ensures the resulting composite BRDF is valid in terms of reciprocity, positivity and energy conservation. The immediate benefit of our approach is to provide direct artistic control over both the intensity and extent of the haze effect, which is not only necessary for editing purposes, but also essential to vary haziness spatially over an object surface. Our solution is also simple to implement as it requires no new importance sampling strategy and relies on existing BRDF models. Such a simplicity is key to approximating the method for the editing of hazy gloss in real‐time and for compositing.","authors":["Pascal Barla","Romain Pacanowski","Peter Vangorp"],"meta":["July 2018Computer Graphics Forum 37(4)","DOI:10.1111/cgf.13475"],"references":["317256904_The_perception_of_hazy_gloss","310822819_An_intuitive_control_space_for_material_appearance","230816023_BRDF_Models_for_Accurate_and_Efficient_Rendering_of_Glossy_Surfaces","220720908_Toward_a_Psychophysically-based_Light_Reflection_Model_for_Image_Synthesis","220184024_A_Reflectance_Model_for_Computer_Graphics","47862713_A_Unified_Approach_to_Prefiltered_Environment_Maps","2523875_An_anisotropic_phong_BRDF_model","2376223_Diffraction_Shaders","326273776_Artist_Friendly_Metallic_Fresnel","318758860_Physically_based_shading_in_theory_and_practice","318610292_A_Two-Scale_Microfacet_Reflectance_Model_Combining_Reflection_and_Diffraction","317643900_STD_Student's_t-Distribution_of_Slopes_for_Microfacet_Based_BSDFs","309761988_Geometrical_Considerations_and_Nomenclature_for_Reflectance","280682158_Understanding_the_Masking-Shadowing_Function_in_Microfacet-Based_BRDFs","270136625_A_Comprehensive_Framework_for_Rendering_Layered_Materials","261845886_Accurate_fitting_of_measured_reflectances_using_a_Shifted_Gamma_micro-facet_distribution","252644410_The_Prediction_Of_BRDFs_From_Surface_Profile_Measurements","242397026_Average_irregularity_representation_of_a_rough_surface_for_ray_reflection","234792073_Model_of_Light_Reflection_for_Computer_Synthesized_Pictures","234417243_The_Scattering_of_Electromagnetic_Waves_From_Rough_Surfaces","220979103_Arbitrarily_layered_micro-facet_surfaces","220853053_Experimental_analysis_of_BRDF_models","220720395_Measuring_and_Modeling_Anisotropic_Reflection","215506123_The_Rendering_Equation","30868031_Models_of_Light_Reflection_for_Computer_Synthesized_Pictures","3012551_Geometrical_Shadowing_of_a_Random_Rough_Surface","2414626_A_New_Change_of_Variables_for_Efficient_BRDF_Representation","2269169_An_Inexpensive_BRDF_Model_for_Physically-based_Rendering"]}
