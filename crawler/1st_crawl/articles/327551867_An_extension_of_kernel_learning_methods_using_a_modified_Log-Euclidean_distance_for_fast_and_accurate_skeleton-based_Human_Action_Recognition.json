However, in the case of action recognition, singular\ncovariance matrices cannot be avoided because the dimension of features\ncould be higher than the number of samples. Such covariance matrices (non\nsingular and singular) belong to the space of Symmetric Positive semi-\nDefinite (SPsD) matrices.\nThus, in order to classify actions, we propose to adapt kernel methods\nsuch as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL)\nto the space of SPsD matrices by using a perturbed Log-Euclidean distance\n(Arsigny et al., 2006). The mathematical validity of this perturbed\ndistance (called Modified Log-Euclidean distance) for SPsD is therefore\nstudied. The offline experiments are conducted on three challenging\nbenchmarks, namely MSRAction3D, UTKinect and Multiview3D datasets. A\nfair comparison demonstrates that our approach competes with state-ofthe-\nart methods in terms of accuracy and computational latency. Finally,\nour method is extended to an online scenario and experiments on MSRC12\nprove the efficiency of this extension.","authors":["Enjie Ghorbel","Jacques Boonaert","Rémi Boutteau","Stéphane Lecoeuche"],"meta":["September 2018Computer Vision and Image Understanding","DOI:10.1016/j.cviu.2018.09.004"],"references":["325896767_Kinematic_Spline_Curves_A_temporal_invariant_descriptor_for_fast_action_recognition","295908595_Toward_a_Real_Time_View-invariant_3D_Action_Recognition","292952440_Real-Time_Skeleton-Tracking-Based_Human_Action_Recognition_Using_Kinect_Data","326788254_Online_Human_Action_Recognition_Based_on_Incremental_Learning_of_Weighted_Covariance_Descriptors","310416523_Skeleton_Optical_Spectra_Based_Action_Recognition_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","309315116_Action_Recognition_From_Depth_Maps_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","304574380_From_handcrafted_to_learned_representations_for_human_action_recognition_A_survey","301344649_3D-based_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Action_Recognition_with_Depth_Sequences","291113802_A_metric_for_covariance_matrices","286593893_Super_Normal_Vector_for_Activity_Recognition_Using_Depth_Sequences"]}
