{"id":"316649317_Joint_optimization_of_train_assignment_and_predictive_maintenance_scheduling","abstract":"In this paper, we propose to jointly optimize the rolling stock assignment and the maintenance scheduling in a Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) context. The aim is to determine an appropriate use of the rolling stock considering predefined train timetables and prognostics information. The problem is to associate a rolling stock unit to each train trip and to integrate the necessary maintenance operations in the schedule according to the real state of health of trains. This problem, which falls within the decision part of PHM, is proposed to be solved using an optimal approach based on Linear Programming. The use of the proposed linear program is illustrated on a simple use case.","authors":["Nathalie Herr","Jean-Marc Nicod","Christophe Varnier","Noureddine Zerhouni"],"meta":["April 2017","Conference: RailLille2017 -- 7th International Conference on Railway Operations Modelling and AnalysisAt: Lille, France"],"references":["311232830_An_adaptive_opportunistic_maintenance_model_based_on_railway_track_condition_prediction","282492656_Condition_Based_Maintenance_in_Railway_Transportation_Systems_Based_on_Big_Data_Streaming_Analysis","282284006_Maintenance_Scheduling_in_Rolling_Stock_Circulations_in_Rapid_Transit_Networks","264562705_The_travelling_maintainer_problem_Integration_of_condition-based_maintenance_with_the_travelling_salesman_problem","281050673_Optimisation_Discrete_de_la_modelisation_a_la_resolution_par_des_logiciels_de_programmation_mathematique","275897914_Maintenance_scheduling_of_geographically_distributed_assets_with_prognostics_information","275532753_Short-term_Rail_Rolling_Stock_Rostering_and_Maintenance_Scheduling","257932447_A_dynamic_predictive_maintenance_policy_for_complex_multi-component_systems"]}
