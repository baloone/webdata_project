{"id":"348352188_Using_Opinion_Mining_as_an_educational_analytic_An_integrated_strategy_for_the_analysis_of_students'_feedback","abstract":"The analysis of students' feedback written in natural language has been poorly considered in academic institutions, looking more frequently at students' ratings as a base to evaluate courses and instructors. Statistical text analyses offer the possibility of exploring text collections from a quantitative viewpoint. Particularly interesting is Opinion Mining (OM), a family of techniques at the crossroads of Statistics, Linguistics and Computer Science. OM allows evaluating the sentiment of individual opinions, highlighting their semantic orientation. In an educational context, this approach allows processing students' comments and creating powerful analytics. This paper aims at introducing readers to OM, presenting a strategy to compute the sentiment polarity of students' comments. After explaining the rationale of the proposal and its mathematical formalisation, a toy example is presented to show how it works in practice. A discussion about theoretical and empirical implications offers some hints about its potentiality in a learning environment.","authors":["Michelangelo Misuraca","Germana Scepi","Maria Spano"],"meta":["March 2021Studies In Educational Evaluation 68:100979","DOI:10.1016/j.stueduc.2021.100979","Project: Statistical Methods for Text Mining"],"references":["346040805_Sentiment_analysis_in_education_research_a_review_of_journal_publications","342871060_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Students'_Evaluation_of_Higher_Educational_Institutions","341941946_Unsupervised_Analytic_Strategies_to_Explore_Large_Document_Collections","338350715_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Social_Media_and_Its_Application_Systematic_Literature_Review","334977989_Syntactic_Semantic_and_Sentiment_Analysis_The_Joint_Effect_on_Automated_Essay_Evaluation","347157186_Educational_Culture_and_Job_Market_A_Text_Mining_Approach","343932668_Demonstrating_the_potential_of_text_mining_for_analysing_school_inspection_reports_a_sentiment_analysis_of_17000_Ofsted_documents","343677015_Using_Opinion_Mining_in_Student_Assessments_to_Improve_Teaching_Quality_in_Universities","339604918_Using_standards_to_evaluate_accountability_policy_in_context_School_administrator_and_teacher_perceptions_of_a_teacher_evaluation_system","339502749_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis"]}
