{"id":"299520194_A_research_framework_of_smart_education","abstract":"The development of new technologies enables learners to learn more effectively, efficiently, flexibly and comfortably. Learners utilize smart devices to access digital resources through wireless network and to immerse in both personalized and seamless learning. Smart education, a concept that describes learning in digital age, has gained increased attention. This paper discusses the definition of smart education and presents a conceptual framework. A four-tier framework of smart pedagogies and ten key features of smart learning environments are proposed for foster smart learners who need master knowledge and skills of the 21st century learning. The smart pedagogy framework includes class-based differentiated instruction, group-based collaborative learning, individual-based personalized learning and mass-based generative learning. Furthermore, a technological architecture of smart education, which emphasizes the role of smart computing, is proposed. The tri-tier architecture and key functions are all presented. Finally, challenges of smart education are discussed.","authors":["Zhiting Zhu","Ming-Hua Yu","Peter Riezebos"],"meta":["March 2016Smart Learning Environments 3(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40561-016-0026-2","Project: Construction and applications of smarter education environments"],"references":["286690038_Making_Sense_of_MOOCs_Musings_in_a_Maze_of_Myth_Paradox_and_Possibility","286529907_In_Search_of_Localization_Criteria_for_Learning_Solutions_Examining_the_localization_needs_of_Finnish_learning_solutions_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates","286248373_Definition_framework_and_research_issues_of_smart_learning_environments_-_a_context-aware_ubiquitous_learning_perspective","305196412_Collaborative_Learning_Enhances_Critical_Thinking","299037708_When_and_where_do_we_apply_what_we_learn_A_taxonomy_for_far_transfer","293142981_Differentiated_instruction_Inclusive_strategies_for_standards-based_learning_that_benefit_the_whole_class","289931263_Evolution_to_Smart_Learning_in_Public_Education_A_Case_Study_of_Korean_Public_Education","288494685_Promises_and_Threats_iN2015_Masterplan_to_Pervasive_Computing_in_Singapore","287104845_The_Flipped_Classroom_Online_instruction_at_home_frees_class_time_for_learning","286284765_An_exploratory_study_on_concept_and_realization_conditions_of_smart_learning"]}
