{"id":"279632781_Partitioning_Uncertain_Workflows","abstract":"It is common practice to partition complex workflows into separate channels\nin order to speed up their completion times. When this is done within a\ndistributed environment, unavoidable fluctuations make individual realizations\ndepart from the expected average gains. We present a method for breaking any\ncomplex workflow into several workloads in such a way that once their outputs\nare joined, their full completion takes less time and exhibit smaller variance\nthan when running in only one channel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nmethod in two different scenarios; the optimization of a convex function and\nthe transmission of a large computer file over the Internet.","authors":["Bernardo Huberman","Freddy C.
