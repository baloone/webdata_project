{"id":"330513245_A_Visualization_Technique_to_Support_Searching_Filtering","abstract":"This paper discusses the need for an integrative literature review on Information Visualization for exploratory search particularly in handling data overload. The paper analyses many applications and web sites across disciplines. Certain search engines incorporate visualization to allow for better understanding of the information and at the same time reduce information overload. Current search engines use the query and response (lookup) process. Exploratory search allows for open-ended search. Visual representation is one feature in exploratory search that can be used to improve the overall search. The main contribution of this paper is the review of previous exploratory-search-based works, the utilised features as well as its existing applications, visualizations as the mechanism for developing filters to narrow down the results of searching. Many studies have shown that replacing traditional search engines with exploratory search by using the features of exploratory search can reduce the data overload.","authors":["Mohammed Mahdi","Abdul Rahim Ahmad","Roslan Ismail"],"meta":["January 2019MATEC Web of Conferences 255(MATEC Web Conf):05003","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/20192","Project: Search Engine"],"references":["325815375_Paradigm_Extension_of_Faceted_Search_Techniques_A_Review","283959959_Is_exploratory_search_different_A_comparison_of_information_search_behavior_for_exploratory_and_lookup_tasks","323498736_Information_Visualization_for_Interactive_Information_Retrieval","313120705_Investigating_queries_and_search_failures_in_academic_search","311169843_Preference-Enriched_Faceted_Search_for_Voting_Aid_Applications","308161218_Introduction_to_information_retrieval_chapt","304898664_Envisioning_Information","303595577_Searching_web_documents_using_a_summarization_approach","300490829_Modeling_Faceted_Browsing_with_Category_Theory_to_Support_Interoperability_and_Reuse","290196314_Context-Aware_Semantic_Classification_of_Search_Queries_for_Browsing_Community_Question-Answering_Archives"]}
