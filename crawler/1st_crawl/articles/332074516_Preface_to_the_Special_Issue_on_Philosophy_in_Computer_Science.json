{"id":"332074516_Preface_to_the_Special_Issue_on_Philosophy_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"Fleck’s concept of thought style allows to realize the fact that in contemporary empirical sciences we deal with a computer thought style, as most research works are currently conducted with the use of computer-aided systems. In this article I support the thesis that contemporary research works are dominated by the computer research style.
