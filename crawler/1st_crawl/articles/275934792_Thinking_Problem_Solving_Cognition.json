{"id":"275934792_Thinking_Problem_Solving_Cognition","abstract":"Reflecting important new research developments of the past eight years as well as classic theories of problem solving, this book provides a balanced survey of the higher cognitive processes, human thinking, problem solving, and learning. Divided into four parts, the book discusses associationism and Gestalt theory before introducing current research and theories of induction and deduction in part two. Part three considers recent cognitive theories and discusses information-processing analysis, outlining techniques for analyzing cognition into processes, strategies, and knowledge structures. Finally, the implications and applications of findings in cognitive psychology are examined, with emphasis on applications such as teaching creative problem solving and intelligence measurement. The Second Edition updates research and includes new chapters on everyday thinking, expert problem solving, and analogical reasoning to reflect the growing interest in problem solving within specific domains and in real situations. New and classic problem solving exercises are used liberally throughout the text to illustrate concepts and to enhance the reader's active involvement in the process of problem solving.","authors":["Richard E.
