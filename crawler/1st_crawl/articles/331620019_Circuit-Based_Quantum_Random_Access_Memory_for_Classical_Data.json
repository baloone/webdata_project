{"id":"331620019_Circuit-Based_Quantum_Random_Access_Memory_for_Classical_Data","abstract":"A prerequisite for many quantum information processing tasks to truly surpass classical approaches is an efficient procedure to encode classical data in quantum superposition states. In this work, we present a circuit-based flip-flop quantum random access memory to construct a quantum database of classical information in a systematic and flexible way. For registering or updating classical data consisting of M entries, each represented by n bits, the method requires O(n) qubits and O(Mn) steps. With post-selection at an additional cost, our method can also store continuous data as probability amplitudes. As an example, we present a procedure to convert classical training data for a quantum supervised learning algorithm to a quantum state. Further improvements can be achieved by reducing the number of state preparation queries with the introduction of quantum forking.","authors":["Daniel Kyungdeock Park","Francesco Petruccione","J.-K.
