{"id":"262326838_Faster_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Deletion_to_Split_Graphs","abstract":"An undirected graph is said to be split if its vertex set can be partitioned into two sets such that the subgraph induced on one of them is a complete graph and the subgraph induced on the other is an independent set. We initiate a systematic study of parameterized complexity of the problem of deleting the minimum number of vertices or edges from a given input graph so that the resulting graph is split. We give efficient fixed-parameter algorithms and polynomial sized kernels for the problem. More precisely, 1.\nfor Split Vertex Deletion, the problem of determining whether there are k vertices whose deletion results in a split graph, we give an \\({\\mathcal{O}}^{*}(2^{k})\\) algorithm (\\({\\mathcal{O}}^{*}()\\) notation hides factors that are polynomial in the input size) improving on the previous best bound of \\({\\mathcal{O}}^{*} (2.32^{k})\\). We also give an \\({\\mathcal{O}}(k^{3})\\)-sized kernel for the problem.","authors":["Esha Ghosh","Sudeshna Kolay","Mrinal Kumar","Pranabendu Misra"],"meta":["July 2012Algorithmica 71(4):107-118","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31155-0_10","Conference: Proceedings of the 13th Scandinavian conference on Algorithm Theory"],"references":["225524976_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Vertex_Deletion_into_Perfect_Graph_Classes","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","256720832_Split_Vertex_Deletion_meets_Vertex_Cover_New_fixed-parameter_and_exact_exponential-time_algorithms","233763823_Interval_Deletion_Is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","226034006_Yet_another_method_of_enumerating_unmarked_combinatorial_objects","225470704_Chordal_Deletion_Is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","223229984_On_the_existence_of_subexponential_parameterized_algorithms","222669914_Complexity_Classification_of_Some_Edge_Modification_Problems"]}
