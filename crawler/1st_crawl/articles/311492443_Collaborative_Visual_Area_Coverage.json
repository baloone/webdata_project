{"id":"311492443_Collaborative_Visual_Area_Coverage","abstract":"This article examines the problem of visual area coverage by a network of Mobile Aerial Agents (MAAs). Each MAA is assumed to be equipped with a downwards facing camera with a conical field of view which covers all points within a circle on the ground. The diameter of that circle is proportional to the altitude of the MAA, whereas the quality of the covered area decreases with the altitude. A distributed control law that maximizes a joint coverage-quality criterion by adjusting the MAAs' spatial coordinates is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is evaluated through simulation studies.","authors":["Sotiris Papatheodorou","Anthony Tzes","Yiannis Stergiopoulos"],"meta":["December 2016Robotics and Autonomous Systems 92","DOI:10.1016/j.robot.2017.03.005"],"references":["352787125_Network_Connectivity_and_Area_Coverage_for_UAV_Fleet_Mobility_Model_with_Energy_Constraint","303797259_Multi-objective_multi-robot_deployment_in_a_dynamic_environment","298429684_Distributed_partitioning_algorithms_for_multi-agent_networks_with_quadratic_proximity_metrics_and_sensing_constraints","293194635_Coverage_Path_Planning_for_UAVs_Photogrammetry_with_Energy_and_Resolution_Constraints","283475871_Multi-UAV_Routing_for_Area_Coverage_and_Remote_Sensing_with_Minimum_Time","281808629_Voronoi-Based_Coverage_Control_of_Heterogeneous_Disk-Shaped_Robots","272829599_Cooperative_PositioningOrientation_Control_of_Mobile_Heterogeneous_Anisotropic_Sensor_Networks_for_Area_Coverage","271649293_Distributed_coverage_control_for_concave_areas_by_a_heterogeneous_Robot-Swarm_with_visibility_sensing_constraints","261274853_Vision-based_multi-agent_cooperative_target_search","224992831_Eyes_in_the_Sky_Decentralized_Control_for_the_Deployment_of_Robotic_Camera_Networks","224208403_Convex_Voronoi-inspired_space_partitioning_for_heterogeneous_networks_A_coverage-oriented_approach","221070706_Optimal_Coverage_for_Multiple_Hovering_Robots_with_Downward-Facing_Cameras","221042423_Sensing_and_coverage_for_a_network_of_heterogeneous_robots","345834991_Discretized_optimal_control_approach_for_dynamic_multi-agent_decentralized_coverage","324460429_Differentiation_Under_the_Integral_Sign","306115689_Voronoi_based_decentralized_coverage_problem_From_optimal_control_to_Model_Predictive_Control","305869777_A_sensor_coverage_game_with_improved_efficiency_guarantees","305773361_Introduction","303771118_Distributed_Dynamic_Coverage_and_Avoidance_Control_Under_Anisotropic_Sensing","296691159_Coverage_path_planning_with_unmanned_aerial_vehicles_for_3D_terrain_reconstruction","283852548_Distributed_Receding_Horizon_Coverage_Control_for_Multiple_Mobile_Robots","272829669_Distributed_Collaborative_Coverage-Control_Schemes_for_Non-Convex_Domains","269268178_Distributed_visibility-based_coverage_using_a_swarm_of_UAVs_in_known_3D-terrains","265666381_Differentiation_Under_the_Integral_Sign","261200289_Connectivity_versus_area_coverage_in_unmanned_aerial_vehicle_networks","256660857_Spatially_distributed_area_coverage_optimisation_in_mobile_robotic_networks_with_arbitrary_convex_anisotropic_patterns","254098821_Multi-robot_three-dimensional_coverage_of_unknown_areas","251630426_Switching_model_predictive_attitude_control_for_a_quadrotor_helicopter_subject_to_atmospheric_disturbances","224201012_Distributed_Coverage_Control_on_Surfaces_in_3D_Space","41714320_Spatially-distributed_coverage_optimization_and_control_with_limited-range_interactions","3299441_Coverage_Control_for_Mobile_Sensing_Networks"]}
