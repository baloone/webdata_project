{"id":"318234630_The_Impact_of_Kinematic_Redundancies_on_the_Conditioning_of_a_Planar_Parallel_Manipulator","abstract":"Parallel manipulators present drawbacks such as singularities inside their workspace. In order to measure these drawbacks, the condition number of the Jacobian matrix can be used either as a measurement of the distance between the end effector and singularities or as an isotropy index. In this paper, a study of the impact of kinematic redundancies on the improvement of a planar manipulator’s isotropicity and on the reduction of singularities is presented. In order to do so, conditioning maps are exploited for the non-redundant 3RRR and for the kinematically redundant 3PRRR manipulators. The outcome of this evaluation supports evidences in favor of kinematic redundancies regarding kinematic characteristics.","authors":["João Vitor de Carvalho Fontes","Hiparco Lins Vieira","Maíra Martins Silva"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-60867-9_51","In book: Computational Kinematics (pp.449-456)","Project: Analysis and control of kinematically redundant planar manipulators"],"references":["288981833_Numerical_Analysis_and_Prototyping_Details_of_a_Planar_Parallel_Redundant_Manipulator","267622346_Consistent_Kinetostatic_Indices_for_Planar_3-DOF_Parallel_Manipulators_Application_to_the_Optimal_Kinematic_Inversion","260210917_Manipulator_Performance_Measures_-_A_Comprehensive_Literature_Survey","220122633_A_Review_on_the_Dynamic_Control_of_Parallel_Kinematic_Machines_Theory_and_Experiments","3298042_Singularity_Analysis_of_Closed-Loop_Kinematic_Chains","303543329_On_the_dynamic_performance_of_parallel_kinematic_manipulators_with_actuation_and_kinematic_redundancies","256934771_Dynamics_identification_of_kinematically_redundant_parallel_robots_using_the_direct_search_method","220396542_Design_and_analysis_of_kinematically_redundant_parallel_manipulators_with_configurable_platforms"]}
