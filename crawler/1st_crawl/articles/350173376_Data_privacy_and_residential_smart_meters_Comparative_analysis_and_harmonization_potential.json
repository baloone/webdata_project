{"id":"350173376_Data_privacy_and_residential_smart_meters_Comparative_analysis_and_harmonization_potential","abstract":"Building on privacy principles of the Fair Information Practice Principles and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, the study compares national policies and programs in Europe and North America and identifies prevailing practices for implementing privacy goals for residential energy customers: customer opt-out policies, sampling and sharing guidelines, independent data storage, and governmental enforcement authority. The analysis provides the basis for privacy standards that could apply to advanced-metering customer data across countries, even with rapidly evolving technology.","authors":["Dasom Lee","David J.
