{"id":"328672479_Guest_Editorial_Special_Issue_on_Increasing_the_Socio-Cultural_Diversity_of_Electrical_and_Computer_Engineering_and_Related_Fields","abstract":"Universities and colleges struggle to achieve their diversity goals in disciplines including electrical engineering, computer science, and computer engineering. Even if entering students are sufficiently diverse, programs are challenged to provide appropriate support and develop engagement opportunities that enable these students to succeed. Some students from minority populations may have had schooling less well funded than that of their mainstream peers, and while capable of succeeding, may be differently equipped than their peers. This special issue asks: How can efforts to increase success of minority students be designed and implemented? How can programs help faculty to understand challenges diverse students face? How can they change their teaching methods?","authors":["Shannon Chance","Laura Bottomley","Karen Panetta","Bill Williams"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE Transactions on Education 61(4):261-264","DOI:10.1109/TE.2018.2871656"],"references":["297656149_Not_so_global_A_bibliometric_look_at_engineering_education_research","261546899_The_Emergence_of_Engineering_Education_Research_as_an_Internationally_Connected_Field_of_Inquiry"]}
