{"id":"258083744_Game_Theory_with_Translucent_Players","abstract":"A traditional assumption in game theory is that players are opaque to one\nanother -- if a player changes strategies, then this change in strategies does\nnot affect the choice of other players' strategies. In many situations this is\nan unrealistic assumption. We develop a framework for reasoning about games\nwhere the players may be translucent to one another; in particular, a player\nmay believe that if she were to change strategies, then the other player would\nalso change strategies. Translucent players may achieve significantly more\nefficient outcomes than opaque ones.\nOur main result is a characterization of strategies consistent with\nappropriate analogues of common belief of rationality. Common Counterfactual\nBelief of Rationality (CCBR) holds if (1) everyone is rational, (2) everyone\ncounterfactually believes that everyone else is rational (i.e., all players i\nbelieve that everyone else would still be rational even if i were to switch\nstrategies), (3) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is\nrational, and counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and so\non. CCBR characterizes the set of strategies surviving iterated removal of\nminimax dominated strategies: a strategy $\\sigma_i$ is minimax dominated for i\nif there exists a strategy $\\sigma'_i$ for i such that $\\min_{\\mu'_{-i}}\nu_i(\\sigma_i, \\mu_{-i}') > \\max_{\\mu_{-i}} u_i(\\sigma_i, \\mu_{-i})$.","authors":["Joseph Y.
