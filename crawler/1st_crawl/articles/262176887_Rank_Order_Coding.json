{"id":"262176887_Rank_Order_Coding","abstract":"The idea that neurones transmit information using a rate code is extremely entrenched in the neuroscience community. The vast majority of neurophysiological studies simply describe neural responses in terms of firing rate, and while studies using Peri-Stimulus Time Histograms (PSTHs) are fairly common, only rarely does one get to see the underlying spikes in the form of a raster display. Even rarer are studies that provide information about how spikes are generated across a population of neurones.","authors":["Simon Jonathan Thorpe","Jacques Gautrais"],"meta":["December 1998","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4615-4831-7_19","Conference: Computational neuroscience: Trends in researchVolume: In:J.
