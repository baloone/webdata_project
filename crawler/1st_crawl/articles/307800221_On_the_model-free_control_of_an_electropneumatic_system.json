{"id":"307800221_On_the_model-free_control_of_an_electropneumatic_system","abstract":"In this paper, we present a unsed idea to control an electropneumatic system based on the Model-free control. First, we described the mathematical model of the electropneumatic system which presents a complexity and several nonlinearities. Then, the model-free control is presented, which yield a controller based on signal derivation. It is characterized by its simplicity and implementation capability. Finally, we illustrated the effectiveness of this approach on an experimental test bench to highlight the benefits of the newly developed designs over the conventional control structure. The simulation results indicate that our proposed control scheme has good performance with appropriate safety for the electropneumatic system.","authors":["Mariem Harchay","Badreddine Louhichi","Sonia Maalej","Mohamed Smaoui"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1109/STA.2015.7505119","Conference: 2015 16th International Conference on Sciences and Techniques of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering (STA)"],"references":["260535100_Bilateral_Control_of_Nonlinear_Pneumatic_Teleoperation_System_With_Solenoid_Valves","29637417_Etude_preliminaire_d'une_commande_sans_modele_pour_papillon_de_moteur_A_model-free_control_for_an_engine_throttle_a_preliminary_study","3332813_Systematic_control_of_an_electropneumatic_system_Integrator_backstepping_and_sliding_mode_control","261498514_Derivative_based_control_for_LTV_system_with_unknown_parameters","232912827_Sliding_Controller_Design_for_Nonlinear_Systems","224607703_Effects_of_backlash_and_of_speed_dependent_friction_on_the_stability_of_closed-cycle_control_systems","224220614_Robust_Sliding_Mode_Observer_with_Parameters_Estimation_for_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Time-Delay_Systems","222655726_Kinematics_control_of_a_pneumatic_system_by_hybrid_fuzzy_PID"]}
