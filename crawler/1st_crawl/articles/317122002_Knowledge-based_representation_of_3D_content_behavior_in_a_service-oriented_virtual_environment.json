{"id":"317122002_Knowledge-based_representation_of_3D_content_behavior_in_a_service-oriented_virtual_environment","abstract":"Semantic representation of interactive 3D content gains increasing attention due to possibilities of high-level domain-specific content description, inference of hidden knowledge as well as exploration of content on request with the use of semantic queries. However, the available approaches mostly address representation of static 3D objects and scenes, which do not evolve over time, thus disregarding the current state of dynamically changing content. The paper presents knowledge-based representation of 3D content behavior. The representation covers 3D content features at different points in time, enabling reasoning and exploration of dynamic content. The possibility of using different vocabularies enables application of the approach to different domains. The representation can extend the available static semantic 3D content representations, and it can be used together with 3D modeling tools and game engines. The proposed representation has been implemented in the Prolog declarative language and deployed within a service-oriented virtual environment with the Unity game engine.","authors":["Jakub Floty≈Ñski","Krzysztof Walczak"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3055624.3075959","Conference: the 22nd International Conference"],"references":["313947976_Ontology-Based_Representation_and_Modelling_of_Synthetic_3D_Content_A_State-of-the-Art_Review_Ontology-Based_Representation_and_Modelling_of_Synthetic_3D_Content","310760591_Temporal_representation_and_reasoning_in_OWL_2","289328820_Multi-platform_Semantic_Representation_of_Interactive_3D_Content","286427583_On-Demand_Generation_of_3D_Content_Based_on_Semantic_Meta-Scenes","284678401_Conceptual_modeling_of_object_behavior_in_a_virtual_environment","282735783_CARL_A_Language_for_Modelling_Contextual_Augmented_Reality_Environments","282735562_Building_Contextual_Augmented_Reality_Environments_with_semantics","282160275_My_Corporis_Fabrica_Embryo_An_ontology-based_3D_spatio-temporal_modeling_of_human_embryo_development","281489532_Conceptual_knowledge-based_modeling_of_interactive_3D_content","277675786_Semantic_Representation_of_Multi-platform_3D_Content","275541400_Semantic_Modelling_of_Interactive_3D_Content_with_Domain-specific_Ontologies","260981484_Enhanced_Decoupling_of_Components_in_Intelligent_Realtime_Interactive_Systems_using_Ontologies","247927391_A_development_environment_using_behavior_patterns_to_facilitate_building_3DVR_applications","234828916_The_role_of_semantics_in_games_and_simulations","232625844_Coupling_Ontologies_with_Graphics_Content_for_Knowledge_Driven_Visualization","226322247_A_logic-based_calculus_of_events","221608066_Making_sense_of_virtual_environments_Action_representation_grounding_and_common_sense","221470222_3D_Challenges_and_a_Non-In-Depth_Overview_of_Recent_Progress","221314664_Semantic_modelling_for_virtual_worlds_a_novel_paradigm_for_realtime_interactive_systems","221314654_A_semantic_environment_model_for_crowd_simulation_in_multilayered_complex_environment","221269532_Conceptual_Modeling_for_Virtual_Reality","221135726_The_Situation_Calculus_and_Event_Calculus_Compared","220831215_An_Ontology-Driven_Approach_for_Modeling_Behavior_in_Virtual_Environments","37446111_An_ontology_of_virtual_humans_IIncorporating_semantics_into_human_shapes","2623069_The_Event_Calculus_Explained","319394983_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","317121965_Semantic_model_for_distributed_augmented_reality_services","305696735_Customization_of_3D_Content_with_Semantic_Meta-Scenes","300789375_Ontology-Based_Creation_of_3D_Content_in_a_Service-Oriented_Environment","300490330_Semantic_query-based_generation_of_customized_3D_scenes","291183979_A_Logic-Based_Calculus_of_Events","285238886_Semantic_contextual_augmented_reality_environments","284817581_Conceptual_Semantic_Representation_of_3D_Content","268192388_Batch_modeling_of_3D_city_based_on_ESRI_cityengine","262329451_Semantic_3D_Media_and_Content_Semantics_and_3D_media_Current_issues_and_perspectives","262234556_Attribit_Content_Creation_with_Semantic_Attributes","261155898_Semantic_multi-layered_design_of_interactive_3D_presentations","224396645_3D_Media_and_the_Semantic_Web","221011083_Semantic_description_of_3D_environments_A_proposal_based_on_web_standards"]}
