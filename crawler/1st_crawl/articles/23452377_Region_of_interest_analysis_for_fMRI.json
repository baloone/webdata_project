{"id":"23452377_Region_of_interest_analysis_for_fMRI","abstract":"A common approach to the analysis of fMRI data involves the extraction of signal from specified regions of interest (or ROI's). Three approaches to ROI analysis are described, and the strengths and assumptions of each method are outlined.","authors":["Russell A Poldrack"],"meta":["April 2007Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience 2(1):67-70","DOI:10.1093/scan/nsm006","SourcePubMed"],"references":["21754359_A_Three-Dimensional_Statistical_Analysis_for_CBF_Activation_Studies_in_Human_Brain","15475846_Functional_Analysis_of_Human_MT_and_Related_Visual_Cortical_Areas_Using_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","296967081_Stability_repeatability_and_the_expression_of_signal_magnitude_in_functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging","289992710_Optimal_experimental_design_for_event-related_fMRI","286271861_A_unified_statistical_approach_for_determining_significant_voxels_in_images_of_cerebral_activation","277530344_Automatically_Parcellating_the_Human_Cerebral_Cortex","238197491_Automated_anatomical_labeling_of_activations_in_SPM_using_a_macroscopic_anatomical_parcellation_of_t","215606905_Co-Planar_Stereotaxic_Atlas_of_The_Human_Brain","43228058_Worsley_KJ_Marrett_S_Neelin_P_Vandal_AC_Friston_KJ_Evans_ACA_unified_statistical_approach_for_determining_significant_signals_in_images_of_cerebral_activation_Hum_Brain_Map_4_58-73","15168650_FMRI_of_human_visual_cortex_5"]}
