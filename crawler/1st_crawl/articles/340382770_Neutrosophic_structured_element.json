{"id":"340382770_Neutrosophic_structured_element","abstract":"This paper presents a new concept in neutrosophic sets (NS) called neutrosophic structured element (NSE). Based on this concept, we define the operational laws, score function, and some aggregation operators of NS. Finally, as an application of this concept, we propose a decision‐making method for a multi‐attribute decision making (MADM) problem under NSE information. The results indicate that this concept is a useful tool for dealing with neutrosophic decision problems.","authors":["SA Edalatpanah"],"meta":["October 2020Expert Systems 37(2):e12542","DOI:10.1111/exsy.12542","Project: uncertainty and indeterminacy in decision-making and optimization"],"references":["339128015_Data_Envelopment_Analysis_for_Simplified_Neutrosophic_Sets","337151353_Data_Envelopment_Analysis_for_Simplified_Neutrosophic_Sets","331816024_A_Multi_Objective_Programming_Approach_to_Solve_Integer_Valued_Neutrosophic_Shortest_Path_Problems","330779076_Neutrosophic_Shortest_Path_Problem","330291834_A_Group_Decision_Making_Framework_Based_on_Neutrosophic_TOPSIS_Approach_for_Smart_Medical_Device_Selection","337445307_A_Study_of_Neutrosophic_Shortest_Path_Problem","330045712_Brain_tumor_segmentation_using_neutrosophic_expert_maximum_fuzzy-sure_entropy_and_other_approaches","329560014_Neutrosophic_Rule-based_Prediction_System_for_Toxicity_Effects_Assessment_of_Biotransformed_Hepatic_Drugs","329460734_A_novel_computer_vision_based_neutrosophic_approach_for_leaf_disease_identification_and_classification","328863351_Neutrosophic_Image_Segmentation_with_Dice_Coefficients","328019101_Neutrosophic_triplet_group","328019084_Neutrosophic_soft_set_decision_making_for_stock_trending_analysis","326883501_Different_Forms_of_Triangular_Neutrosophic_Numbers_De-Neutrosophication_Techniques_and_their_Applications","326431623_Fuzzy_Bi-matrix_games_based_on_fuzzy_structured_element","326415546_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_interval_valued_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets"]}
