{"id":"343863215_m-Polar_Neutrosophic_Topology_with_Applications_to_Multi-_criteria_Decision-Making_in_Medical_Diagnosis_and_Clustering_Analysis","abstract":"In this paper, we first introduce novel concepts of m-polar neutrosophic set (MPNS) and topological structure on m-polar neutrosophic set by combining the m-polar fuzzy set (MPFS) and neutrosophic set. Then, we investigate several characterizations of m-polar neutro-sophic set and establish its various operations with the help of examples. We propose score functions for the comparison of m-polar neutrosophic numbers (MPNNs). We establish m-polar neutrosophic topology and define interior , closure, exterior, and frontier for m-polar neutrosophic sets (MPNSs) with illustrative examples. We discuss some results with counter examples, which hold for classical set theory, but do not hold for m-polar neutrosophic set theory. We introduce a cosine similarity measure and a set theo-retic similarity measure for m-polar neutrosophic sets (MPNSs). Furthermore, we present three algorithms for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) in medical diagnosis and clustering analysis under uncertainty by using m-polar neutrosophic sets (MPNSs) and m-polar neutrosophic topology. Lastly, we present advantages, validity, flexibility , and comparison of our proposed algorithms with the existing techniques.","authors":["Masooma Raza Hashmi","Muhammad Riaz","Florentin Smarandache"],"meta":["August 2020International Journal of Fuzzy Systems 22(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40815-019-00763-2","Project: m-Polar Neutrosophic Set Topology"],"references":["335898427_Linear_Diophantine_fuzzy_set_and_its_applications_towards_multi-attribute_decision-making_problems","335729518_MAGDM_for_agribusiness_in_the_environment_of_various_cubic_m-polar_fuzzy_averaging_aggregation_operators","333558939_Bipolar_Neutrosophic_Sets_and_Their_Application_Based_on_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_Problems","332445812_Cubic_bipolar_fuzzy_ordered_weighted_geometric_aggregation_operators_and_their_application_using_internal_and_external_cubic_bipolar_fuzzy_data","344487298_Hesitant_intuitionistic_fuzzy_linguistic_aggregation_operators_and_their_applications_to_multiple_attribute_decision_making","333794018_N-soft_topology_and_its_applications_to_multi-criteria_group_decision_making","331100296_Novel_Approach_in_Decision_Making_with_m-Polar_Fuzzy_ELECTRE-I","326848879_Another_View_on_Generalized_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Related_Multiattribute_Decision_Making_Methods","326415546_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_interval_valued_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","323410184_Some_similarity_measures_for_picture_fuzzy_sets_and_their_applications"]}
