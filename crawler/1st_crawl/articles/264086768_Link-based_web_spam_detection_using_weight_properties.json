{"id":"264086768_Link-based_web_spam_detection_using_weight_properties","abstract":"Link spam is created with the intention of boosting one target’s rank in exchange of business profit. This unethical way of deceiving Web search engines is known as Web spam. Since then many anti-link spam detection techniques have constantly being proposed. Web spam detection is a crucial task due to its devastation towards Web search engines and global cost of billion dollars annually. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique by incorporating weight properties to enhance the Web spam detection algorithms. Weight properties can be defined as the influences of one Web node towards another Web node. We modified existing Web spam detection algorithms with our novel technique to evaluate the performances on a large public Web spam dataset – WEBSPAM-UK2007. The overall performance have shown that the modified algorithms outperform the benchmark algorithms up to 30.5 % improvement at host level and 6.11 % improvement at page level.","authors":["Kwang Leng Goh","Ravi Kumar","Ashutosh Kumar Singh"],"meta":["August 2014Journal of Intelligent Information Systems 43(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10844-014-0310-y"],"references":["262354549_Link_analysis_ranking_algorithms_theory_and_experiments_ACM_Trans_Internet_Technol_51_231-297","256090172_Link_Based_Spam_Algorithms_in_Adversarial_Information_Retrieval","256089901_Incorporating_Weight_Properties_in_Detection_of_Web_Spam","221614401_Exploiting_bidirectional_links_making_spamming_detection_easier","303137682_Cloaking_and_Redirection_A_Preliminary_Study","277481519_DirichletRank","262407049_Combating_Web_Spam_with_TrustRank","249972408_R-SpamRank_A_Spam_Detection_Algorithm_Based_on_Link_Analysis","248508371_Identifying_link_farm_pages","237912898_Authoritative_sources_in_a_hyperlinked_environment"]}
