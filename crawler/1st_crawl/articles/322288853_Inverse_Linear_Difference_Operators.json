{"id":"322288853_Inverse_Linear_Difference_Operators","abstract":"For matrices whose elements are scalar linear difference operators, algorithms for checking invertibility (unimodularity) and constructing an inverse matrix (if it exists) are proposed. Their complexity is lower than that of other available algorithms. The differences of these algorithms from their differential analogues are discussed.","authors":["Sergei A.
