{"id":"304263470_Probability_1_Computation_with_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","abstract":"The computational power of stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs) varies significantly with the output convention and whether or not error is permitted. Focusing on probability 1 computation, we demonstrate a striking difference between stable computation that converges to a state where the output cannot change, and the notion of limit-stable computation where the output eventually stops changing with probability 1. While stable computation is known to be restricted to semilinear predicates (essentially piecewise linear), we show that limitstable computation encompasses the set of predicates in Î”^0_2 in the arithmetical hierarchy (a superset of Turing-computable). In finite time, our construction achieves an error-correction scheme for Turing universal computation. This work refines our understanding of the tradeoffs between error and computational power in CRNs.","authors":["Rachel Cummings","David Doty","David Soloveichik"],"meta":["January 2014","Conference: DNA computing and molecular programming: 20th International Conference, DNA 20"],"references":[]}
