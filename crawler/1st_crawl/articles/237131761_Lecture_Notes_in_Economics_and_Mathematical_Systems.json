{"id":"237131761_Lecture_Notes_in_Economics_and_Mathematical_Systems","abstract":"In the field of vector (or multi objective) optimization there has been a relatively little interest in solving combinatorial or discrete problems. During the 70’s just a few papers have been published on multi objective (m.o.) integer linear programming. However no special emphasis was put on the important aspect of computational complexity. This can be certainly ascribed to the fact that the theory of NP—completeness was developing at a fast pace in those same years.","authors":["Paolo Serafini"],"meta":["January 1987","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-46618-2_15"],"references":["234807778_On_Finding_the_Maxima_of_a_Set_of_Vectors","225929898_Multicriteria_integer_programming_A_hybrid_dynamic_programming_recursive_approach","220695898_Combinatorial_Optimization_Algorithms_and_Complexity","321546836_Mathematics_of_Multi_Objective_Optimization","312846132_A_Unified_Approach_for_Scalar_and_Vector_Optimization","303444218_Multiple_criteria_decision_making","268536515_Survey_of_algorithms_for_vector_optimisation_problems","266545667_Dual_Relaxation_and_Branch-and-Bound_Techniques_for_Multiobjective_Optimization","265453391_The_traveling_salesman_problem_Bibliography","262351132_Review_of_recent_development_The_matroidal_knapsack_A_class_of_often_well-solvable_problems","244964683_A_note_on_bicriterion_programming","235164548_Integral_Extreme_Points","227237627_Theory_and_Algorithms_for_Linear_Multiple_Objective_Programs_with_Zero-One_Variables","223669168_Multiobjective_mathematical_programming_via_the_Multiplex_model_and_algorithm","223581981_A_Class_of_Practical_Interactive_Branch_and_Bound_Algorithms_for_Multicriteria_Integer_Programming","222762056_The_Shortest_Path_Problem_with_Two_Objectives","222239183_On_a_multicriteria_shortest_path_problem","222165322_On_a_special_class_of_bicriterion_path_problems","201976939_The_traveling_salesman_problem_A_guided_tour_of_combinatorial_optimization_Reprint","4940493_An_Algorithm_for_the_Bi-Criterion_integer_Programming_Problem"]}
