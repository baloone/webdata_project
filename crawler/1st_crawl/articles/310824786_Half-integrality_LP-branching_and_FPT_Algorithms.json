{"id":"310824786_Half-integrality_LP-branching_and_FPT_Algorithms","abstract":"A recent trend in parameterized algorithms is the application of polytope tools to fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms [e.g., Cygan et al., FOCS 2011, 52nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, 2011, pp. 150--159; Narayanaswamy et al., STACS 2012, Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, 2012, pp. 338--349]. Although this approach has yielded significant speedups for a range of important problems, it requires the underlying polytope to have very restrictive properties, including half-integrality and Nemhauser--Trotter-style persistence properties. To date, these properties are essentially known to hold only for two classes of polytopes, covering the cases of Vertex Cover [Nemhauser and Trotter, Math. Program., 8 (1975), pp. 232--248] and Node Multiway Cut [Garg et al., J. Alg., 50 (2004), pp. 49--61]. Taking a slightly different approach, we view half-integrality as a discrete relaxation of a problem, e.g., a relaxation of the search space from $\\{0,1\\}^V$ to $\\{0,...","authors":["Yoichi Iwata","Magnus Wahlstr√∂m","Yuichi Yoshida"],"meta":["January 2016SIAM Journal on Computing 45(4):1377-1411","DOI:10.1137/140962838"],"references":["225749303_An_algorithm_for_packing_non-zero_A-paths_in_group-labelled_graphs","2822026_A_Factor_2_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Generalized_Steiner_Network_Problem","313747340_On_Group_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Parameterized_by_the_Size_of_the_Cutset","249387734_Packing_NonZero_A-Paths_In_Group-Labelled_Graphs","226900103_Vertex_Packings_Structural_Properties_and_Algorithms","220442107_Packing_Non-Returning","220223596_Primal-Dual_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Integral_Flow_and_Multicut_in_Trees"]}
