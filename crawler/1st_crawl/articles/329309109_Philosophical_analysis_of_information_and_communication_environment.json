{"id":"329309109_Philosophical_analysis_of_information_and_communication_environment","abstract":"The purpose of the article is to make a survey taking into account social and philosophical points of view on the young people’s value orientations and identify the specific impact of the information and communication environment on it under the conditions of the information dominant. A transdisciplinary scientific paradigm with its potential to go beyond disciplinary constraints has been used as a methodological basis in studying the change of the young people’s value orientations caused by the influence of the information and communication environment on them under the current conditions. The survey carried out made it possible to distinguish and shed a clearer light on the aspects of the constructive and destructive influence of the information and communication environment on the formation of young people’s value orientations. The constructive and destructive components of the impact can underlie the further development and implementation of youth policy at the level of the philosophical concept and legislation.","authors":["N.I.
