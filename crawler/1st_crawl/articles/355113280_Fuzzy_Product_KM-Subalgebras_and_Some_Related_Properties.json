{"id":"355113280_Fuzzy_Product_KM-Subalgebras_and_Some_Related_Properties","abstract":"The concept of KM-algebras has been originated in 2019. KM-algebra is a generalization of some of the B-algebras such as BCK, BCI, BCH, BE, and BV and also d-algebras. KM-algebra serves two purposes in mathematics and computer science as follows: a tool for application in both fields and a strategy for creating the foundations. On the fuzziness of KM-algebras, an innovative perspective on fuzzy product KM-algebras as well as some related features is offered. Moreover, the notion of KMM-ideals is described and also initiated the concept of the KM-Cartesian product of fuzzy KM-algebras, and related outcomes are examined. Some of the innovative results in fuzzy KMM-ideals and KM-Cartesian product of fuzzy KM-subalgebras are analyzed, and some are as follows: arbitrary intersection of fuzzy KMM-ideals is again a fuzzy KMM-ideal, order reversing holds true in every KMM-ideal, every fuzzy KM-subalgebra is a fuzzy KMM-ideal, and KM-Cartesian product of two fuzzy KM-subalgebras is again a fuzzy KM-subalgebra.","authors":["K.Kalaiarasi Kalaichelvan","V Mani Mozhi Manimozhi","Nasreen Kausar","Dragan Pamucar"],"meta":["October 2021Complexity 2021(1):1-8","DOI:10.1155/2021/3991871"],"references":["346227441_On_BV-Algebras","330514201_FUZZY_DOT_HYPER_KU-IDEALS","317305313_Sub_implicative_ideals_of_KU-Algebras","316454572_On_BI-algebras","279766317_Fuzzy_dot_subalgebras_and_fuzzy_dot_ideals_of_B-algebras","341992123_Fuzzy_Sets_in_KM-algebras","329388900_A_FUZZY_DOT_b-IDEALS_OF_b-ALGEBRAS","329388885_1Fuzzy_beta_subalgebras_of_beta_algebras","284631669_On_BCH-algebras","276179431_FUZZY_DOT_beta-IDEALS_OF_beta-ALGEBRAS","270006685_Fuzzy_Dot_Structure_of_-algebras","269987309_Fuzzy_Dot_Structure_of_BG-algebras","268262210_Fuzzy_dot_BCKBCI-algebras","265318157_On_BG-algebras","268627491_Fuzzy_dot_b-subalgebras_of_b-algebras"]}
