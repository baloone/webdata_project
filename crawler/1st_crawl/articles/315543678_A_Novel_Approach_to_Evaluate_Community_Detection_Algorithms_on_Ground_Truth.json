{"id":"315543678_A_Novel_Approach_to_Evaluate_Community_Detection_Algorithms_on_Ground_Truth","abstract":"Evaluating\na community detection\nalgorithm\nis a complex task due to the lack of a shared and universally accepted definition of community. In literature, one of the most common way to assess the performances of a community detection algorithm is to compare its output with given ground truth communities by using computationally expensive metrics (i.e., Normalized Mutual Information). In this paper we propose a novel approach aimed at evaluating the adherence of a community partition to the ground truth: our methodology provides more information than the state-of-the-art ones and is fast to compute on large-scale networks. We evaluate its correctness by applying it to six popular community detection algorithms on four large-scale network datasets. Experimental results show how our approach allows to easily evaluate the obtained communities on the ground truth and to characterize the quality of community detection algorithms.","authors":["Giulio Rossetti","Luca Pappalardo","Salvatore Rinzivillo"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-30569-1_10","In book: Complex Networks VII (pp.133-144)","Project: Cimplex (FET Proactive, grant agreement 641191)"],"references":["281320023_Community-centric_analysis_of_user_engagement_in_Skype_social_network","281319799_Interaction_Prediction_in_Dynamic_Networks_exploiting_Community_Discovery","225376634_Mesoscopic_Structure_and_Social_Aspects_of_Human_Mobility","225098636_DEMON_a_Local-First_Discovery_Method_for_Overlapping_Communities","220875979_Detection_of_Overlapping_Communities_in_Dynamical_Social_Networks","51944343_Normalized_Mutual_Information_to_evaluate_overlapping_community_finding_algorithms","1913681_Fast_Unfolding_of_Communities_in_Large_Networks","257799656_Discovering_the_Geographical_Borders_of_Human_Mobility","243220628_How_community_structure_influences_epidemic_spread_in_social_networks","237201507_Overlapping_Social_Network_Communities_and_Viral_Marketing","232771086_Uncovering_the_overlapping_community_structure_of_complex_networks_in_nature_and_society","226422992_A_Classification_for_Community_Discovery_Methods_in_Complex_Networks","225069657_Defining_and_Evaluating_Network_Communities_Based_on_Ground-Truth","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","26720912_Benchmarks_for_testing_community_detection_algorithms_on_directed_and_weighted_graphs_with_overlapping_communities","23464007_Benchmark_graphs_for_testing_community_detection_algorithms","5635994_Maps_of_Random_Walks_on_Complex_Networks_Reveal_Community_Structure"]}
