Results showed that roasting process significantly increased the peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), p-Anisidine value (p-AV), and total oxidation (TOTOX) in scallop lipids. Besides, 16 different aldehydes in scallop lipids were detected using an HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Among them, the content of hexanal, pentanal, nonanal, trans, trans-2,4-octadienal, and 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal increased in a time- and temperature-dependent manner during the roasting process. After roasting at 210 Â°C for 40 min, their content increased by 1.23, 0.81, 1.44, 0.59, and 2.12 folds compared with the unroasted group, respectively. However, pretreatment with AOB effectively prevented aldehyde formation in roasted scallops by reducing the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and scavenging free radicals.","authors":["Yuanyuan Hu","Guan-Hua Zhao","Fawen Yin","Zhongyuan Liu"],"meta":["August 2021Food Chemistry 369(11):130936","DOI:10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130936"],"references":["349301759_Effect_of_Different_Cooking_Methods_on_Lipid_Content_and_Fatty_Acid_Profiles_of_Mytilus_galloprovincialis","341155604_Formation_and_Inhibition_of_Lipid_Alkyl_Radicals_in_Roasted_Meat","336576553_Limited_Antioxidant_Effect_of_Rosemary_in_Lipid_Oxidation_of_Pan-Fried_Salmon","336546228_Effect_of_Heating_on_Compositional_Characteristics_and_Oxidative_Stability_of_Crude_and_Refined_Rice_Bran_Oil","326593444_Profiling_of_Omega-Polyunsaturated_Fatty_Acids_and_Their_Oxidized_Products_in_Salmon_after_Different_Cooking_Methods","284720747_The_changes_in_the_volatile_aldehydes_formed_during_the_deep-fat_frying_process","269400479_Effect_of_carvacrol_on_the_oxidative_stability_of_palm_oil_during_frying","248511136_Emissions_of_volatile_aldehydes_from_heated_cooking_oils","230784615_Enhancing_Oxidative_Stability_of_Sunflower_Oil_during_Convective_and_Microwave_Heating_Using_Grape_Seed_Extract","223779476_Effects_of_different_cooking_methods_on_the_oxidation_proximate_and_fatty_acid_composition_of_Silver_catfish_Rhamdia_quelen_fillets","10137262_A_Simple_Method_for_the_Isolation_and_Purification_of_Total_Lipides_from_Animal_Tissues","352729291_Simultaneous_quantification_of_24_aldehydes_and_ketones_in_oysters_Crassostrea_gigas_with_different_thermal_processing_procedures_by_HPLC-electrospray_tandem_mass_spectrometry","346782520_Evaluation_of_glycerol_core_aldehydes_formation_in_edible_oils_under_restaurant_deep_frying","343408163_Structural_and_physical_properties_of_carboxymethyl_cellulosegelatin_films_functionalized_with_antioxidant_of_bamboo_leaves","339522969_Polyunsaturated_Fatty_Acid_Deuteration_against_Neurodegeneration","336574968_Effects_of_temperature_and_heating_time_on_the_formation_of_aldehydes_during_the_frying_process_of_clam_assessed_by_an_HPLC-MSMS_method","333691282_Effects_of_hazelnut_skin_addition_on_the_cooking_antioxidant_and_sensory_properties_of_chicken_burgers","333239116_Effects_of_natural_phenolics_on_shelf_life_and_lipid_stability_of_freeze-dried_scallop_adductor_muscle","330597572_Nutritional_Quality_of_Edible_Marine_Bivalves_from_the_Southern_Coast_of_Italy_Mediterranean_Sea","326726748_Proximate_fatty_acids_and_metals_in_edible_marine_bivalves_from_Italian_market_Beneficial_and_risk_for_consumers_health","326136732_Changes_in_Lipid_Profiles_of_Dried_Clams_Mactra_chinensis_Philippi_and_Ruditapes_philippinarum_during_Accelerated_Storage_and_Prediction_of_Shelf_Life","324931192_Bamboo_A_rich_source_of_natural_antioxidants_and_its_applications_in_the_food_and_pharmaceutical_industry","320745629_Effect_of_different_cooking_conditions_on_the_profiles_of_Maillard_reaction_products_and_nutrient_composition_of_hairtail_Thichiurus_lepturus_fillets","320406946_Effects_of_different_cooking_methods_on_the_lipids_and_volatile_components_of_farmed_and_wild_European_sea_bass_Dicentrarchus_labrax","317097495_Model_Studies_on_the_Effect_of_Aldehyde_Structure_on_Their_Selective_Trapping_by_Phenolic_Compounds","309819624_Effects_of_boiling_and_roasting_on_proximate_composition_lipid_oxidation_fatty_acid_profile_and_mineral_content_of_two_sesame_varieties_commercialized_and_consumed_in_Far-North_Region_of_Cameroon","293016828_Protein_and_lipid_oxidation_in_meat_A_review_with_emphasis_on_high-pressure_treatments","275060751_Chinese_red_pepper_Zanthoxylum_bungeanum_Maxim_leaf_extract_as_natural_antioxidants_in_salted_silver_carp_Hypophthalmichthys_molitrix_in_dorsal_and_ventral_muscles_during_processing","266798820_Extrusion_of_Antarctic_krill_Euphausia_superba_meal_and_its_effect_on_oil_extraction","264317675_Changes_in_fatty_acids_and_volatile_components_in_mackerel_by_broiling","258828135_Effect_of_different_cooking_methods_on_minerals_vitamins_and_nutritional_quality_indices_of_kutum_roach_Rutilus_frisii_kutum","230040197_Storage_stability_of_microencapsulated_seal_blubber_oil","229541598_Influence_of_heating_time_and_oxygen_availability_on_lipid_oxidation_in_meat_emulsions","227722642_Natural_Antioxidants_Sources_Compounds_Mechanisms_of_Action_and_Potential_Applications","51777828_Chemical_and_sensory_characterisation_of_pan-fried_pork_flavour_Interactions_between_raw_meat_quality_ageing_and_frying_temperature","45114756_Lipid_Oxidation_and_Improving_the_Oxidative_Stability"]}
