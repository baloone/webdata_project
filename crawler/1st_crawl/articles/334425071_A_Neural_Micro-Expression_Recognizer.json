{"id":"334425071_A_Neural_Micro-Expression_Recognizer","abstract":"Recognizing micro-expressions underpins significant and critical research and significant application. We\nspeculate that this problem requires the understanding of the\nsubtle face movement, integration of face structures and a\nsolution of limited training data. In this paper, we build an\neffective micro-expression recognition system that leverages\ntechniques stemming from these speculations. First, we introduce an optical flow method based on the onset frame and\nthe apex frame to encode the subtle face motion. This has\nalready been validated by prior research. Second, to obtain\ndiscriminative representations from the rigid face structures,\npart-based average pooling is proposed to inject structure priors\nto the network. Finally, because the system suffers from small\ntraining sets, we propose to transfer domain knowledge from\nmacro-expression recognition tasks to micro-expression recognition. Specifically, we adopt two domain adaptation techniques\nincluding adversarial training and expression magnification\nand reduction (EMR). Through experiment, we show that the\nproposed system achieves very competitive results on the 2nd\nMicro-Expression Grand Challenge (MEGC).","authors":["Yuchi Liu","Heming Du","Liang Zheng","Tom Gedeon"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1109/FG.2019.8756583","Conference: 2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2019)"],"references":["330601512_A_Boost_in_Revealing_Subtle_Facial_Expressions_A_Consolidated_Eulerian_Framework","325638548_From_Macro_to_Micro_Expression_Recognition_Deep_Learning_on_Small_Datasets_Using_Transfer_Learning","321325809_Beyond_Part_Models_Person_Retrieval_with_Refined_Part_Pooling","320395034_Dual_Temporal_Scale_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Micro-Expression_Recognition","319312130_Objective_Classes_for_Micro-Facial_Expression_Recognition","305994579_Spontaneous_Facial_Micro-Expression_Recognition_using_Discriminative_Spatiotemporal_Local_Binary_Pattern_with_an_Improved_Integral_Projection","303821975_Less_is_More_Micro-expression_Recognition_from_Video_using_Apex_Frame","277333816_Domain-Adversarial_Training_of_Neural_Networks","264419855_One_Millisecond_Face_Alignment_with_an_Ensemble_of_Regression_Trees","259961099_CASME_II_An_Improved_Spontaneous_Micro-Expression_Database_and_the_Baseline_Evaluation","236120477_CASME_Database_a_dataset_of_spontaneous_micro-expressions_collected_from_neutralized_faces","224165246_The_Extended_Cohn-Kanade_Dataset_CK_A_complete_dataset_for_action_unit_and_emotion-specified_expression","221111102_Recognising_spontaneous_facial_micro-expressions","334713122_Spatiotemporal_Recurrent_Convolutional_Networks_for_Recognizing_Spontaneous_Micro-Expressions","325635522_Enriched_Long-Term_Recurrent_Convolutional_Network_for_Facial_Micro-Expression_Recognition","320373402_Dual_Temporal_Scale_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Micro-Expression_Recognition","319649103_Domain-Adversarial_Training_of_Neural_Networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","304006679_SAMM_A_Spontaneous_Micro-Facial_Movement_Dataset","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","282832875_A_Main_Directional_Mean_Optical_Flow_Feature_for_Spontaneous_Micro-Expression_Recognition","266204110_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_by_Backpropagation","261498201_A_Spontaneous_Micro-expression_Database_Inducement_collection_and_baseline","6397809_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Local_Binary_Patterns_with_an_Application_to_Facial_Expressions"]}
