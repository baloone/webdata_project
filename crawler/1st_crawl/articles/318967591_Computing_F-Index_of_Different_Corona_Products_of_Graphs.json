{"id":"318967591_Computing_F-Index_of_Different_Corona_Products_of_Graphs","abstract":"F-index of a graph is equal to the sum of cubes of degree of all the vertices of a given graph. Among different products of graphs, as corona product of two graphs is one of most important, in this study, the explicit expressions for F-index of different types of corona product of are obtained.","authors":["Nilanjan De"],"meta":["August 2017Bulletin of Mathematical Sciences and Applications 19:24-30","DOI:10.18052/www.scipress.com/BMSA.19.24"],"references":["327230978_F-INDEX_OF_TOTAL_TRANSFORMATION_GRAPHS","308964862_F-index_and_coindex_of_some_derived_graphs","305075800_Computing_the_F-index_of_nanostar_dendrimers","296641932_The_F-coindex_of_some_graph_operations","287216940_Modified_Eccentric_Connectivity_Index_and_Polynomial_of_Corona_Product_of_Graphs","283121789_Reformulated_First_Zagreb_Index_of_Some_Graph_Operations","281463623_Total_Eccentricity_Index_of_the_Generalized_Hierarchical_Product_of_Graphs","304163623_F-index_of_Total_Transformation_Graphs","295547634_F-Index_of_some_graph_operations","272388112_A_forgotten_topological_index"]}
