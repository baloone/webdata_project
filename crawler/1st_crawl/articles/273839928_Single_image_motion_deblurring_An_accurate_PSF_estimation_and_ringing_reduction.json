{"id":"273839928_Single_image_motion_deblurring_An_accurate_PSF_estimation_and_ringing_reduction","abstract":"In this paper we have proposed a single image motion deblurring algorithm that is based on a novel use of dual Fourier spectrum combined with bit plane slicing algorithm and Radon transform (RT) for accurate estimation of PSF parameters such as, blur length and blur angle. Even after very accurate PSF estimation, the deconvolution algorithms tend to introduce ringing artifacts at boundaries and near strong edges. To prevent this post deconvolution effect, a post processing method is also proposed in the framework of traditional Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution algorithm. Experimental results evaluated on the basis of both qualitative and quantitative (PSNR, SSIM) metrics, verified on the dataset of both grayscale and color blurred images show that the proposed method outperforms the existing algorithms for removal of uniform blur. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods proves the usefulness of the proposed algorithm for deblurring real-life images/photographs.","authors":["Ashwini M.
