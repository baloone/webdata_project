{"id":"224775631_Sorted_Range_Reporting","abstract":"In this paper we consider a variant of the orthogonal range reporting problem\nwhen all points should be reported in the sorted order of their\n$x$-coordinates. We show that reporting two-dimensional points with this\nadditional condition can be organized (almost) as efficiently as the standard\nrange reporting.\nMoreover, our results generalize and improve the previously known results for\nthe orthogonal range successor problem and can be used to obtain better\nsolutions for some stringology problems.","authors":["Yakov Nekrich","Gonzalo Navarro"],"meta":["April 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31155-0_24","SourcearXiv","Conference: Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm Theory"],"references":["226783523_The_Level_Ancestor_Problem_Simplified","319394814_Algorithms_on_strings_trees_and_sequences_computer_science_and_computational_biology","284471379_Range_non-overlapping_indexing_and_successive_list_indexing","262167459_Top-_k_Document_Retrieval_in_Optimal_Time_and_Linear_Space","223142340_Trans-dichotomous_algorithms_for_minimum_spanning_trees_and_shortest_paths","222684148_Rank_and_select_revisited_and_extended","221591128_On_Data_Structures_and_Asymmetric_Communication_Complexity","221590107_Scaling_and_Related_Techniques_for_Geometry_Problems","221543588_Online_Sorted_Range_Reporting","221543362_Efficient_Indexes_for_the_Positional_Pattern_Matching_Problem_and_Two_Related_Problems_over_Small_Alphabets"]}
