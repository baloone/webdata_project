{"id":"258005151_Total_edge_irregularity_strength_of_strong_product_of_two_paths","abstract":"The strong product G 1 ⊠G 2 of graphs G 1 and G 2 is the graph with V(G 1 )×V(G 2 ) as the vertex set and two distinct vertices (x 1 ,x 2 ) and (y 1 ,y 2 ) are adjacent whenever for each i∈{1,2} either x i =y i or x i y i ∈E(G i ). An edge irregular total k-labeling φV∪E→{1,2,⋯,k} of a graph G=(V,E) is a labeling of vertices and edges of G in such a way that for any different edges xy and x ' y ' their weights φ(x)+φ(xy)+φ(y) and φ(x ' )+φ(x ' y ' )+φ(y ' ) are distinct. The total edge irregularity strength is defined as the minimum k for which G has an edge irregular total k-labeling. We have determined the exact value of the total edge irregularity strength of the strong product of two paths P n and P m .","authors":["Ali Ahmad","Martin Bača","Yasir Bashir","Muhammad Kamran Siddiqui"],"meta":["July 2012Ars Combinatoria -Waterloo then Winnipeg- 106:449-459","Project: H-irregularity strengths of graphs"],"references":["261951606_Edge_irregular_total_labeling_of_certain_family_of_graphs","261216173_The_total_edge-irregular_strengths_of_the_corona_product_of_paths_with_some_graphs","220468817_Total_edge_irregularity_strength_of_trees","259975357_On_total_edge_irregularity_strength_of_the_grid","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","228526618_On_graph_irregularity_strength","220549005_On_the_irregularity_strength_of_trees","220548844_On_a_conjecture_about_edge_irregular_total_labelings","220533083_A_Tight_Bound_on_the_Irregularity_Strength_of_Graphs","220192623_The_irregularity_strength_and_cost_of_the_union_of_cliques"]}
