{"id":"229091426_Automatic_Flight_Control_Systems","abstract":"The practice of relying on full-time operation of automatic flight control systems (AFCS) to ensure the efficiency and safety of commercial passenger and cargo aircraft is now firmly established. However, the complexity of such AFCS has become very great. The concern that remains in accepting the effectiveness of such AFCS systems in all flight situations relates to the uncertainty which can affect pilots in an emergency situation at some moment when their knowledge of the exact nature of the control actions being taken by the AFCS is imprecise and which may bring with it a fatal lack of confidence in the system.","authors":["Donald McLean"],"meta":["January 1990Measurement and Control -London- Institute of Measurement and Control- 36(6)","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-00839-9_14","Publisher: Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, USAISBN: 0130540080"],"references":["326612874_A_flatness_based_control_synthesis_of_linear_systems_and_application_to_windshield_wipers","313059134_Standard_bases_of_differential_ideals_in_Applied_Algebra_Algebraic_Algorithms_and_Error-Correcting_Codes","288988897_Modelling_and_Nonlinear_Control_of_an_Overhead_Crane","288262596_An_introduction_to_nonlinear_model_predictive_control","285513052_Sur_les_systemes_non_lineaires_differentiellement_plats","279252647_Aircraft_control_using_flatness","277247883_Invariant_Manifolds","266453443_Systems_without_drift_and_flatness","266453442_Endogenous_feedbacks_and_equivalence","318286811_Linearization_by_prolongations_New_bounds_for_three_input_systems","313398542_A_classification_of_linear_controllable_systems","309629827_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","300928265_Bifurcations","294684340_Differential_Equations_with_Discontinuous_Righthand_Sides","285237495_Sur_l'equivalence_absolue_de_certains_systemes_d'equations_differentielles_et_sur_certaines_familles_de_courbes","284813872_Mathematische_Probleme","284210727_Invariants_of_dynamic_feedback_and_free_systems","275810939_Foundations_of_Differential_Geometry_Volume_I","268681014_Fondements_du_l'analyse_moderne","268668916_Bifurcations_and_catastrophes_Geometry_of_solutions_to_nonlinear_problems_Transl_from_the_French_by_David_Chillingworth","268651538_Geometrie_Differentielle_et_Mecanique_Analytique","268626304_Lie-Backlund_Transformations_in_Applications","267334617_Free_Rings_and_their_Relations","267198509_Flatness_of_nonlinear_control_systems_a_Cartan-Kahler_Approach","267174063_Geometrie_differentielle_et_systemes_exterieurs","267171809_On_Hilbert's_22nd_problem","267014265_On_Linearization_of_Control_Systems","266979119_Differential_equations_with_discontinuous_right-hand_sides_and_differential_inclusions","266728532_Modern_Aircraft_Flight_Control","266432666_An_invariant_manifold_approach_for_robust_control_design_and_applications","266270882_Theory_of_Lie_Groups","266064254_Equations_differentielles_ordinaires","265766304_On_Jacobi's_bound_for_systems_of_differential_polynomials","265697267_Partial_Differential_Control_Theory_and_Causality","265461715_State-Space_and_Multivariable_Theory","265438572_Singular_perturbation_methods_in_control_Analysis_and_design","265367179_Jacobi's_problem_on_the_order_of_a_system_of_differential_equations","265359935_Linear_Multivariable_System","264859571_Foundations_of_Mechanics","264813895_Electronic_windshield_wiper_system_II_Control_and_sensitivity_study","259674117_A_treatise_on_the_analytical_dynamics_of_particles_and_rigid_bodies","258217433_Differential_equations_dynamical_systems_and_linear_algebra","257913253_Transformation_Groups_Applied_to_Mathematical_Physics","255823668_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","248118788_Topology_from_a_differential_viewpoint","246776354_Mathematical_Control_Theory_Deterministic_Finite_Dimensional_Systems_Springer","246227974_Foundations_of_Differential_Geometry_Volume_I_and_Volume_II","246061900_Encyclopaedia_of_Mathematical_Sciences","245916423_Differential_Equations_with_Discontinuous_Right-Hand_Side","245642089_Chapitres_suppl'ementaires_de_la_th'eorie_des_'equations_di_'erentielles_ordinaires","245217637_Some_basic_structural_properties_of_generalized_linear_system","244423475_Design_for_multi-input_nonlinear_systems","243783022_Equations_Di_erentielles_Ordinaires","243782236_On_di_erentially_flat_nonlinear_systems","243764881_Geometric_Singular_Perturbation_Theory_Ordianary_Differential_Equations"]}
