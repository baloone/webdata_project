{"id":"238877283_Asymptotic_Optimization_of_a_Nonlinear_Hybrid_System_Governed_by_a_Markov_Decision_Process","abstract":"We consider in this paper a continuous time stochastic hybrid control system with finite time horizon. The objective is to minimize a nonlinear function of the state trajectory. The state evolves according to a nonlinear dynamics. The parameters of the dynamics of the system may change at discrete times lε, l=0,1,⋯, according to a controlled Markov chain which has finite state and action spaces. Under the assumption that ε is a small parameter, we justify an averaging procedure allowing us to establish that our problem can be approximated by the solution of some deterministic optimal control problem.","authors":["Eitan Altman","Vladimir Gaitsgory"],"meta":["November 1997SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization 35(6)","DOI:10.1137/S0363012995279985"],"references":["316270747_Theory_of_Suboptimal_Decisions","314394317_Dynamic_Programming_and_Markov_Potential_Theory","285520995_Concerning_a_theorem_of_N_N_Bogolyubov","268492472_Deterministic_and_Stochastic_Optimal_Control","265438572_Singular_perturbation_methods_in_control_Analysis_and_design","262249173_Rate_of_Convergence_of_Empirical_Measures_and_Costs_in_Controlled_Markov_Chains_and_Transient_Optimality","261321653_Singularly_perturbed_Markov_control_problem_limiting_average_cost","250893133_Finite_state_markovian_decision_processes_with_weak_and_strong_interactions","247074436_Optimization_and_NonSmooth_Analysis","243771068_Weak_Convergence_Methods_and_Singularly_Perturbed_Stochastic_Control_and_Filtering_Problems"]}
