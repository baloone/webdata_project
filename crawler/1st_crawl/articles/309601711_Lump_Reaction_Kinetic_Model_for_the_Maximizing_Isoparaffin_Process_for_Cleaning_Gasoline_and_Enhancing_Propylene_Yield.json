{"id":"309601711_Lump_Reaction_Kinetic_Model_for_the_Maximizing_Isoparaffin_Process_for_Cleaning_Gasoline_and_Enhancing_Propylene_Yield","abstract":"Maximizing iso-paraffins process for cleaning gasoline and enhancing propylene yield (MIP-CGP) is the main derived technology of catalytic cracking in China. Based on the reaction mechanism of catalytic cracking and the characteristics of MIP-CGP with two reaction zones, 8-lump reaction kinetic model was established. The measured data was from the industrial unit. 22 groups of kinetic parameters were estimated, and the model parameters were validated that the predicted values were close to measured values. The analysis of the reaction rate constants and activation energies showed that the model parameters can well reflect the reaction law. The model can predict the main products distribution and provide the referential value for the operation optimization of MIP-CGP technology.","authors":["Hongbo Jiang","Shuai Huang"],"meta":["October 2016Energy & Fuels 30(12):10770-10776","DOI:10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b02208"],"references":["259140713_Prediction_of_gasoline_yield_in_a_fluid_catalytic_cracking_FCC_riser_using_k-epsilon_turbulence_and_4-lump_kinetic_models_A_computational_fluid_dynamics_CFD_approach","226570537_7-lump_kinetic_model_for_residual_oil_catalytic_cracking","297149883_Lumped_model_for_heavy_oil_catalytic_cracking_reaction_I_Establishment_of_the_model","293692571_Catalytic_cracking_technology_for_producing_naphtha_with_clean_gasoline_composition_and_increasing_propylene","292869856_Technology_for_reducing_olefin_in_cracked_naphta_-_FDFCC_process","289368967_FCC_reaction_for_heavy_oil_with_TSRFCC-I_technology","287162630_Study_and_application_of_kinetic_model_of_two-stage_riser_FCC-maximizing_diesel_and_gasoline_technology","286628564_Lumping_kinetic_model_for_new_catalytic_cracking_of_MIP_process","286628492_Lumping_kinetic_model_of_heavy_oil_catalytic_cracking_for_MIP_technology","282598596_Quantitative_correlations_of_cracking_performance_with_physiochemical_properties_of_FCC_catalysts_by_a_novel_lump_kinetic_modelling_method","280780206_A_modified_FCC_process_MIP_for_maximizing_iso-paraffins_in_cracked_naphtha","239916560_Simulation_of_catalytic_cracking_process","231373075_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_an_Industrial_Fluid_Catalytic_Cracking_Riser_Reactor_Using_a_Lump-Kinetic_Model_for_a_Distinct_Feedstock","231295456_A_Model_of_Catalytic_Cracking_Conversion_in_Fixed_Moving_and_Fluid-Bed_Reactors","229677611_Kinetics_of_catalytic_cracking_selectivity_in_fixed_moving_and_fluid_bed_reactors","223670689_Application_of_a_Single-Event_Kinetic_Model_in_the_Simulation_of_an_Industrial_Riser_Reactor_for_the_Catalytic_Cracking_of_Vacuum_Gas_Oil"]}
