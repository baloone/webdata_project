{"id":"309242296_Internet_of_Things_based_Smart_Environments_State-of-the-art_Taxonomy_and_Open_Research_Challenges","abstract":"The rapid advancements in communication technologies and the explosive growth of the Internet of Things have enabled the physical world to invisibly interweave with actuators, sensors, and other computational elements while maintaining continuous network connectivity. The continuously connected physical world with computational elements forms a smart environment. A smart environment aims to support and enhance the abilities of its dwellers in executing their tasks, such as navigating through unfamiliar space and moving heavy objects for the elderly, to name a few. Researchers have conducted a number of efforts to use IoT to facilitate our lives and to investigate the effect of IoT-based smart environments on human life. This article surveys the state-of-the-art research efforts to enable IoT-based smart environments. We categorize and classify the literature by devising a taxonomy based on communication enablers, network types, technologies, local area wireless standards, objectives, and characteristics. Moreover, the article highlights the unprecedented opportunities brought about by IoT-based smart environments and their effect on human life. Some reported case studies from different enterprises are also presented. Finally, we discuss open research challenges for enabling IoT-based smart environments.","authors":["Ejaz Ahmed","Ibrar Yaqoob","Abdullah Gani","Muhammad Imran"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Wireless Communications 23(5)","DOI:10.1109/MWC.2016.7721736"],"references":["283023520_Proactive_architecture_for_Internet_of_Things_IoTs_management_in_smart_homes","280157569_IoT-based_Occupancy_Monitoring_Techniques_for_Energy-Efficient_Smart_Buildings","271741147_A_survey_of_wireless_technologies_coexistence_in_WBAN_Analysis_and_open_research_issues","271202877_SAFIR_Secure_access_framework_for_IoT-enabled_services_on_smart_buildings","270880243_Smart_e-Health_Gateway_Bringing_Intelligence_to_Internet-of-Things_Based_Ubiquitous_Healthcare_Systems","313527692_A_survey_of_wireless_technologies_coexistence_in_wban_analysis_and_open_research_issues","309725967_Smart_factories_in_industry_40_a_review_of_the_concept_and_of_energy_management_approached_in_production_based_on_the_Internet_of_things_paradigm","308546378_Automatic_Generation_of_Social_Relationships_between_Internet_of_Things_in_Smart_Home_Using_SDN-Based_Home_Cloud","274249276_Smart_Factories_in_Industry_40_A_Review_of_the_Concept_and_of_Energy_Management_Approached_in_Production_Based_on_the_Internet_of_Things_Paradigm","269309086_Adaptive_rule_engine_based_IoT_enabled_remote_health_care_data_acquisition_and_smart_transmission_system"]}
