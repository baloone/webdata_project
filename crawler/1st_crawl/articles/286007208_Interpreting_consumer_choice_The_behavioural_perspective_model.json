{"id":"286007208_Interpreting_consumer_choice_The_behavioural_perspective_model","abstract":"Interpretive consumer research usually proceeds with a minimum of structure and preconceptions. This book presents a more structured approach than is usual, showing how a simple framework that embodies the rewards and costs associated with consumer choice can be used to interpret a wide range of consumer behaviours from everyday purchasing and saving, innovative choice, imitation, 'green' consumer behavior, to compulsive behaviors such as addictions (to shopping, to gambling, to alcohol and other drugs, etc). Foxall takes a qualitative approach to interpreting behavior, focusing on the epistemological problems that arise in such research and emphasizing the emotional as well as cognitive aspects of consumption. The author argues that consumer behaviour can be understood with the aid of a very simple model that proposes how the consequences of consumption impact consumers' subsequent choices. The objective is to show that a basic model can be used to interpret consumer behaviour in general, not in isolation from the marketing influences that shape it, but as a course of human choice that is dynamically linked with managerial concerns.","authors":["Gordon Foxall"],"meta":["September 2009","DOI:10.4324/9780203866894"],"references":["273877606_Do_We_Need_Critical_Relativism_Comments_on_On_Method_in_Consumer_Research","267923358_Positivism_and_Paradigm_Dominance_in_Consumer_Research_Toward_Critical_Pluralism_and_Rapprochement","258132637_Decelerating_Environmentally_Destructive_Lawn-Walking","247857295_An_experimental_analysis_of_anti-litter_procedures1","247857001_Prompting_a_consumer_behavior_for_pollution_control1","235305319_Marketing's_Domain","232482657_Some_fundamentals_of_B_F_Skinner's_behaviorism","313571890_A_description_of_the_Erhard_seminars_training_est_in_the_terms_of_behavior_analysis","312971109_The_Place_of_the_Human_Subject_in_the_Operant_Laboratory","312458211_Applied_behavior_analysis_and_environmental_psychology_From_strange_bedfellows_to_a_productive_marriage","293183672_Consumer_choice_as_an_evolutionary_process_An_operant_interpretation_of_adopter_behavior","293107238_Coordination_and_transformation_An_overview_of_structures_behaviours_and_change_in_evolutionary_environments","293088028_CONSERVATION_INFORMATION_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS_AND_ELECTRICITY_CONSUMPTION_IN_AN_APARTMENT_COMPLEX","291905874_Psychological_contributions_to_transportation","288518268_The_bottle_bill_effect_on_grocery_stores'_costs","288254205_Situationist_theory_and_consumer_behavior","284853860_Naturalistic_humanistic_and_interpretive_inquiry_Challenges_and_ultimate_potential","284759254_Interpretive_and_hermeneutic_research_methods_in_the_contextualistic_analysis_of_verbal_behavior","284545137_Awareness_rules_and_propositional_control_A_confrontation_with_S-R_behavior_theory","284394529_The_determinants_of_innovative_behavior_with_respect_to_a_branded_frequently_purchased_food_product","284372892_Verbal_Control_in_Human_Operant_Behavior","284210471_Images_of_man_in_contemporary_behaviourism","284064788_Logical_positivism_and_the_social_sciences","284034542_Biological_constraints_on_conditioning","281506557_Research_to_accelerate_the_diffusion_of_a_new_invention","281020561_Consumer_innovativeness_Novelty-seeking_creativity_and_cognitive_style","275621404_The_Effects_of_Monetary_Rebates_and_Daily_Feedback_on_Electricity_Conservation","274671823_Reducing_Electricity_Consumption_of_Residents_Living_in_Mass-Metered_Dormitory_Complexes","274347328_Response_Maintenance_and_Paper_Recycling","273053762_A_Striking_Characteristic_of_Innovators","271778320_Patterns_of_Store_Choice","267922968_A_Clarification_and_Extension_of_Operant_Conditioning_Principles_in_Marketing","256353177_A_multi-attribute_diffusion_model_for_forecasting_the_adoption_of_investment_alternatives_for_consumers","254322724_Beyond_marketing_The_diffusion_of_entrepreneurship_in_the_modern_corporation","249257877_Interpretation_and_Objectivity","247718701_Promoting_Gasoline_ConservationThe_Effects_of_Reinforcement_Schedule_a_Leader_and_Self-Recording","247494921_The_consumer_situation_An_integrative_model_for_research_in_marketing","243785072_Economics_According_to_the_Rats_and_Pigeons_Too_What_Have_We_Learned_and_What_Can_We_Hope_to_Learn","240793230_Prompting_Turning-Out_Lights_in_Unoccupied_Rooms","240300280_An_experimental_analysis_of_electricity_conservation_procedures1","240283524_Call_for_papers_Special_issue_of_Marketing_Theory_on_intentionality_in_the_explanation_of_consumer_and_marketer_behaviour","235362917_Relativism_for_Consumer_Research_Comments_on_Anderson","235362772_Realism_or_Relativism_for_Marketing_Theory_and_Research_A_Comment_on_Hunt's_Scientific_Realism","235361827_Relative_to_What_-_That_is_the_Question_A_Reply_to_Siegel","234837316_Large_Group_Awareness_Training","233822574_Cognitive_science_and_behaviorism","232865006_Energy_savings_in_interstate_transportation_through_feedback_and_reinforcement","232521578_Transdermal_Interpretation_of_the_Subject_Matter_of_Behavior_Analysis","232517750_Effects_of_intermittent_and_continuous_token_reinforcement_on_bus_ridership","232428548_Ten_inner_causes","230499019_A_NOTE_ON_THE_MANAGEMENT_OF_'COMMONS'","229682532_Hermeneutics_and_the_hypothetico-deductive_method","229472339_Marketing_New_Technology_Markets_Hierarchies_and_User-Initiated_Innovation","228011903_The_Scientific_Study_of_Lingustic_Behaviour_A_Perspective_on_the_Skinner-Chomsky_Controversy1","227086101_Skinner_on_the_Prediction_and_Control_of_Behavior"]}
