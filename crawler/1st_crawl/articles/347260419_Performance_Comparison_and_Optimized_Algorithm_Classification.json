{"id":"347260419_Performance_Comparison_and_Optimized_Algorithm_Classification","abstract":"The current development of technology is quite rapidly not disengaged in a large\ndata processor covering of all areas such as information technology, computer science, medicine,\nfinance and other. This brings a large computing effect in identifying the processing of data. In\ndata analysis for very large data, data processing is very much needed, in this study the authors\npropose data mining method as a solution to a large data processing problem, data mining is\ndivided into several techniques including classification method techniques that aims to classify\nlarge amounts of data to be relevant data information. In this study the authors compared\n5 algorithms in the classification method to get better performance in classification problems.\nResearchers analyze and test 5 Algorithm classifications with 4 different datasets as a tool in the\nproblem of large data classification. .The results of this research show the method SVM is much\nbetter to be used 4 comparison methods in calculating the value of AUC by using 4 datasets of\nUCI Repository. The LSVT Dataset shows the highest AUC value with 0973, Ionsphere 0887,\nSonar 0897, Heartstatlog 0868","authors":["Dedi Saputra","Weishky Steven Dharmawan","Mochamad Wahyudi","Windi Irmayani"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1641:012087","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1641/1/012087"],"references":["312463714_Knowledge_discovery_in_databases_An_overview","260439499_Credal-C45_Decision_tree_based_on_imprecise_probabilities_to_classify_noisy_data","260329055_Fault_diagnosis_of_power_transformers_using_multi-class_least_square_support_vector_machines_classifiers_with_particle_swarm_optimisation","220230701_Combining_integrated_sampling_with_SVM_ensembles_for_learning_from_imbalanced_datasets","31723938_Decision_Support_Systems_and_Intelligent_Systems_E_Turban_JE_Aronson_colaboracion_de_N_Bolloju"]}
