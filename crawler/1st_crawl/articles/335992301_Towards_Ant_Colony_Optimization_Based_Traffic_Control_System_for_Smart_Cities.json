{"id":"335992301_Towards_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Based_Traffic_Control_System_for_Smart_Cities","abstract":"The various advents in the field of computer science and the need of technology urge the humans to find solutions to various challenges. One amongst them is solving the combinatorial optimization problems under the domain of problem solving approach. In order to meet the requirements of such stochastic problems, we need an alternative which is both optimal as well as near to being efficient. This paper gives an insight to what an ACO is, how it originated, and how ACO helps in stimulating the production of feasible solutions for day-today problems. The need of ACO in the trending smart city approach is analysed and discussed. A glimpse of recent research contribution towards using ACO in Traffic control justifies the selection of ACO over other algorithms. The paper concludes what methodology to incorporate to overcome the shortcomings of ACO and further its operability and utility in the development of a smart city network.","authors":["Farheen Siddiqui","Tabeen Afzal","Sameena Naaz"],"meta":["April 2019"],"references":["312931238_A_Green_Ant-Based_method_for_Path_Planning_of_Unmanned_Ground_Vehicles","299446858_Performance_Comparison_of_Simulated_Annealing_GA_and_ACO_Applied_to_TSP","318657548_Increasing_Route_Availability_in_Internet_of_Vehicles_Using_Ant_Colony_Optimization","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","278399525_Ant-based_vehicle_congestion_avoidance_system_using_vehicular_networks","266619919_A_comparative_study_of_the_improvement_of_performance_using_a_PSO_modified_by_ACO_applied_to_TSP","263033768_Metaheuristic_Algorithm_for_Robotic_Path_Planning","261192562_smartPATH_A_hybrid_ACO-GA_algorithm_for_robot_path_planning","222428912_Blum_C_Ant_colony_optimization_Introduction_and_recent_trends_Phys_Life_Reviews_2_353-373"]}
