{"id":"256429787_Coefficient_reduction_for_knapsack-like_constraints_in_0-1_programs_with_variable_upper_bounds","abstract":"The notion of coefficient reduction is extended for 0–1 knapsack-like constraints by taking advantage of the special structure of variable bounding constraints. Our procedure produces reductions not detected by myopic coefficient reduction methods.","authors":["Brenda Dietrich","Laureano F.
