{"id":"246273032_Fundamentals_of_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval","abstract":"We introduce in this chapter some fundamental theories for content-based image retrieval. Section 1.1 looks at the development of content-based image retrieval techniques. Then, as the emphasis of this chapter, we introduce in detail in Section 1.2 some widely used methods for visual content descriptions. After that, we briefly address similarity/distance measures between visual features, the indexing schemes, query formation, relevance feedback, and system performance evaluation in Sections 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5. Details of these techniques are discussed in subsequent chapters. Finally, we draw a conclusion in Section 1.6.","authors":["Fuhui Long","Hongjiang Zhang","David Dagan Feng Feng"],"meta":["January 2002","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-05300-3_1"],"references":["227300095_NeTra_A_toolbox_for_navigating_large_image_databases","220979865_The_QBIC_Project_Querying_Images_by_Content_Using_Color_Texture_and_Shape","220632088_Index-based_object_recognition_in_pictorial_data_management","336734582_Maximum_likelihood_parameter_estimation_of_textures_using_a_wold-decomposition_based_model","313708771_The_R-tree_An_efficient_and_robust_access_method_for_points_and_rectangles","313072608_Blobworld_A_system_for_region-based_image_indexing_and_retrieval","312869587_A_relational_database_system_for_images","305295728_A_Retrieval_Technique_for_Similar_Shapes","292812531_Complete_discrete_2-d_gabor_transforms_by_neural_networks_for_image_analysis_and_compression","290804337_Shape_discrimination_using_Fourier_descriptors","283921280_Visual_Pattern_Recognition_by_Moment_Invariants","269502940_Recent_Advances_in_Descriptive_Multivariate_Analysis","262156243_State_of_the_Art_in_Shape_Matching","260908490_Computer_Graphics_Principles_and_Practice_in_C","260290143_Efficient_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval","259703614_Visual_Information_Retrieval","254752948_Interactive_segmentation","252518800_Shape-similarity-based_retrieval_in_image_database_systems","250754890_7_Orthogonal_decompositions_of_2D_random_fields_and_their_applications_for_2D_spectral_estimation","248537940_2D_B_-_string_a_spatial_knowledge_represen_-_tation_for_image_database_systems","243784383_Invariant_features_for_discriminating_between_equivalence_classes","243661354_Using_texture_for_image_retrieval","243658833_A_method_of_defining_the_similarity_of_images_on_the_basis_of_color_information","243472958_Representation_And_Retrieval_Of_Symbolic_Pictures_Using_Generalized_2D_Strings","240039186_Image_retrieval_based_on_color_features_An_evaluation_study","238692512_Video_and_Image_Processing_in_Multimedia_Systems","238684297_Textures_a_photographic_album_for_artists_and_designers","234863584_ISTSPIE's_Symposium_on_Electronic_Imaging_Science_and_Technology","232655683_Edge_Flow_A_Framework_of_Boundary_Detection_and_Image_Segmentation","226238228_Efficient_and_Effective_Querying_by_Image_Content","224773181_The_Quadtree_and_Related_Heiarchical_Data_Structures","224769102_Iconic_Indexing_by_2-D_Strings","223673272_Texture_classification_and_segmentation_using_multiresolution_simultaneous_autoregressive_models","223247105_2D_C-string_A_new_spatial_knowledge_representation_for_image_database_systems","222738212_A_Comparative_Study_of_Texture_Measures_with_Classification_Based_on_Feature_Distributions","222498922_Image_Retrieval_Current_Techniques_Promising_Directions_and_Open_Issues","222473546_Content-based_image_retrieval_by_viewpoint-invariant_color_indexing","222305666_Generation_of_moment_invariants_and_their_uses_for_character_recognition","221677990_Fundamental_of_Digital_Image_Processing","221572842_A_Signature_for_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval_Using_a_Geometrical_Transform","221264675_Dimension_Reduction_of_Texture_Features_for_Image_Retrieval_using_Hybrid_Associative_Neural_Networks","221214275_A_Retrieval_Technique_for_Similar_Shapes","221146742_Filter_Image_Browsing_-_Exploiting_Interaction_in_Image_Retrieval","220979664_Virage_image_search_engine_an_open_framework_for_image_management","220979603_Scheme_for_Visual_Feature-Based_Image_Indexing","220979597_Content-Based_Retrieval_in_Multimedia_Imaging","220979569_Shape_Analysis_for_Image_Retrieval","220688577_Introduction_To_Modern_Information_Retrieval","220659589_Photobook_Content-Based_Manipulation_of_Image_Databases","220599004_Image_database_systems_A_survey","220225069_The_Grid_File_An_Adaptable_Symmetric_Multikey_File_Structure","220182992_Texture_Features_for_Browsing_and_Retrieval_of_Image_Data","220072278_Image_Information_Systems_Where_Do_We_Go_From_Here","44411610_The_design_and_analysis_of_spatial_data_structures_Hanan_Samet","30874367_The_K-D-B-Tree_A_Search_Structure_of_Large_Multidimensional_Dynamic_Indexes"]}
