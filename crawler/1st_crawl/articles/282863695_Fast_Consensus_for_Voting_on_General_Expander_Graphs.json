{"id":"282863695_Fast_Consensus_for_Voting_on_General_Expander_Graphs","abstract":"Distributed voting is a fundamental topic in distributed computing. In the standard model of pull voting, at each step every vertex chooses a neighbour uniformly at random and adopts its opinion. The voting is completed when all vertices hold the same opinion. In the simplest case, each vertex initially holds one of two different opinions. This partitions the vertices into arbitrary sets A and B. For many graphs, including regular graphs and irrespective of their expansion properties, if both A and B are sufficiently large sets, then pull voting requires \\(\\Omega (n)\\) expected steps, where n is the number of vertices of the graph.","authors":["Colin Cooper","Robert Els√§sser","Tomasz Radzik","Nicolas Rivera"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-48653-5_17","Conference: International Symposium on Distributed Computing"],"references":["258631568_Probabilistic_consensus_via_polling_and_majority_rules","314819130_A_proof_of_alon's_second_eigenvalue_conjecture","313571219_Weighted_voting_for_replicated_dataA","297472255_Distributed_probabilistic_polling_and_applications_to_proportionate_agreement","261988788_The_Power_of_Two_Choices_in_Distributed_Voting","249413168_On_the_Laplacian_Eigenvalues_of_Gn_p","248019473_The_spectra_of_random_graphs_with_expected_degrees","239667611_On_the_Complexity_of_Cooperative_Solution_Concepts","238216570_Design_and_Analysis_of_Fault_Tolerant_Digital_System","236736804_On_the_method_of_bounded_differences"]}
