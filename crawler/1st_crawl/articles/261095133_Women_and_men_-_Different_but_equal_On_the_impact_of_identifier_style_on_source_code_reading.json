{"id":"261095133_Women_and_men_-_Different_but_equal_On_the_impact_of_identifier_style_on_source_code_reading","abstract":"Program comprehension is preliminary to any program evolution task. Researchers agree that identifiers play an important role in code reading and program understanding activities. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, only one work investigated the impact of gender on the memorability of identifiers and thus, ultimately, on program comprehension. This paper reports the results of an experiment involving 15 male subjects and nine female subjects to study the impact of gender on the subjects' visual effort, required time, as well as accuracy to recall Camel Case versus Underscore identifiers in source code reading. We observe no statistically-significant difference in term of accuracy, required time, and effort. However, our data supports the conjecture that male and female subjects follow different comprehension strategies: female subjects seem to carefully weight all options and spend more time to rule out wrong answers while male subjects seem to quickly set their minds on some answers, possibly the wrong ones. Indeed, we found that the effort spent on wrong answers is significantly higher for female subjects and that there is an interaction between the effort that female subjects invested on wrong answers and their higher percentages of correct answers when compared to male subjects.","authors":["Zahra Sharafi","Zéphyrin Soh","Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc","Giuliano Antoniol"],"meta":["June 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICPC.2012.6240505","Conference: Program Comprehension (ICPC), 2012 IEEE 20th International Conference on"],"references":["265451711_The_Evaluation_of_Information_Visualisation_Techniques_Using_Eye_Tracking","259118316_TAUPE_Visualizing_and_analyzing_eye-tracking_data","317837054_Statistics_and_Computing","314751074_Regression_Analysis_by_Example","312455832_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","274015857_Team_RDCR_A_Language_And_Environment_For_Statistical_Computing_R_Foundation_for_Statistical_Computing_Vienna_Austria","269855920_Cannibals_and_Kings_The_Origins_of_Cultures","265166265_Applied_Logistic_Regressio","264966288_Regression_Analysis_By_Example","254007935_An_eye-tracking_study_on_the_role_of_scan_time_in_finding_source_code_defects","240278615_Factorial_Validity_of_a_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Scale_and_the_Impact_of_Computer_Training","224159770_An_Eye_Tracking_Study_on_camelCase_and_under_score_Identifier_Styles","243767757_Gender_differences_in_information_processing_a_selectivity_interpretation","233821342_Cannibals_and_Kings_The_Origins_of_Cultures","228002219_The_Effects_of_Auditor_Gender_and_Task_Complexity_on_Information_Processing_Efficiency"]}
