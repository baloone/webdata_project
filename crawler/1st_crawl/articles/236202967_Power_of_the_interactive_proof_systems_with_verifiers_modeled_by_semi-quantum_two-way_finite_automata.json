{"id":"236202967_Power_of_the_interactive_proof_systems_with_verifiers_modeled_by_semi-quantum_two-way_finite_automata","abstract":"In this paper we explore the power of AM for the case that verifiers are {\\em\ntwo-way finite automata with quantum and classical states} (2QCFA)--introduced\nby Ambainis and Watrous in 2002--and the communications are classical. It is of\ninterest to consider AM with such \"semi-quantum\" verifiers because they use\nonly limited quantum resources. Our main result is that such Quantum\nArthur-Merlin proof systems (QAM(2QCFA)) with polynomial expected running time\nare more powerful than in the case verifiers are two-way probabilistic finite\nautomata (AM(2PFA)) with polynomial expected running time. Moreover, we prove\nthat there is a language which can be recognized by an exponential expected\nrunning time QAM(2QCFA), but can not be recognized by any AM(2PFA), and that\nthe NP-complete language $L_{knapsack}$ can also be recognized by a QAM(2QCFA)\nworking only on quantum pure states using unitary operators.","authors":["Shenggen Zheng","Jozef Gruska","Daowen Qiu"],"meta":["April 2013Information and Computation 241","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2015.02.003","SourcearXiv"],"references":["264906610_Quantum_Finite_Automata","262272875_1-way_quantum_finite_automata_Strengths_weaknesses_and_generalizations","225044826_Turing-equivalent_automata_using_a_fixed-size_quantum_memory","222402827_Two-way_finite_automata_with_quantum_and_classical_state","221663743_State_succinctness_of_two-way_finite_automata_with_quantum_and_classicalstates","221212400_Quantum_Computing_1-Way_Quantum_Automata","51963946_Some_Languages_Recognized_by_Two-Way_Finite_Automata_with_Quantum_andClassical_States","24142472_Succinctness_of_two-way_probabilistic_and_quantum_finite_automata","3785029_1-way_quantum_finite_automata_strengths_weaknesses_andgeneralizations","2203786_Characterizations_of_1-Way_Quantum_Finite_Automata","273674251_The_Knowledge_Complexity_of_Interactive_Proof_Systems","259695465_Interactive_Proofs_with_Quantum_Finite_Automata","236950043_A_new_family_of_nonstochastic_languages_Communicated_by","236647771_On_the_complexity_of_minimizing_probabilistic_and_quantum_automata","236609372_Characterizations_of_one-way_general_quantum_finite_automata","231178777_Quantum_finite_automata_with_control_language","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","227307484_Probabilistic_game_automata","227071827_An_Application_of_Quantum_Finite_Automata_to_Interactive_Proof_Systems_Extended_Abstract","225510214_Algebraic_Results_on_Quantum_Automata","223091366_An_Application_of_Quantum_Finite_Automata_to_Interactive_Proof_Systems","222577903_PSPACE_has_constant-round_quantum_interactive_proof_systems","222556747_Quantum_Automata_and_Quantum_Grammars","222437957_A_Lower_Bound_for_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Finite_State_Machines","221591869_Private_Coins_versus_Public_Coins_in_Interactive_Proof_Systems","221590876_Trading_Group_Theory_for_Randomness","220617699_A_Time_Complexity_Gap_for_Two-Way_Probabilistic_Finite-State_Automata","220616649_The_Knowledge_Complexity_of_Interactive_Proof_System","220574643_Probabilistic_Game_Automata","220520585_Descriptional_Complexity_Issues_in_Quantum_Computing","220432172_IP_PSPACE","220431647_Finite_State_Verifiers_I_The_Power_of_Interaction","216301243_Introduction_to_Probabilistic_Automata","45930442_Unbounded-error_quantum_computation_with_small_space_bounds","45884867_Characterizations_of_one-way_general_quantum_finite_automata","3832166_PSPACE_has_constant-round_quantum_interactive_proof_systems","3770655_A_Lower_Bound_For_Probabilistic_Algorithms_For_Finite_State_Machines","3728293_On_the_power_of_quantum_finite_state_automata","2333366_A_Time_Complexity_Gap_For_2-Way_Probabilistic_Finite_State_Automata","2200496_Some_Observations_on_Two-Way_Finite_Automata_with_Quantum_and_Classical_States","1920365_Quantum_Computational_Complexity"]}
