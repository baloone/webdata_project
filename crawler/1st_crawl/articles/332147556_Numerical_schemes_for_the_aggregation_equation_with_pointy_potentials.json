{"id":"332147556_Numerical_schemes_for_the_aggregation_equation_with_pointy_potentials","abstract":"The aggregation equation is a nonlocal and nonlinear conservation law commonly used to describe the collective motion of individuals interacting together. When interacting potentials are pointy, it is now well established that solutions may blow up in finite time but global in time weak measure valued solutions exist. In this paper we focus on the convergence of particle schemes and finite volume schemes towards these weak measure valued solutions of the aggregation equation.","authors":["Benoît Fabréges","Héléne Hivert","Kévin Le Balch","Sofiane Martel"],"meta":["January 2019ESAIM Proceedings and Surveys 65:384-400","DOI:10.1051/proc/201965384"],"references":["263773957_Non-local_kinetic_and_macroscopic_models_for_self-organised_animal_aggregations","260250506_A_Finite-Volume_Method_for_Nonlinear_Nonlocal_Equations_with_a_Gradient_Flow_Structure","258288711_Blow-up_in_multidimensional_aggregation_equations_with_mildly_singular_interaction_kernels","320075192_Convergence_analysis_of_upwind_type_schemes_for_the_aggregation_equation_with_pointy_potential","314353490_Analysis_and_Simulation_of_Nonlinear_and_Nonlocal_Transport_Equations","301846982_Convergence_order_of_upwind_type_schemes_for_transport_equations_with_discontinuous_coefficients","265511839_The_Filippov_characteristic_flow_for_the_aggregation_equation_with_mildly_singular_potentials","262641028_A_Blob_Method_for_the_Aggregation_Equation","260604726_Numerical_Methods_for_One-Dimensional_Aggregation_Equations","259803779_Equivalence_between_duality_and_gradient_flow_solutions_for_one-dimensional_aggregation_equations"]}
