{"id":"304593857_Output_feedback_stabilization_for_discrete-time_systems_under_limited_communication","abstract":"This paper addresses the output feedback stabilization problem for discrete-time networked control systems with imperfect input channels, i.e., the controller-actuator channels, where both quantization error and packet dropout are involved. A stabilizability condition is first derived for the single-input-single-output (SISO) case. It is shown that stabilization over quantized lossy channel actually involves a trade-off between robust stability control and robust performance control. Furthermore, the results are expanded to triangularly decoupled multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems and a necessary and sufficient condition is deduced, which also exhibits a compromise between robust stability control and robust performance control in the individual channel as echoing the SISO case.","authors":["Yu Feng","Xiang Chen","Guoxiang Gu"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 62(4):1927-1932","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2016.2582875"],"references":["295858438_Observer-based_stabilizing_controllers_for_discrete-time_systems_with_quantized_signal_and_multiplicative_random_noise","271526995_Multiobjective_Output-feedback_Control_Via_LMI_Optimization","327208426_Stabilization_of_networked_multi-input_systems_with_channel_resource_allocation","312813579_Control_over_network_Using_actuation_buffers_to_reduce_transmission_frequency","306107190_Optimal_control_of_LTI_systems_over_unreliable_communications_links","284024684_Stability_of_networked_control_systems","273847074_Stabilization_of_two-input_two-output_systems_over_SNR-constrained_channels","262316882_Multiobjective_boldmathHtHf_Control_Design","261622363_An_algebraic_approach_to_decoupling_in_linear_multivariable_systems","261397405_Output_Feedback_Stabilization_for_Networked_Control_Systems_with_Quantized_Fading_Actuating_Channels"]}
