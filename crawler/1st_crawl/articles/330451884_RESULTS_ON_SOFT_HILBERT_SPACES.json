{"id":"330451884_RESULTS_ON_SOFT_HILBERT_SPACES","abstract":"Molodtsov [6] introduced the notion of soft set which can be considered as a new mathematical approach for vagueness. Das and Samanta [8] first defined the soft vector space and soft norm. Yazar and et al. [9] defined the soft vector space by using the concept of soft point given in [4, 5] and introduced the soft normed spaces in a new point of view. In the present paper, We give some properties of soft inner product spaces and present some examples for soft inner product spaces. Soft Hilbert space is introduced and some related properties are investigated. Finally, soft˜2soft˜ soft˜2 space is given as an example for soft Hilbert spaces.","authors":["Murat Ibrahim Yazar","Cigdem Gunduz Aras","S Bayramov"],"meta":["January 2019","Project: Estimation of The Vocational High School Students’ Science Courses Academic Achievements With Artificial Neural Network and Precautions to Avoid Failure ( Turkey and Malaysia Comparison)"],"references":["315768066_Operators_on_soft_inner_product_spaces_II","273445510_Soft_linear_operators_in_soft_normed_linear_spaces","273445505_On_soft_inner_product_spaces","272027951_Operators_on_Soft_Inner_Product_Spaces","268995256_Soft_real_sets_soft_real_numbers_and_their_properties","255173951_On_soft_linear_spaces_and_soft_normed_linear_spaces","222782394_Soft_set_theory-First_results","316517871_On_soft_expert_metric_spaces","273445486_Soft_metric","265080187_Applications_of_soft_sets_in_hilbert_algebras"]}
