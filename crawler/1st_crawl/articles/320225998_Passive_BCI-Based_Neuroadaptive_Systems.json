{"id":"320225998_Passive_BCI-Based_Neuroadaptive_Systems","abstract":"Passive brain-computer interfaces have been formally introduced and defined almost a decade ago, and have gained considerable attention since then. Here, we provide a new perspective on this field. We refer to neuroadaptive systems, and identify a key aspect with regards to which various passive BCI-based systems differ from each other: interactivity. With increased interactivity, the systems become increasingly responsive, autonomous, and capable to adapt to the user. We give an overview of four separate categories of interactivity using examples of past and current research. This categorisation of passive BCI-based neuroadaptive systems helps identify and pinpoint relevant human-computer interaction aspects and possibilities for future neuroadaptive technology and research.","authors":["Laurens Ruben Krol","Thorsten O.
