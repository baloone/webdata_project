{"id":"267695891_Almost_Cover-Free_Codes_and_Designs","abstract":"An $s$-subset of columns of a binary code is said to be an $(s,\\ell)$-bad\nsubset of columns if there exists a subset of other $\\ell$ columns in the code\nsuch that the conjunction of $\\ell$ columns is covered by the disjunctive sum\nof $s$ columns. A binary code is called a cover-free $(s,\\ell)$-code if there\nis no $(s,\\ell)$-bad subset of columns in the code.\nIn this paper, we introduce a natural probabilistic generalization of\ncover-free $(s,\\ell)$-code, namely: a binary code is said to be an almost\ncover-free $(s,\\ell)$-code if almost all $s$ subsets are not $(s,\\ell)$-bad. We\ndiscuss the concept of almost cover-free $(s,\\ell)$-codes arising in\ncombinatorial group testing problems connected with the nonadaptive search of\ndefective supersets. We develop a random coding method based on the standard\nensemble of binary codes to obtain lower bounds on the capacity and error\nprobability exponent of such codes. For the considered ensemble our lower\nbounds are asymptotically tight.","authors":["Arkadii Dâ€™yachkov","Ilya Vorobyev","Nikita Polyanskii","Vladislav Shchukin"],"meta":["January 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 82(1-2):231-247","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0279-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["305272195_Erratum_to_Bounds_on_the_rate_of_disjunctive_codes","267627282_Symmetric_Disjunctive_List-Decoding_Codes","263811664_Almost_Disjunctive_List-Decoding_Codes","259954173_Lectures_on_Designing_Screening_Experiments","308856183_Almost_cover-free_codes_and_designs","308829267_Symmetric_disjunctive_list-decoding_codes","269269431_Bounds_on_the_rate_of_superimposed_codes","268310740_New_Applications_and_Results_of_Superimposed_Code_Theory_Arising_from_the_Potentialities_of_Molecular_Biology","266063828_Information_Theory_Coding_Theorems_for_Discrete_Memoryless_Systems","262168448_Multiple-access_hyperchannel","246473105_Information_theory_Coding_Theorems_for_Discrete_Memoryless_Systems","242959929_The_separating_property_of_random_matrices","242797901_Universal_decoding_for_random_design_of_screening_experiments","227012026_Sets_pooling_designs","225124554_Families_of_finite_sets_in_which_no_set_is_covered_by_the_union_ofr_others"]}
