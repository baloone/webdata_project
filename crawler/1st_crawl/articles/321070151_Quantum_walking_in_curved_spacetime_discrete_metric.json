{"id":"321070151_Quantum_walking_in_curved_spacetime_discrete_metric","abstract":"A discrete-time quantum walk (QW) is essentially a unitary operator driving the evolution of a single particle on the lattice. Some QWs have familiar physics PDEs as their continuum limit. Some slight generalization of QWs (allowing for prior encoding and larger neighbourhoods) even have the curved spacetime Dirac equation, as their continuum limit. In the $(1+1)-$dimensional massless case, this equation decouples as scalar transport equations with tunable speeds. We characterise and construct all those QWs that lead to scalar transport with tunable speeds. The local coin operator dictates that speed; we investigate whether a finite number of coins is enough to generate all speeds, and whether their arrangement can be controlled by background signals travelling at lightspeed. The interest of such a discretization is twofold : to allow for easier experimental implementations on the one hand, and to evaluate ways of quantizing the metric field, on the other.","authors":["Pablo Arrighi","Giuseppe Di Molfetta","Stefano Facchini"],"meta":["November 2017Quantum 2","DOI:10.22331/q-2018-08-22-84"],"references":["304788986_Quantum_Walks_as_simulators_of_neutrino_oscillations_in_vacuum_and_matter","303326629_Quantum_walking_in_curved_spacetime","301896307_Quantum_walks_and_non-Abelian_discrete_gauge_theory","258250524_Propagation_of_Quantum_Walks_in_Electric_Fields","316024729_Fermion_confinement_via_quantum_walks_in_21-dimensional_and_31-dimensional_space-time","307636321_Quantum_walks_and_gravitational_waves","307564242_Quantum_walking_in_curved_spacetime_31_dimensions_and_beyond","293662955_Overhead_and_noise_threshold_of_fault-tolerant_quantum_error_correction","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers","257201485_Decoupled_Quantum_Walks_models_of_the_Klein-Gordon_and_wave_equations"]}
