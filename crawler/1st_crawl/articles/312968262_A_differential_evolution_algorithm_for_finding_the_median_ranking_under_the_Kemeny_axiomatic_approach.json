{"id":"312968262_A_differential_evolution_algorithm_for_finding_the_median_ranking_under_the_Kemeny_axiomatic_approach","abstract":"In recent years the analysis of preference rankings has become an increasingly important topic. One of the most important tasks in dealing with preference rankings is the identification of the median ranking, namely that ranking that best represents the preferences of a population of judges. This task is known\nwith several alternative names, such as rank aggregation problem, consensus ranking problem, social choice problem. In this paper we propose a Differential Evolution algorithm for the Consensus Ranking detection (DECoR) within the Kemenyâ€™s axiomatic framework. The algorithm works with full, partial and incomplete rankings. A simulation study shows that our proposal is particularly feasible when working with a very large number of objects to be ranked, because it is accurate and also faster than other proposals. Some\napplications on real data sets shows the practical utility of our proposal in helping the users in taking decisions.","authors":["Antonio D'Ambrosio","Giulio Mazzeo","Carmela Iorio","Roberta Siciliano"],"meta":["January 2017Computers & Operations Research 82","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2017.01.017"],"references":["291355884_A_Recursive_Partitioning_Method_for_the_Prediction_of_Preference_Rankings_Based_Upon_Kemeny_Distances","287589131_Clustering_Search_Applied_to_Rank_Aggregation","283808033_Two_algorithms_for_finding_optimal_solutions_of_the_Kemeny_rank_aggregation_problem_for_full_rankings","282751998_Clustering_and_Prediction_of_Rankings_Within_a_Kemeny_Distance_Framework","246648860_Differential_Evolution_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Adaptive_Scheme_for_Global_Optimization_Over_Continuous_Spaces","236611402_Optimal_consensus_ranking_using_SLS_An_approach_and_an_application","224301628_Enhanced_differential_evolution_hybrid_scatter_search_for_discrete_optimization","221654253_Algorithms_for_discovering_bucket_orders_from_data","221603356_A_Computational_Study_of_the_Kemeny_Rule_for_Preference_Aggregation","221345873_Cluster_analysis_of_heterogeneous_rank_data","221230135_Consensus_measures_generated_by_weighted_Kemeny_distances_on_weak_orders","220741010_A_comparative_study_of_differential_evolution_variants_for_global_optimization","328303311_Analyzing_and_Modeling_Rank_Data","321621351_Branch-and-Bound_Applications_in_Combinatorial_Data_Analysis","321609562_Probability_Models_and_Statistical_Analyses_for_Ranking_Data","312119709_Partial_evaluation_in_Rank_Aggregation_Problems","307534542_Algorithm_AS_136_A_K-means_vlustering_algorithm","281370481_Accurate_algorithms_for_identifying_the_median_ranking_when_dealing_with_weak_and_partial_rankings_under_the_Kemeny_axiomatic_approach","279940918_Aggregation_of_Partial_Rankings_-_An_Approach_Based_on_the_Kemeny_Ranking_Problem","277538539_Tackling_the_rank_aggregation_problem_with_evolutionary_algorithms","276275927_Mathematics_Without_Numbers","276275835_Preference_ranking_An_axiomatic_approach","276275613_Essai_sur_l'Application_de_L'Analyse_a_la_Probabilite_des_Decisions_Rendues_a_la_Pluraliste_des_Voix_Paris","276275611_Memoire_sur_les_Elections_au_Scrutin","268683544_The_number_of_orderings_of_n_candidates_when_ties_are_permitted","267146365_Differential_evolution_A_handbook_for_global_permutation-based_combinatorial_optimization_With_CD-ROM","266955542_Committee_approach_to_priority_planning_The_median_ranking_method","266316819_Modern_Multidimensional_Scaling_Theory_and_Applications_Springer_Series_in_Statistics","264957299_An_axiomatic_approach_to_distance_on_partial_orders","260558352_Model-based_clustering_for_multivariate_partial_ranking_data","254286789_Multistage_Ranking_Models","251514452_Experiments_with_Kemeny_ranking_What_works_when","243771513_Analyzing_and_Modeling_Rank_Data","243081574_Non-Null_Ranking_Models_I","242552401_Social_Choice_and_Individual_Values","242512892_A_New_Measure_of_Rank_Correlation","239727257_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","236177855_Adaption_in_Natural_and_Artificial_Systems_An_Introductory_Analysis_with_Applications_to_Biology_Control_and_AI","234766725_An_introduction_to_differential_evolution","229963339_A_new_rank_correlation_coefficient_with_application_to_the_consensus_ranking_problem","222402359_A_preference_aggregation_method_through_the_estimation_of_utility_intervals","221345339_Decision_tree_and_instance-based_learning_for_label_ranking","220472263_Creating_a_consensus_ranking_of_proposals_from_reviewers'_partial_ordinal_rankings","220471771_Some_Heuristics_for_the_Consensus_Ranking_Problem","220110411_A_randomized_approximation_algorithm_for_computing_bucket_orders","220049369_A_K-means_Clustering_Algorithm_Algorithm_AS_136","220045421_Optimization_by_simulated_annealing","200110355_Rank_Aggregation_Methods_for_the_Web","51893594_Learning_to_Order_Things","44735828_A_generative_model_for_rank_data_based_on_insertion_sort_algorithm","24063502_Geometric_representation_of_association_between_categories","2909127_Nantonac_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_Based_on_Order_Responses","38359817_Generalized_Permutation_Polytopes_and_Exploratory_Graphical_Methods_for_Ranked_Data","30847708_Genetic_Algorithms_and_Machine_Learning","4897368_Mixtures_of_distance-based_models_for_ranking_data"]}
