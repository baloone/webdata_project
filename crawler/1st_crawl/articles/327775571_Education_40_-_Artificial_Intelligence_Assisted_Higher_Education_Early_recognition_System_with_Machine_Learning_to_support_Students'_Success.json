{"id":"327775571_Education_40_-_Artificial_Intelligence_Assisted_Higher_Education_Early_recognition_System_with_Machine_Learning_to_support_Students'_Success","abstract":"Education 4.0 is being empowered more and more by artificial intelligence (AI) methods. We observe a continuously growing demand for adaptive and personalized Education. In\nthis paper we present an innovative approach to promoting AI in Education 4.0. Our first contribution is AI assisted Higher Education Process with smart sensors and wearable devices for self-regulated learning. Second we describe our first results of Education 4.0 didactical methods implemented with learning analytics and machine learning methods. The aim of this case study is to predict the final score of students before participating\nin final examination. We propose an early recognition system equipped with real data captured in a blended learning course with a personalized test at the beginning of the semester, an adaptive learning environment based on Auto Tutor by N. A. Crowder theory with adaptive self-assessment feedback for reinforcement learning. It is obvious that focusing on studentsâ€™ success and their experiences is a win-win scenario for students\nand professors as well as for the administration.\nonline available at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8599203\nElectronic ISBN: 978-1-5386-5577-1\nPage 23-30","authors":["Monica Ciolacu","Ali Fallah Tehrani","Paul Svasta","Leon Binder"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1109/SIITME.2018.8599203","Conference: IEEE, SIITME 2018At: Iasi, RomaniaVolume: 2018 IEEE 24th International Symposium for Design and Technology in Electronic Packaging (SIITME)","Project: Education 4.0"],"references":["326494400_Learning_Lab_Digital_Technologies_-_Concept_Streams_and_Experiences","325824488_Intelligent_Education_Assistant_Powered_by_Chatbots","323953138_Biometrics_Accessibility_challenge_or_opportunity","322882071_Emotion_detection_using_noninvasive_low_cost_sensors","322586183_An_overview_of_adaptive_e-learning_systems","322375325_A_wearable-enhanced_fitness_program_for_older_adults_combining_fitness_trackers_and_gamification_elements_the_pilot_study_fMOOCHome","319235469_Emotion_Detection_Using_Noninvasive_Low_Cost_Sensors","318886019_Consumers'_adoption_of_wearable_technologies_literature_review_synthesis_and_future_research_agenda","263143165_Automatic_Essay_Assessment","260684981_How_do_students_self-regulate_Review_of_Zimmerman's_cyclical_model_of_self-regulated_learning","259969289_Penetrating_the_Fog_Analytics_in_Learning_and_Education","224226607_Next_smart_sensors_generation","33693590_Affective_learning_companions_strategies_for_empathetic_agents_with_real-time_multimodal_affective_sensing_to_foster_meta-cognitive_and_meta-affective_approaches_to_learning_motivation_and_perseveranc","325150891_Virtually_enhancing_the_real_world_with_holograms_An_exploration_of_expected_gratifications_of_using_augmented_reality_smart_glasses","324748117_EPICSAVE_-_Enhancing_Vocational_Training_for_Paramedics_with_Multi-user_Virtual_Reality","322586175_Education_40_-_Fostering_student's_performance_with_machine_learning_methods","322585764_Education_40_for_tall_thin_engineer_in_a_data_driven_society","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","317647539_Features_Students_Really_Expect_from_Learning_Analytics","317121311_Improving_a_Mobile_Learning_Companion_for_Self-regulated_Learning_using_Sensors","313163124_Some_studies_in_machine_learning_using_the_game_of_checkers","312986214_Some_studies_in_machine_learning_using_the_game_of_checkers","280751547_Attaining_self-regulation_A_social_cognitive_perspective","277681069_Attaining_Self-Regulation","9652741_Teaching_Machines"]}
