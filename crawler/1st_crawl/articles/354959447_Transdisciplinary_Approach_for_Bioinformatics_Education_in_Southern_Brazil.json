{"id":"354959447_Transdisciplinary_Approach_for_Bioinformatics_Education_in_Southern_Brazil","abstract":"The development and application of bioinformatics has been growing steadily, but its learning and training has been lagging. We have approached this problem through a biannual event, called EGB (Escola Gaúcha de Bioinformática), dedicated to undergraduate and graduate students (mainly from biology, biomedicine, chemistry, physics, and computer sciences), as well as professionals, to mingle and be presented to bioinformatics from sequence, structure, and computational standpoints simultaneously. The interactive environment provided by EGB allows for participants mingling, independently from their training background, fostering collaborative learning and experience exchange. Both lecturers and students are encouraged to collaborate and communicate, with no formal acknowledgement of \"status differentiation\".","authors":["Marcio Dorn","Rodrigo Ligabue-Braun","Hugo Verli"],"meta":["September 2021Frontiers in Education 6(1):399","DOI:10.3389/feduc.2021.725591"],"references":["326839021_A_Brief_History_of_Bioinformatics","325586249_Bioinformatics_core_competencies_for_undergraduate_life_sciences_education","322406982_Assessing_an_effective_undergraduate_module_teaching_applied_bioinformatics_to_biology_students","320146192_A_global_perspective_on_evolving_bioinformatics_and_data_science_training_needs","260610641_Bioinformatics_Curriculum_Guidelines_Toward_a_Definition_of_Core_Competencies","349722187_Want_to_track_pandemic_variants_faster_Fix_the_bioinformatics_bottleneck","343405468_An_instructional_definition_and_assessment_rubric_for_bioinformatics_instruction","295077105_Genomics_Politics_through_Space_and_Time_The_Case_of_Bioinformatics_in_Brazil","51188915_Bioinformatics_Current_practice_and_future_challenges_for_life_science_education","11795905_What_is_Bioinformatics_A_Proposed_Definition_and_Overview_of_the_Field","11393247_Bioinformatics_Science_medicine_and_the_future","6719694_Evolving_research_trends_in_bioinformatics","6423959_The_growth_of_bioinformatics"]}
