A Sigma-Pi neural network (SPNN) is used as the compensator to reduce the model error and improve the system performance in the presence of uncertainties of UAV dynamics, payload and environment. Besides, we present a technical framework for fast and robust implementation of multi-purpose UAV systems, and develop a UAV control system evaluation testbed using a high-precision optical motion capture system. Both the simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the SPNN can reduce inversion errors related to UAV parameter uncertainties as well as tracking errors related to unknown disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. With the help of an online NN learning mechanism, the entire system can achieve much higher accuracy in attitude and trajectory control than conventional PID-based control systems under varying flight conditions.","authors":["Fan Jiang","Farhad Pourpanah","Qi Hao"],"meta":["March 2019IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIE.2019.2905808"],"references":["305319424_Automatic_Tuning_of_Attitude_Control_System_for_Fixed-Wing_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","278038641_Fuzzy_Adaptive_PD_Control_for_Quadrotor_Helicopter","272382631_Robust_Control_of_Four-Rotor_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_With_Disturbance_Uncertainty","261212701_An_adaptive_neuro_PID_for_controlling_the_altitude_of_quadcopter_robot","224453708_Real-time_validation_of_a_dual_neural_network_controller_for_a_low-cost_UAV","224324710_Intelligent_Control_of_UAV_with_Neuron-Fuzzy_Approach_under_Hierarchical_Architecture","221076856_Backstepping_and_Sliding-mode_Techniques_Applied_to_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","313688692_Adaptive_flight_control_for_quadrotor_UAVs_with_dynamic_inversion_and_neural_networks","312942865_Backstepping_and_Sliding-mode_Techniques_Applied_to_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","308852967_Fuzzy_radial_basis_function_neural_network_PID_control_system_for_a_quadrotor_UAV_based_on_particle_swarm_optimization","308501251_Adaptive_RBF_neural_network_controller_design_for_SRM_drives","299997376_Robust_Backstepping_Sliding-Mode_Control_and_Observer-Based_Fault_Estimation_for_a_Quadrotor_UAV","278680601_Quadrotor_Kinematics_and_Dynamics","271479904_A_Neural-Network_based_Flight_Controller_for_UASs","269149723_Comparison_of_Different_Neural_Augmentations_for_the_Fault_Tolerant_Control_Laws_of_the_WVU_YF-22_Model_Aircraft","266011726_Nonlinear_Flight_Control_Using_Neural_Networks","261447968_The_longitudinal_attitude_control_of_UAV_based_on_GPFN_neural_network","261399230_Analysis_of_adaptive_control_using_on-line_neural_networks_for_a_quadrotor_UAV","252039199_Neural_network_based_adaptive_dynamic_inversion_flight_control_system_design","251975003_2DOF_manipulator_tracking_control_based_on_fuzzy_CMAC_neural_network_dynamic_inversion","241190715_Reconfigurable_flight_control_for_UAV_with_multiple_control_effectors_based_on_neural_network_and_dynamic_inversion","232655109_Comparison_of_Different_Neural_Augmentations_for_the_Fault_Tolerant_Control_Laws_of_the_WVU_YF-22_Model_Aircraft","229091419_Aircraft_Control_and_Simulation","220743448_Robust_neuro-control_for_a_micro_quadrotor","40450672_Output_Feedback_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_UAV_Using_Neural_Networks","3823350_Adaptive_nonlinear_controller_synthesis_and_flight_test_evaluation_On_an_unmanned_helicopter","3331736_Robust_flight_control_design_using_dynamic_inversion_and_structured_singular_value_synthesis","2611684_Analysis_Of_Adaptive_Neural_Networks_For_Helicopter_Flight_Controls"]}
