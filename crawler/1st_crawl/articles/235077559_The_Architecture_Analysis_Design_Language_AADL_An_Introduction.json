{"id":"235077559_The_Architecture_Analysis_Design_Language_AADL_An_Introduction","abstract":"In November 2004, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) released the aerospace standard AS5506, named the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL). The AADL is a modeling language that supports early and repeated analyses of a system's architecture with respect to performance-critical properties through an extendable notation, a tool framework, and precisely defined semantics. The language employs formal modeling concepts for the description and analysis of application system architectures in terms of distinct components and their interactions. It includes abstractions of software, computational hardware, and system components for (a) specifying and analyzing real-time embedded and high dependability systems, complex systems of systems, and specialized performance capability systems and (b) mapping of software onto computational hardware elements. The AADL is especially effective for model-based analysis and specification of complex real-time embedded systems. This technical note is an introduction to the concepts, language structure, and application of the AADL.","authors":["Peter H. Feiler","David P.
