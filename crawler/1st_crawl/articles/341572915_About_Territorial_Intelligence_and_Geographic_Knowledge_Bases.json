{"id":"341572915_About_Territorial_Intelligence_and_Geographic_Knowledge_Bases","abstract":"As business intelligence is for companies, territorial intelligence is for local authorities. However, it is not the simple exportation of business intelligence concepts and tools, but overall a new discipline characterized by the amalgamation of collective human intelligence and computer intelligence. As a result, geographic knowledge bases, rules and inference engines are not only based on logic but also on topology, geometry and linguistics, and must take multiple actors’ points of view into account. The scope of this paper will be to present the concepts necessary to construct such systems, i.e. to pass from intelligence to geographic knowledge engineering.","authors":["Robert Laurini","Sylvie Servigne","Franck Favetta"],"meta":["May 2020Cuadernos de Administración 33","DOI:10.11144/Javeriana.cao33.atigk"],"references":["310968014_An_Introduction_to_Geographic_Rule_Semantics","270450436_Geographic_Ontologies_Gazetteers_and_Multilingualism","322616709_Geographic_Knowledge_Infrastructure_Applications_to_Territorial_Intelligence_and_Smart_Cities","318836706_Editorial_Evolving_nature_of_knowledge-based_urban_development","305377306_Business_intelligence_Concepts_components_techniques_and_benefits","295308534_Expert_systems_applications_to_urban_planning","241008809_Place_Names_Ontologies","233350534_A_Ladder_Of_Citizen_Participation","223524903_Comparing_categories_among_geographic_ontologies","223448840_The_promise_of_expert_systems_for_urban_planning"]}
