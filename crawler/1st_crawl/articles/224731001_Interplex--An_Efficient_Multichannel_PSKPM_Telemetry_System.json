{"id":"224731001_Interplex--An_Efficient_Multichannel_PSKPM_Telemetry_System","abstract":"This paper describes a new phase-shift-keyed/phase- modulation (PSK/PM) scheme, called Interplex, which improves the performance of multichannel telemetry systems by reducing the cross-modulation loss. In the case of two-channel systems, the improvement in data power efficiency relative to a conventional system can be as much as 3 dB. A major feature of Interplex is that it can be implemented with very minor modification of existing conventional PSK/PM systems.
