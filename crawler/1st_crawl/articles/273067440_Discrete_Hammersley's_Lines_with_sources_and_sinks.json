Sepp{\\\"a}l{\\\"a}inen for two generalized\nUlam's problems. As a by-product we obtain an elementary solution for the\noriginal Ulam problem. We also prove that for the first process defined on Z,\nBernoulli product measures are the only extremal and translation-invariant\nstationary measures.","authors":["A-L Basdevant","N Enriquez","L Gerin","J-B Gouéré"],"meta":["March 2015Latin American journal of probability and mathematical statistics 13(1)","DOI:10.30757/ALEA.v13-02","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228814673_Lecture_Notes_on_the_Corner_Growth_Model","45875689_The_Discrete_and_Continuum_Broken_Line_Process","38351479_Exact_limiting_shape_for_a_simplified_model_of_first-passage_percolation_on_the_plane","38340052_Increasing_sequences_of_independent_points_on_the_planar_lattice","2142065_Discrete_Orthogonal_Polynomial_Ensembles_and_the_Plancherel_Measure","2120740_Hammersley's_process_with_sources_and_sinks","240053444_Interacting_Particle_Systems","239063199_A_few_seedlings_of_research","222297667_Hydrodynamical_methods_for_analyzing_longest_increasing_subsequences","2448366_Hammersley's_Interacting_Particle_Process_and_Longest_Increasing_Subsequences"]}
