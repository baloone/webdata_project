{"id":"220532934_Irregular_Assignments_of_Trees_and_Forests","abstract":"Let G be a graph on n vertices. An irregular assignment of G is a weighting w:E(G)→{1,...,m} of the edge-set of G such that all weighted degrees w(v)=∑ v∈e w(e) are distinct. The minimal number m for which this is possible is called the irregularity strength s(G) of G. Lehel and others have shown that s(G)<∞ implies s(G)≦n-1 for connected graphs on n≥4 vertices, and s(G)≤2n-3 for arbitrary graphs. By using decompositions for the additive group ℤ r (integers modr), these results are strengthened. Main Theorem: s(G)≤n+1 for any graph with s(G)<∞.","authors":["Martin Aigner","Eberhard Triesch"],"meta":["November 1990SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 3(4):439-449","DOI:10.1137/0403038","SourceDBLP"],"references":[]}
