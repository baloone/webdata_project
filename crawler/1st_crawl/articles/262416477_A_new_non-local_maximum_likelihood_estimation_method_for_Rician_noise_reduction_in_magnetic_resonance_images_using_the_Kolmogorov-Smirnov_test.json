Effective denoising is vital for proper analysis and accurate quantitative measurements from MR images. Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation methods were proved to be very effective in denoising MR images. Among the ML based methods, the recently proposed non-local maximum likelihood (NLML) approach gained much attention. In the NLML method, the samples for the ML estimation of the true underlying intensity are selected in a non-local way based on the intensity similarity of the pixel neighborhoods. This similarity is generally measured using the Euclidean distance. A drawback of this approach is the usage of a fixed sample size for the ML estimation resulting in over- or under-smoothing. In this work, we propose an NLML estimation method for denoising MR images in which the samples are selected in an adaptive and statistically supported way using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) similarity test. The method has been tested both on simulated and real data, showing its effectiveness.","authors":["Jeny Rajan","Arnold J. den Dekker","Jan Sijbers"],"meta":["October 2014Signal Processing 103:16–23","DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2013.12.018","Project: Noise reduction in magnetic resonance images"],"references":["233723965_BOLD_noise_assumptions_in_fMRI","227828114_Adaptive_Non-Local_Means_Denoising_of_MR_Images_With_Spatially_Varying_Noise_Levels","221472398_Segmentation_Based_Noise_Variance_Estimation_from_Background_MRI_Data","51523534_Maximum_likelihood_estimation-based_denoising_of_magnetic_resonance_images_using_restricted_local_neighborhoods","45461833_Noise_measurement_from_magnitude_MRI_using_local_estimates_of_variance_and_skewness","41107019_A_Review_of_Image_Denoising_Algorithms_with_a_New_One","40758090_Adaptive_non-local_means_denoising_of_MR_images_with_spatially_varying_noise_levels","6504908_Automatic_Estimation_of_the_Noise_Variance_from_the_Histogram_of_a_Magnetic_Resonance_Image","5634114_Nonlinear_Anisotropic_Filtering_of_MRI_Data","3327793_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","2503598_Maximum-Likelihood_Estimation_of_Rician_Distribution_Parameters","317019755_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_of_signal_amplitude_and_noise_variance_from_complex_valued_data","313556903_Nonlinear_anisotropic_filtering_of_MRI_data","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","302374300_Mathematical_Analysis_of_Random_Noise","276093465_Principles_and_Imaging_Technologies_of_Magnetic_Resonance_Phase_Imaging","266253420_Fractal_Image_Compression_Theory_and_Application","247131283_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","243765011_On_a_Measure_of_Divergence_between_Two_Statistical_Populations_Defined_by_Their_Probability_Distributions","238265403_Mathematical_analysis_of_random_noise_III-IV","228339020_A_rotationally_invariant_block_matching_strategy_improving_image_denoising_with_non-local_means","221831087_Principles_of_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","220099896_A_Nonlocal_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_Method_for_Rician_Noise_Reduction_in_MR_Images","215722273_Mathematical_Analysis_of_Random_Noise","51949022_A_New_Similarity_Measure_for_Non-Local_Means_Filtering_of_MRI_Images","51406938_Noise_and_signal_estimation_in_magnitude_MRI_and_RICIAN_distributed_images_a_LMMSE_approach","6349008_Maximum_Likelihood_estimation_of_signal","5471912_MRI_denoising_using_Non-Local_Means","2745052_BrainWeb_Online_Interface_to_a_3D_MRI_Simulated_Brain_Database","2679192_BrainWeb_Online_Interface_to_a_3D_MRI_Simulated_Brain_Database"]}
