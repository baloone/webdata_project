{"id":"317254853_An_Enjoyable_Learning_Experience_in_Personalising_Learning_Based_on_Knowledge_Management_A_Case_Study","abstract":"Many attempts at personalisation have been made in education. They all collect learning data and analyse learning behaviours, and ultimately achieve personalised learning dynamically. However, further research is needed on the ways to effectively access and analyse information about learning within an enjoyable environment and with positive results when realising personalised learning. In order to solve this problem, we connect the time in class and after class with semantic knowledge and combine these elements with gamification and a better interaction experience. We explore whether this teaching method can offer students a better learning experience and positive learning outcomes. Our approach plays an obvious role in personalised learning. Our results indicate that a teaching method which connects the two parts of a class with gamification and a means of interaction in AR (augmented reality) produces novel and enjoyable feelings, stimulates students' enthusiasm and improves the learning effects when they do personalised learning.","authors":["Hao Xu"],"meta":["July 2017Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 13(6)","DOI:10.12973/eurasia.2017.00702a"],"references":["300727567_Augmenting_Social_Interactions_Realtime_Behavioral_Feedback_using_Social_Signal_Processing_Techniques","291045044_Bridges_into_the_Unknown_Personalizing_Connections_to_Little-known_Countries","264860703_Case_Studies_and_the_Flipped_Classroom","238444705_Educational_Video_Game_Design_A_Review_of_the_Literature","228841030_Augmented_Reality_An_Overview_and_Five_Directions_for_AR_in_Education","200772522_Review_Knowledge_Management_and_Knowledge_Management_Systems_Conceptual_Foundations_and_Research_Issues","11946306_Self-Determination_Theory_and_the_Facilitation_of_Intrinsic_Motivation_Social_Development_and_Well-Being","3420397_Using_AI_in_knowledge_management_Knowledge_bases_and_ontologies","262358663_The_effect_of_virtual_achievements_on_student_engagement","262250896_From_MOCs_to_SPOCs","261844724_A_case_study_in_the_gamification_of_a_university-level_games_development_course","242379604_CAPA-An_integrated_computer-assisted_personalized_assignment_system","220420650_Designing_games_with_a_purpose"]}
