{"id":"319888174_Effects_of_Flexible_Dry_Electrode_Design_on_Electrodermal_Activity_Stimulus_Response_Detection","abstract":"Objective: \nThe focus of this research is to evaluate the effects of design parameters including surface area, distance between and geometry of dry flexible electrodes on electrodermal activity (EDA) stimulus response detection.\n\nMethods: \nEDA is a result of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) being stimulated, which causes sweat and changes the electrical characteristics of the skin. Standard silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) EDA electrodes are rigid and lack conformability in contact with skin. In this study, flexible dry Ag/AgCl EDA electrodes were fabricated on a compliant substrate and used to monitor EDA stimulus responses and compared results simultaneously collected by rigid dry Ag/AgCl electrodes.\n\nResults: \nA repeatable fabrication process for flexible Ag/AgCl electrodes has been established. Surface area, distance between and geometry of electrodes are shown to effect the detectability of the EDA response and the minimum number of sweat glands to be covered by the electrodes has been estimated at 140, or more, in order to maintain functionality. The optimal flexible EDA electrodes is a serpentine design with a 0.15 cm (2) surface area and a 0.20 cm distance with an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.979Â±0.015.\n\nConclusion: \nFabrication of flexible electrodes is described and an understanding of the effects of electrode designs on the EDA stimulus response detection has been established and is potentially related to the coverage of sweat glands.\n\nSignificance: \nThis work presents a novel systematic approach to understanding the effects of electrode designs on monitoring EDA which is of importance for the design of wearable EDA monitoring devices.","authors":["Peter A.
