{"id":"344246186_An_Overview_of_Query_Processing_on_Crowdsourced_Databases","abstract":"Crowd-sourcing is a powerful solution to correctly answer expensive and unanswered queries in the database. This includes queries on a database with uncertain and incomplete data. The crowd-sourcing attempts to exploit human abilities to process these difficult tasks and workers helped to provide accurate results utilizing the available data in the crowd. The crowd-sourcing database systems (CSDB) combined the ability of the crowd with the relational database by using some variant of the relational database with minor changes. This paper surveys and examines the leading studies conducted on the area of query processing for both traditional and preference queries in crowd-sourcing databases. The focus is given on highlights the strengths and the weakness of each approach. A detailed discussion for the current and future trends research relevant to query processing in the area of crow-sourced databases is also demonstrated.","authors":["Marwa B.
