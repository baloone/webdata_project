{"id":"303868555_A_Generic_Methodology_for_Superstructure_Optimization_of_Different_Processing_Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a generic computer-aided methodology for synthesis of different processing networks using superstructure optimization. The methodology can handle different network optimization problems of various application fields. It integrates databases with a common data architecture, a generic model to represent the processing steps, and appropriate optimization tools. A special software interface has been created to automate the steps in the methodology workflow, allow the transfer of data between tools and obtain the mathematical representation of the problem as required by the optimization tool. The methodology and its implementation have been tested through various case studies.","authors":["Maria-Ona Bertran","Rebecca Frauzem","Lei Zhang","Rafiqul Gani"],"meta":["May 2016Computer Aided Chemical Engineering 38","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-444-63428-3.50119-3","Conference: 26th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering","Project: Chemical Product Design Based on Multi-scale Modeling"],"references":["278026481_Superstructure-based_optimization_of_biorefinery_networks_Production_of_biodiesel","282938007_Synthesis_and_Design_of_Integrated_Process_and_Water_Networks","230727832_Integrated_business_and_engineering_framework_for_synthesis_and_design_of_enterprise-wide_processing_networks"]}
