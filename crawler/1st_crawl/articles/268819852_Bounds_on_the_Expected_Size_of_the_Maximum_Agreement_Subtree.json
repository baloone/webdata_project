{"id":"268819852_Bounds_on_the_Expected_Size_of_the_Maximum_Agreement_Subtree","abstract":"We prove polynomial upper and lower bounds on the expected size of the\nmaximum agreement subtree of two random binary phylogenetic trees under both\nthe uniform distribution and Yule-Harding distribution. This positively answers\na question posed in earlier work. Determining tight upper and lower bounds\nremains an open problem.","authors":["Daniel Irving Bernstein","Lam Si Tung Ho","Colby Long","Mike Steel"],"meta":["November 2014SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 29(4)","DOI:10.1137/140997750","SourcearXiv"],"references":["243780284_Distributions_of_Tree_Comparison_Metrics--Some_New_Results","305982925_The_probabilities_of_rooted_tree-shapes_generated_by_random_bifurcation","261805730_Probabilities_of_n-Trees_Under_Two_Models_A_Demonstration_that_Asymmetrical_Interior_Nodes_are_not_Improbable","259180800_Polya_Urn_Models","249276204_Phylogenetics_-_Charles_Semple_and_Mike_Steel_2003","245340494_Longest_increasing_subsequences_From_patience_sorting_to_the_Baik-Deift-Johansson_theorem","243767769_The_Probabilities_fo_Rooted_Tree-Shapes_Generated_by_Random_Bifurcation","222447091_Kaikoura_tree_theorems_Computing_the_maximum_agreement_subtree","221659659_The_maximum_agreement_subtree_problem","220532833_On_the_Distribution_of_Lengths_of_Evolutionary_Trees"]}
