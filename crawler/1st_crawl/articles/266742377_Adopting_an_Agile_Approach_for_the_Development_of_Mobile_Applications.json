{"id":"266742377_Adopting_an_Agile_Approach_for_the_Development_of_Mobile_Applications","abstract":"ABSTRACT: With the increasing popularity and demand for mobile applications, there has been a significant increase in the number of mobile application development projects. Highly volatile requirements of mobile applications require adaptive software development methods. The Agile approach is seen as \na natural fit for mobile application and there is a need to explore various Agile methodologies for the development of mobile applications. This paper evaluates how adopting various Agile approaches improves the development of mobile applications and if they can be used in order to provide more tailor-made process improvements within an organization. A survey related to mobile application development process improvement was developed. The use of various Agile approaches for success in mobile application development were evaluated by determining the significance of the most used Agile engineering paradigms such as XP, Scrum, and Lean. The findings of the study show that these \nAgile methods have the potential to help deliver enhanced speed and quality for mobile application development.","authors":["Harleen Flora","Xiaofeng Wang","Swati V.
