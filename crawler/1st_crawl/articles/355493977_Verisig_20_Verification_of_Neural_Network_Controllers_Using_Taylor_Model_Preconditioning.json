{"id":"355493977_Verisig_20_Verification_of_Neural_Network_Controllers_Using_Taylor_Model_Preconditioning","abstract":"This paper presents Verisig 2.0, a verification tool for closed-loop systems with neural network (NN) controllers. We focus on NNs with tanh/sigmoid activations and develop a Taylor-model-based reachability algorithm through Taylor model preconditioning and shrink wrapping. Furthermore, we provide a parallelized implementation that allows Verisig 2.0 to efficiently handle larger NNs than existing tools can. We provide an extensive evaluation over 10 benchmarks and compare Verisig 2.0 against three state-of-the-art verification tools. We show that Verisig 2.0 is both more accurate and faster, achieving speed-ups of up to 21x and 268x against different tools, respectively.","authors":["Radoslav Ivanov","Taylor Carpenter","James Weimer","Rajeev Alur"],"meta":["July 2021"],"references":["336422496_ReachNN_Reachability_Analysis_of_Neural-Network_Controlled_Systems","347415613_Verifying_the_Safety_of_Autonomous_Systems_with_Neural_Network_Controllers","341127903_Case_study_verifying_the_safety_of_an_autonomous_racing_car_with_a_neural_network_controller","336431157_Safety_Verification_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_with_Reinforcement_Learning_Control","332285412_Verisig_verifying_safety_properties_of_hybrid_systems_with_neural_network_controllers","332285209_Formal_verification_of_neural_network_controlled_autonomous_systems","332283323_Gray-box_adversarial_testing_for_control_systems_with_machine_learning_components","332278892_Reachability_analysis_for_neural_feedback_systems_using_regressive_polynomial_rule_inference","328457601_Simulation-based_Adversarial_Test_Generation_for_Autonomous_Vehicles_with_Machine_Learning_Components","320037488_Formal_Verification_of_Piece-Wise_Linear_Feed-Forward_Neural_Networks"]}
