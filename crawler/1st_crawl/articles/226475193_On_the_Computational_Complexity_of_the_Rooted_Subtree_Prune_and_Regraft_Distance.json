{"id":"226475193_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_the_Rooted_Subtree_Prune_and_Regraft_Distance","abstract":"The graph-theoretic operation of rooted subtree prune and regraft is increasingly being used as a tool for understanding and modelling reticulation events in evolutionary biology. In this paper, we show that computing the rooted subtree prune and regraft distance between two rooted binary phylogenetic trees on the same label set is NP-hard. This resolves a longstanding open problem. Furthermore, we show that this distance is fixed parameter tractable when parameterised by the distance between the two trees.","authors":["Magnus Bordewich","Charles Semple"],"meta":["January 2005Annals of Combinatorics 8(4):409-423","DOI:10.1007/s00026-004-0229-z","SourceOAI"],"references":["225677744_A_Framework_for_Representing_Reticulate_Evolution","31137863_Gene_Trees_in_Species_Trees","256484410_Private_communication","226495314_On_the_complexity_of_comparing_evolutionary_trees","222598302_Comparison_of_labeled_trees_with_valency_three","221313514_Parsimonious_Reconstruction_of_Sequence_Evolution_and_Haplotype_Blocks","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","21020535_Hein_J_Reconstructing_Evolution_of_Sequences_Subject_to_Recombination_Using_Parsimony_Mathematical_Biosciences_98_185-200","18532798_An_iterative_approach_from_the_standpoint_of_the_additive_hypothesis_to_the_dendrogram_problem_posed_by_molecular_data_sets","14262174_On_the_Nearest_Neighbour_Interchange_Distance_Between_Evolutionary_Trees"]}
