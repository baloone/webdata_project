{"id":"303740136_A_Bigraphical_Model_for_Specifying_Cloud-Based_Elastic_Systems_and_Their_Behaviour","abstract":"The few recent years have witnessed the appearance of a new kind of self-adaptive systems called cloud based-elastic systems. These systems are particularly appealing for their ability to maintain a decent quality of service and reduce a systemâ€™s operating cost at the same time. They achieve this by dynamically adjusting resources allocation in terms of elasticity. Meanwhile, complexity of structural and behavioural aspects related to cloud-based elastic systems increase the difficulty of designing and developing such systems. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a formal approach based on bigraphical reactive systems for modelling both structural and behavioural aspects of cloud-based elastic systems. In particular, we represent their behaviour in terms of client/application interactions and elasticity methods at different levels using bigraphical reaction rules. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated through a motivating example running on the top of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) infrastructure.Modelling cloud-based elastic systems using bigraphical reactive systems","authors":["Hamza Sahli","Nabil Hameurlain","Faiza Belala"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Parallel Emergent and Distributed Systems 32(6):1-24","DOI:10.1080/17445760.2016.1188927"],"references":["301924344_Elasticity_in_cloud_computing_What_it_is_and_what_it_is_not","283485296_A_BRS-Based_Approach_to_Model_and_Verify_Cloud_Systems_Elasticity","280549160_Experimental_Analysis_on_Autonomic_Strategies_for_Cloud_Elasticity","279449141_Towards_a_bigraphical_encoding_of_Actors","271521500_Managing_and_Monitoring_Elastic_Cloud_Applications","267929028_An_autonomic_approach_to_manage_elasticity_of_business_processes_in_the_Cloud","262452110_Cloud_elasticity_using_probabilistic_model_checking","259891756_Formal_Modeling_and_Evaluation_of_Service-Based_Business_Process_Elasticity_in_the_Cloud","259891669_Time-Based_Evaluation_of_Service-Based_Business_Process_Elasticity_in_the_Cloud","259891480_Formal_Modeling_and_Evaluation_of_Stateful_Service-Based_Business_Process_Elasticity_in_the_Cloud","236174444_An_adaptive_hybrid_elasticity_controller_for_cloud_infrastructures","235783934_Testing_Elastic_Systems_with_Surrogate_Models","235534087_A_Survey_on_Cloud_Computing_Elasticity","224257936_Principles_of_Elastic_Processes","224257089_Scaling_Non-elastic_Applications_Using_Virtual_Machines","222373636_Bigraphs_and_Their_Algebra","321611008_Automata_Languages_and_Programming_32nd_International_Colloquium_ICALP_2005_Lisbon_Portugal_July_11-15_2005_Proceedings","321575021_Distributed_Applications_and_Interoperable_Systems_14th_IFIP_WG_61_International_Conference_DAIS_2014_Held_as_Part_of_the_9th_International_Federated_Conference_on_Distributed_Computing_Techniques_Dis","299669867_Formal_Definition_of_Service_Availability_in_Cloud_Computing_Using_OWL","286724305_Modeling_and_analysis_BPEL-based_web_services_composition_using_XYZ","277404642_A_Formal_Framework_for_Cloud_Systems","271589473_The_NIST_definition_of_cloud_computing","269304801_Modeling_and_Analysis_of_Mobile_Cloud_Computing_Based_on_Bigraph_Theory","269300659_Improving_reliability_in_management_of_cloud_computing_infrastructure_by_formal_methods","261071174_Formalising_Workflows_Partitioning_over_Federated_Clouds_Multi-level_Security_and_Costs","259105127_Multi-level_Elasticity_Control_of_Cloud_Services","241636173_Formalizing_the_Structure_and_Behaviour_of_Context-Aware_Systems_in_Bigraphs","220689276_The_Space_and_Motion_of_Communicating_Agents"]}
