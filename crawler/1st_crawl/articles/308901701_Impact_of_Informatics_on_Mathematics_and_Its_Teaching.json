{"id":"308901701_Impact_of_Informatics_on_Mathematics_and_Its_Teaching","abstract":"In this article, we come back to the seminal role of epistemology in didactics of sciences and particularly in mathematics. We defend that the epistemological research on the interactions between mathematics and informatics is necessary to feed didactical research on todayâ€™s mathematics learning and teaching situations, impacted by the development of informatics. We develop some examples to support this idea and propose some perspectives to attack this issue.","authors":["Simon Modeste"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-47286-7_17","Conference: International Conference on History and Philosophy of Computing"],"references":["251510381_Exploratory_Experimentation_Digitally-Assisted_Discovery_and_Proof","225442264_ICMI_Study_19_Proof_and_proving_in_mathematics_education","333530931_Epistemologie_et_didactique","321621645_A_History_of_Algorithms_From_the_Pebble_to_the_Microchip","300478848_The_Proof_Is_in_the_Process_A_Preamble_for_a_Philosophy_of_Computer-Assisted_Mathematics","278630051_Some_Reflections_on_Mathematics_and_Its_Relation_to_Computer_Science","275808567_Impact_of_Computers","266713326_What_is_an_Answer","266685988_Algorithmic_Thinking_and_Mathematical_Thinking","265573609_Trends_in_Mathematics_How_they_could_Change_Education","238447272_Mathematics_An_Experimental_Science","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
