{"id":"242932621_A_Transform-Free_Approximation_for_the_Finite_Capacity_MGs_Queue","abstract":"This paper develops a transform-free approximation for the steady-state queue-length distribution in an M/G/s queue with finite waiting spaces. The approximation is obtained by using a conservation law and some heuristics. It is shown that the approximation is exact for the cases with either no extra waiting space, exponential service-time distribution, or a certain two-parameter family of service-time distributions. It is also shown that the approximation has the same light-traffic properties as the known light-traffic limit theorem for the infinite capacity case when the number of waiting spaces is not less than one.","authors":["Toshikazu Kimura"],"meta":["December 1996Operations Research 44(6):984-988","DOI:10.1287/opre.44.6.984"],"references":["297110702_HEAVY_TRAFFIC_THEORY_FOR_QUEUES_WITH_SEVERAL_SERVERS_2","254890957_Computational_Methods_for_Single-Server_and_Multi-Server_Queues_with_Markovian_Input_and_General_Service_Times","245279588_Refining_Cosmetatos'_Approximation_for_the_Mean_Waiting_Time_in_the_MDs_Queue","242929764_A_Light-Traffic_Theorem_for_Multi-Server_Queues","226280707_Maximum_entropy_two-station_cyclic_queues_with_multiple_general_servers","222453267_Comparison_conjectures_about_the_MGs_queue","31954259_Approximating_the_Mean_Waiting_Time_in_the_GIGs_Queue"]}
