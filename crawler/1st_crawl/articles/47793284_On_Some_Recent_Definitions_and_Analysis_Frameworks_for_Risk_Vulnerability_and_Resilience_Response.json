{"id":"47793284_On_Some_Recent_Definitions_and_Analysis_Frameworks_for_Risk_Vulnerability_and_Resilience_Response","abstract":"Recently, considerable attention has been paid to a systems-based approach to risk, vulnerability, and resilience analysis. It is argued that risk, vulnerability, and resilience are inherently and fundamentally functions of the states of the system and its environment. Vulnerability is defined as the manifestation of the inherent states of the system that can be subjected to a natural hazard or be exploited to adversely affect that system, whereas resilience is defined as the ability of the system to withstand a major disruption within acceptable degradation parameters and to recover within an acceptable time, and composite costs, and risks. Risk, on the other hand, is probability based, defined by the probability and severity of adverse effects (i.e., the consequences). In this article, we look more closely into this approach. It is observed that the key concepts are inconsistent in the sense that the uncertainty (probability) dimension is included for the risk definition but not for vulnerability and resilience. In the article, we question the rationale for this inconsistency. The suggested approach is compared with an alternative framework that provides a logically defined structure for risk, vulnerability, and resilience, where all three concepts are incorporating the uncertainty (probability) dimension.","authors":["Terje Aven"],"meta":["November 2010Risk Analysis 31(4):515-22","DOI:10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01528.x","SourcePubMed"],"references":["251615094_A_risk_perspective_suitable_for_resilience_engineering","8034346_Vulnerability_and_protection_of_infrastructure_networks","347495694_Risk_Analysis_in_Engineering_and_Economics","321602462_Critical_Infrastructures_at_Risk_Securing_the_European_Electric_Power_System","321524588_Risk_Management_and_Governance","279187565_Risk_Governance_Coping_With_Uncertainty_in_a_Complex_World","267079244_Reliability_and_Risk_A_Bayesian_Perspective","266231527_Risk_Analysis_Assessing_Uncertainties_Beyond_Expected_Values_and_Probabilities","251615350_The_ontological_status_of_the_concept_of_risk","248992436_On_risk_defined_as_an_event_where_the_outcome_is_uncertain","245224357_Advances_in_Safety-Critial_Systems","245079323_A_decision_framework_for_risk_management_with_application_to_the_offshore_oil_and_gas_industry","245079159_On_how_to_define_understand_and_describe_risk","235957948_Of_Acceptable_Risk_Science_and_The_Determination_of_Safety","229470102_The_Words_of_Risk_Analysis","227669218_The_Philosophy_of_Statistics","223819660_Some_Consideration_on_the_Treatment_of_Uncertainties_in_Risk_Assessment_for_Practical_Decision_Making","223019592_Aven_T_A_unified_framework_for_risk_and_vulnerability_analysis_covering_both_safety_and_security_Reliability_Engineering_and_System_Safety_926_745-754","222905681_Identification_of_safety_and_security_critical_systems_and_activities","50249005_Responses_to_Terje_Aven's_Paper_On_Some_Recent_Definitions_and_Analysis_Frameworks_for_Risk_Vulnerability_and_Resilience","40141753_Risk_analysis_and_economics","40041139_On_the_Complex_Definition_of_Risk_A_Systems-Based_Approach","24247494_On_the_Definition_of_Resilient_Systems","23788169_The_Role_of_Quantitative_Risk_Assessments_for_Characterizing_Risk_and_Uncertainty_and_Delineating_Appropriate_Risk_Management_Options_with_Special_Emphasis_on_Terrorism_Risk","1939321_The_Revenge_of_Distance_Vulnerability_Analysis_of_Critical_Information_Infrastructure"]}
