{"id":"301063383_PROBLEM_SOLVING_AND_INFERENCE_MECHANISMS","abstract":"The heart of the fifth generation computer in prospect is powerful mechanisms for problem solving and inference. A deduction-oriented language is planned to be designed, which, with its processor, will form the core of the whole computing system. The language is based on predicate logic with the extended features of structuring facilities, meta structures and relational data base interfaces. Parallel computation mechanisms and specialized hardware architectures are extensively investigated to make possible efficient realization of the language features. The project includes an intelligent programming system, a knowledge representation language and system, and a meta inference system to be built on the core.","authors":["Koichi Furukawa","Reiji NAKAJIMA","Akinori Yonezawa","Shigeki Goto"],"meta":["December 1982","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-444-86440-6.50008-6","In book: Fifth Generation Computer Systems (pp.131-138)"],"references":["220197239_Hierarchical_Program_Specification_and_Verification_-_a_Many-sorted_Logical_Approach"]}
