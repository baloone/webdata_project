{"id":"335950765_The_Crumble_Integrating_Computer_Science_through_Engineering_Design","abstract":"Within the past few years there has been an increasing emphasis on making computer science (CS) more accessible for all K-12 students. In 2013 there were 12 states that\nallowed CS courses to count towards high school graduation, and in 2018 that number had grown to 35 states plus the District of Columbia (Code.org, 2018). Specifically, in the\nstate of Maryland, CS courses can be used to satisfy the technology and engineering (T&E) education graduation requirement despite limited alignment with state regulations\npertaining to T&E education course content (Buckler, Koperski, & Loveland, 2017; Love & Strimel, 2017; Love, Tomlinson, & Dunn, 2016). Due to the increasing demand for CS in schools and computer-based programming courses being substituted for hands-on T&E education classes, the authors developed a design challenge to demonstrate how\nCS concepts could be taught while maintaining a focus on engineering design and technological systems.","authors":["Tyler S.
