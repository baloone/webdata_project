{"id":"324253557_Socially-Aware_Secrecy-Ensured_Resource_Allocation_in_D2D_Underlay_Communication_An_Overlapping_Coalitional_Game_Scheme","abstract":"With the popularity of proximity-based services, device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks is a promising technology to cope with the growing demands by improving network resource utilization. However, wireless communication’s broadcast nature is vulnerable to eavesdropping, thus, ensuring secrecy communication for both cellular user equipments (CUEs) and D2D pairs in an underlay network is a challenging issue. We investigate the problem of physical-layer secure transmission jointly with resource allocation in D2D communications. Different from existing works, we framed overlapping (partial) coalitional game where each D2D pair can access multiple CUEs’ spectral resources. Moreover, multiple D2D pairs can share single CUE subchannel in multiple eavesdroppers scenario to ensure information security for both CUEs and D2D pairs, and to maximize system sum-rate in socially-aware D2D network. We incorporate mutual interference and propose different transmission modes for secrecy ensured resource allocation based overlapping coalition formation scheme with transferable utility to obtain a final stable partition. We further prove the proposed algorithm stability, convergence and computational complexity. Both analytical and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, which ensures system-wide security and at the same time improves the performance by maximizing the system sum-rate.
