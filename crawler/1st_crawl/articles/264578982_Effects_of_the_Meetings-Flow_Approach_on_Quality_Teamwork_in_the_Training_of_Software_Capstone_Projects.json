{"id":"264578982_Effects_of_the_Meetings-Flow_Approach_on_Quality_Teamwork_in_the_Training_of_Software_Capstone_Projects","abstract":"Software development relies heavily on teamwork; determining how to streamline this collaborative development is an essential training subject in computer and software engineering education. A team process known as the meetings-flow (MF) approach has recently been introduced in software capstone projects in engineering programs at various institutions. In undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricula that emphasize team- and project-based learning, the MF approach serves as a macro-level instructional tool to guide students in holistically designing and directing collaborative project development. Previous studies on MF have shown the technical benefits of monitoring student work and product quality. This study investigated the approach further, from the perspective of team management. The effects of MF were examined through an experiment with team-related hypotheses. The results revealed that MF significantly enhances a team's communication and coordination and balances members' contributions by giving mutual support and effort. It has relatively less influence, however, on student team cohesion.","authors":["Chung-Yang Chen","Ya-Chun Hong","Pei-Chi Chen"],"meta":["August 2014IEEE Transactions on Education 57(3):201-208","DOI:10.1109/TE.2014.2305918"],"references":["266024162_Limitations_of_Agile_Software_Processes","264467167_Pedagogies_of_Engagement_Classroom-Based_Practices","258138220_The_Impact_of_Peer_Mentoring_on_Organizational_Knowledge_Creation_and_Sharing_An_Empirical_Study_in_a_Software_Firm","247824250_Interteam_Coordination_Project_Commitment_and_Teamwork_in_Multiteam_RD_Projects_A_Longitudinal_Study","228365985_Teamwork_Quality_and_the_Success_of_Innovative_Projects_A_Theoretical_Concept_and_Empirical_Evidence","224236694_A_Capstone_Course_on_Agile_Software_Development_Using_Scrum","222646080_Learning_teamwork_skills_in_university_programming_courses","220591780_Team_Cognition_Development_and_Evolution_in_Software_Project_Teams","220591122_Relating_Collaborative_Technology_Use_to_Teamwork_Quality_and_Performance_An_Empirical_Analysis","220420154_Practical_intelligence_in_IT_assessing_soft_skills_of_IT_professionals","220017741_Effects_Of_Small-Group_Learning_On_Undergraduates_In_Science_Mathematics_Engineering_And_Technology_A_Meta-Analysis","220017716_Inductive_Teaching_and_Learning_Methods_Definitions_Comparisons_and_Research_Bases","215566206_Necessary_and_Neglected_An_Empirical_Study_of_Internal_Documentation_in_Agile_Software_Development_Teams","43410168_An_Exploratory_Study_on_Issues_and_Challenges_of_Agile_Software_Development_with_Scrum","37150329_Knowledge_Gathering_Team_Capabilities_and_Project_Performance_in_Challenging_Work_Environments","3247627_The_Scrum_Software_Development_Process_for_Small_Teams","3188333_Mockus_A_An_empirical_study_of_speed_and_communication_in_globally_distributed_software_development_IEEE_Transactions_on_Software_Engineering_299_481-494","3076787_Why_software_projects_escalate_The_importance_of_project_management_constructs","3052882_Experience_Management_Wikis_for_Reflective_Practice_in_Software_Capstone_Projects","303194482_Peer-led_team_learning_A_prospective_method_for_increasing_critical_thinking_in_undergraduate_science_courses","284409013_Intellectual_teamwork_Social_and_technological_foundations_of_cooperative_work","277473765_Practical_intelligence_in_IT","271418279_The_software_engineering_capstone","270363836_Multivariate_Analysis_of_Variance","262260619_Using_Mulivariate_Statistics","258238966_Integrated_Engineering_Curricula","248656667_Agile_project_management_with_SCRUM","248344804_Knowledge_Integration_at_the_Edge_of_Technology_On_Teamwork_and_Complexity_in_New_Turbine_Development","245473099_Software_development_for_cim_-_a_case_study","240696809_The_Importance_and_Invasiveness_of_Student_Team_Selection_Criteria","238162434_A_Review_of_Literature_on_Teaching_Design_Through_Project-Oriented_Capstone_Courses","236612624_A_knowledge-intensive_design_for_team_composition_in_human-centered_teamwork-based_projects","236612618_The_Design_and_Development_of_a_Computerized_Tool_Support_for_Conducting_Senior_Projects_in_Software_Engineering_Education","236612606_Software_Engineering_Education_A_Study_on_Conducting_Collaborative_Senior_Project_Development","236612579_Managing_projects_from_a_client_perspective_The_concept_of_the_meetings-flow_approach","236612575_The_coordination_processes_and_dynamics_within_the_inter-organizational_context_of_contract-based_outsourced_engineering_projects","234781084_A_meetings_flow_approach_for_conducting_student_final-year_projects","232564616_Time_matters_in_groups","232464304_The_Relation_Between_Group_Cohesiveness_and_Performance_An_Integration","227805935_Relations_Between_Work_Group_Characteristics_and_Effectiveness_Implications_for_Designing_Effective_Work_Groups","225954065_Strengthening_Capstone_Skills_in_STEM_Programs","224146533_Teaching_Agile_Software_Development_A_Case_Study","223853757_Types_of_collaborative_work_in_software_engineering","221537464_The_software_engineering_capstone_Structure_and_tradeoffs","220214954_Project_teaming_Knowledge-intensive_design_for_composing_team_members","220017541_White_Paper_on_Promising_Practices_in_Undergraduate_STEM_Education","50336282_A_Primer_of_Multivariate_Statistics","31743386_Project_Management_A_Systems_Approach_to_Planning_Scheduling_and_Controlling_H_Kerzner","4251347_Good_Practices_for_Educational_Software_Engineering_Projects","3247888_Teaching_Teamwork","3050857_Electrical_and_computer_engineering_curriculum_assessment_via_senior_miniproject"]}
