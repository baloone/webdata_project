{"id":"335368828_Computer_architecture","abstract":"The book is intended as a text to support two semesters of courses in computer architecture at the college senior and graduate levels. There are excellent problems for students at the end of each chapter. The authors have divided the use of computers into the following four levels of sophistication: data processing, information processing, knowledge processing, and intelligence processing. Computer and digital system architecture Theoretical and practical aspects of computer-architecture design are examined in an introductory text for senior and graduate students in computer science and engineering. Chapters are devoted to design methods and descriptive tools, system structure, the memory hierarchy, the instruction-set processor, processor implementation and control, input/output and other processors, parallel computer systems, special-purpose computing systems, and future trends. Diagrams, graphs, and sample problems for each chapter are included.","authors":["Hala Jawad"],"meta":["August 2019","Project: Fire and Gas Protection System Using Internet OF Things(IOT)"],"references":[]}
