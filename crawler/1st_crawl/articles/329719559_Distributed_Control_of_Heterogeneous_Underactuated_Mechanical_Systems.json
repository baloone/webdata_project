{"id":"329719559_Distributed_Control_of_Heterogeneous_Underactuated_Mechanical_Systems","abstract":"We show how passivity-based control by interconnection and damping assignment (IDA-PBC) can be used as a design procedure to derive distributed control laws for undirected connected networks of underactuated and fully-actuated heterogeneous mechanical systems. With or without leaders, agents are able to reach a stationary formation in the coordinate of interest, even if each agent has different dynamics, provided that each agent satisfies three matching conditions for cooperation. If these are satisfied, we show how existing single-system IDA-PBC solutions can be used to construct distributed control laws, thereby enabling distributed control design for a large class of applications. The procedure is illustrated for a network of flexible-joint robots and a network of heterogeneous inverted pendulum-cart systems.","authors":["Laurens Valk","Tam√°s Keviczky"],"meta":["January 2018IFAC-PapersOnLine 51(23):325-330","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.12.056"],"references":[]}
