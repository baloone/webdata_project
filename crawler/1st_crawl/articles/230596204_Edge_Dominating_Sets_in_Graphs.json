{"id":"230596204_Edge_Dominating_Sets_in_Graphs","abstract":"We prove that the edge dominating set problem for graphs is $NP$-complete even when restricted to planar or bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3. We show as a corollary that the minimum maximal matching and the achromatic number problems are $NP$-complete. A new linear time algorithm for finding minimum independent edge dominating sets in trees is described, based on an observed relationship between edge dominating sets and independent sets in total graphs.","authors":["Mihalis Yannakakis","Fanica Gavril"],"meta":["June 1980SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 38(3):364-372","DOI:10.1137/0138030"],"references":["246012399_Edge_domination_in_trees","265354638_The_total_chromatic_number_of_a_graph_A_survey","244969155_A_Note_on_the_Complexity_of_the_Superstring_Problem","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","243531499_Introduction_to_combinatorial_mathematics","242910238_A_recognition_algorithm_for_the_total_graphs","238800817_Smallest_Maximal_Matchings_in_the_Graph_of_the_d-Dimensional_Cube","225125495_On_rigid_circuit_graphs","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","221590143_Algorithms_for_Edge_Coloring_Bipartite_Graphs"]}
