{"id":"220365307_Coverage_analysis_of_Scopus_A_journal_metric_approach","abstract":"Our aim is to compare the coverage of the Scopus database with that of Ulrich, to determine just how homogenous it is in the academic world. The variables taken into account were subject distribution, geographical distribution, distribution by publishers and the language of publication. The analysis of the coverage of a product of this nature should be done in relation to an accepted model, the optimal choice being Ulrich’s Directory, considered the international point of reference for the most comprehensive information on journals published throughout the world. The results described here allow us to draw a profile of Scopus in terms of its coverage by areas – geographic and thematic – and the significance of peer-review in its publications. Both these aspects are\nhighly pragmatic considerations for information retrieval, the evaluation of research, and the design of policies for the use of scientific databases in scientific promotion.","authors":["Felix de Moya-Anegon","Zaida Chinchilla-Rodríguez","Benjamín Vargas-Quesada","Elena Corera-Álvarez"],"meta":["October 2007Scientometrics 73(1):53-78","DOI:10.1007/s11192-007-1681-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["263152789_Web_of_Science_2004_version_and_Scopus","234144770_As_we_may_search-Comparison_of_major_features_of_the_Web_of_Science_Scopus_and_Google_Scholar_citation-based_and_citation-enhanced_databases","228732893_Welcome_to_the_linguistic_warp_zone_Benchmarking_scientific_output_in_the_social_sciences_and_humanities","28157718_Scopus_El_mayor_navegador_cientifico_de_la_web","299202232_How_balanced_is_the_Science_Citation_Index's_journal_coverage_-_A_preliminary_overview_of_macrolevel_statistical_data"]}
