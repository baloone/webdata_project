{"id":"248422666_What_is_the_Demographic_Dividend","abstract":"The dividend period is a window of opportunity. The dividends are sequential: the first dividend begins first and comes to an end, and the second dividend begins somewhat later and continues indefinitely. The two dividends overlap and their sizes depend on how much people produce and consume at each age. Thus, if workers are encouraged to save and accumulate pension funds, population aging can boost capital per worker, productivity growth and per capita income. In view of this, the duty of policymakers is to focus on establishing financial systems that are sound, trusted and accessible to the millions who wish to secure their financial futures.","authors":["R.D.
