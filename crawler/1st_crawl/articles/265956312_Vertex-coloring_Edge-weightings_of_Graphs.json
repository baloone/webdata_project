{"id":"265956312_Vertex-coloring_Edge-weightings_of_Graphs","abstract":"A k-edge-weighting of a graph G is a mapping w : E(G) -> {1, 2, ... , k}. An edge-weighting w induces a vertex coloring f(w) : V(G) -> N defined by f(w)(v) = Sigma(v is an element of e)w(e). An edge-weighting w is vertex-coloring if f(w)(u) not equal f(w)(v) for any edge uv. The current paper studies the parameter mu(G), which is the minimum k for which G has a vertex-coloring k-edge-weighting. Exact values of mu(G) are determined for several classes of graphs, including trees and r-regular bipartite graph with r >= 3.","authors":["Gerard Jennhwa Chang","Changhong Lu","Jiaojiao Wu","Qinglin Yu"],"meta":["August 2011Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics 15(4)","DOI:10.11650/twjm/1500406380"],"references":["220075635_Vertex-coloring_edge-weightings_Towards_the_1-2-3-conjecture","278543742_Vertex-distinguishing_edge_colorings_of_graphs","246543947_Irregular_assignments_and_vertex-distinguishing_edge-colorings_of_graphs","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","231945578_The_Harmonious_Chromatic_Number_of_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","228526618_On_graph_irregularity_strength","226963348_On_vertex-coloring_13-edge-weighting","220441404_Vertex-Colouring_Edge-Weightings","220074779_Vertex_coloring_edge_partitions"]}
