{"id":"267092758_Extending_belief_base_change_to_logic_programs_with_ASP","abstract":"This chapter shows how ASP can be used as a unified formalism for both representing and implementing change operations for logic programs. In order to illustrate these two aspects, we present a framework, ΠRSF, which extends to logic programs the removed sets framework, proposed for revising and merging propositional belief bases, properties of ΠRSF operators are studied and an implementation of these operators is provided that can be performed with any ASP solver.","authors":["Julien Hué","Odile Papini","Éric Würbel"],"meta":["December 2013"],"references":[]}
