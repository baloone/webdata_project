{"id":"304055042_Adoption_of_Bring_Your_Own_Device_in_HE_FE_Institutions","abstract":"Extant literature of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) adoption in educational institutions examines the benefits from a student perspective and how effectively it can be used to support learning activities. It is also acknowledged that it is more widely used for scholastic administrative tasks and research purposes than it is for teaching. Thus, there is little academic literature that addresses the use of BYOD in education from a staff user perspective. Using two case studies this research investigates the use and practice of BYOD within Higher Education (HE)and Further Education (FE) institutions. We identify which technological devices are preferred, the activities they perform and establish the perceived advantages and disadvantages of academic staff using BYOD as part of their teaching and scholastic activities.","authors":["Hilary Berger","James Symonds"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2925995.2926027","Conference: the The 11th International Knowledge Management in Organizations Conference"],"references":["321505356_What_is_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_TPACK","317953623_Teacher_pedagogical_beliefs_The_final_frontier_in_our_quest_for_technology_integration","298205176_Cross-Surface_Challenges_and_Opportunities_for_'bring_your_own_device'_in_the_wild","284769158_Adopting_Mobile_Learning_in_Tertiary_Environments_Instructional_Curricular_and_Organizational_Matters","272007146_Teacher_Technology_Change_How_Knowledge_Beliefs_and_Culture_Intersect","242385653_Introducing_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge","241616400_What_Is_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge","237335805_The_Pedagogy_of_Technology_Integration","220202857_Beyond_Classroom_The_Uses_of_Mobile_Phones_by_Female_Students","317953655_Designing_and_conducting_mixed_methods_research","308310369_Discrimination_factors_in_faculty_use_of_instructional_technology_in_higher_education","298573718_Examining_teacher_technology_use_Implications_for_preservice_and_Inservice_teacher_preparation_vol_54_pg_297_2003","287237670_Employees'_compliance_with_BYOD_security_policy_Insights_from_reactance_organizational_justice_and_protection_motivation_theory","285886015_The_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_Framework","285739465_Qualitative_Methods_for_Health_Research","285088568_Connecting_the_dots_to_the_future_of_technology_in_higher_education","283235544_Academics_adopting_mobile_devices_The_zone_of_free_movement","273765089_Exploring_Students'_Mobile_Learning_Practices_in_Higher_Education","263536480_Blending_student_technology_experiences_in_formal_and_informal_learning","255566917_Teacher_Adoption_of_Technology_A_Perceptual_Control_Theory_Perspective","249121140_Commonalities_and_Distinctive_Patterns_in_Teachers'_Integration_of_Computers","240218229_Research_Methods_for_Business_Students","230853197_Diffusion_of_Innovations_Fifth_Edition","222688486_Computer_supported_collaborative_learning_using_wirelessly_interconnected_mobile_computers","220374236_Anytime_Anywhere_Learning_Supported_by_Smart_Phones_Experiences_and_Results_from_the_MUSIS_Project"]}
