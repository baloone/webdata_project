{"id":"323317345_Modeling_Students'_Dropout_in_Mexican_Universities","abstract":"Nowadays, the student dropout rate in Mexican higher education institutions have increased, affecting diverse life aspects such as economic, social, academic, and among others. The students dropout prediction is a challenge because of numerous interacting factors; an accurate prediction is useful for universities to implement strategies that reduce student failure-e.g., to implement tutorial action plans. The present research work proposes a model to predict dropout based on the student self-reported information and scores on the university entrance exam. A case of study to evaluate the proposed model was performed, results show a precision of about 86%. This model can serve to support decisions on strategies to reduce students' failure.","authors":["Noel Enrique Rodríguez-Maya","Carlos Lara-Alvarez","Oscar May Tzuc","Brian Alison Suárez-Carranza"],"meta":["December 2017Research in Computing Science 139(139)","DOI:10.13053/rcs-139-1-13","Projects: HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING & ROBOTICS LABModelo para la Predicción de Deserción Escolar de los Estudiantes del Instituto Tecnológico de Zitácuaro"],"references":["339596766_PREDICTING_STUDENTS'_PERFORMANCES_USING_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS","267296594_Mining_Educational_Data_to_Reduce_Dropout_Rates_of_Engineering_Students","261488766_Prediction_of_school_dropout_risk_group_using_Neural_Network","221570467_Predicting_Students_Drop_Out_A_Case_Study","221570432_Predicting_School_Failure_Using_Data_Mining","308828791_Identifying_factors_that_influence_student_failure_rate_using_Exhaustive_CHAID_Chi-square_automatic_interaction_detection","303517387_The_CRISP-DM_model_the_new_blueprint_for_data_mining","301407145_Using_cluster_ensemble_to_improve_classification_of_student_dropout_in_Thai_university","286479538_Student_Dropout_Predictive_Model_Using_Data_Mining_Techniques","262566601_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques_Third_Edition"]}
