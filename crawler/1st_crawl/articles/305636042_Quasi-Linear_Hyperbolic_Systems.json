{"id":"305636042_Quasi-Linear_Hyperbolic_Systems","abstract":"In this chapter, we continue to explore the use of Lyapunov functions for the stability analysis of quasi-linear hyperbolic systems under dissipative boundary conditions. We address the most general case of systems that cannot be transformed into Riemann coordinates.","authors":["Georges Bastin","Jean-Michel Coron"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-32062-5_6","In book: Stability and Boundary Stabilization of 1-D Hyperbolic Systems (pp.203-218)"],"references":["287250018_Dissipative_boundary_conditions_for_2times_2_hyperbolic_systems_of_conservation_laws_for_entropy_solutions_in_BV","257432153_ISS-Lyapunov_functions_for_time-varying_hyperbolic_systems_of_balance_laws","224309409_Boundary_Control_of_Open_Channels_With_Numerical_and_Experimental_Validations","220387160_Lyapunov-Based_Boundary_Control_for_A_Class_of_Hyperbolic_Lotka-Volterra_Systems","220210292_Robust_boundary_control_of_systems_of_conservation_laws","3333027_Extremum_Seeking_Control_of_Cascaded_Raman_Optical_Amplifiers"]}
