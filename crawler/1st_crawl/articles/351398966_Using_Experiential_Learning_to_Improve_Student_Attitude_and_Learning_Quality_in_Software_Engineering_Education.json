{"id":"351398966_Using_Experiential_Learning_to_Improve_Student_Attitude_and_Learning_Quality_in_Software_Engineering_Education","abstract":"Experiential learning (EL) has great potential to transform studentsâ€™ learning experience. Few studies, however, have focused on the use of EL in computer science education. The purpose of this study was to examine students' experiences with EL in computer science. Data were collected to examine the influence of EL on students' attitudes and quality of learning. The antecedent variables included student involvement, learning expectancy, instructor impact, course structure, and prior experience. PLS-SEM with PLSc was used to test generated hypotheses. The findings indicated that student involvement positively correlated with attitudes and learning expectancy. Instructor impact is positively associated with student involvement, quality of learning, and attitudes. Prior experience positively correlated with learning expectancy. Finally, course structure positively moderated the relationship between student involvement and learning expectancy. It is concluded that EL is a promising pedagogy to improve student attitudes and quality of learning in software engineering education.","authors":["Ferdinand Che","Kenneth David Strang","Narasimha Rao Vajjhala"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.4018/IJITLHE.20210101.oa2"],"references":["333187169_How_to_perform_and_report_an_impactful_analysis_using_partial_least_squares_Guidelines_for_confirmatory_and_explanatory_IS_research","331660283_Closing_the_Gap_Between_Software_Engineering_Education_and_Industrial_Needs","330926844_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_CFA_Exploratory_Structural_Equation_Modeling_ESEM_Set-ESEM_Optimal_Balance_between_Goodness_of_Fit_and_Parsimony","330393413_Evaluating_students_readiness_expectancy_acceptance_and_effectiveness_of_augmented_reality_based_construction_technology_education","327702133_Effect_of_Performance_Expectancy_and_Effort_Expectancy_on_the_Mobile_Commerce_Adoption_Intention_through_Personal_Innovativeness_among_Pakistani_Consumers","327527752_New_Methods_for_Collaborative_Experiential_Learning_to_Provide_Personalised_Formative_Assessment","336142145_Woods_A_D_Price_T_Crosby_G_2019_The_Impact_of_the_Student-Athlete's_Engagement_Strategies_on_Learning_Development_and_Retention_A_Literary_Study_College_Student_Journal_533_285-292","325725527_Dimensions_of_experientialism_for_software_engineering_education","325566011_RMSEA_CFI_and_TLI_in_structural_equation_modeling_with_ordered_categorical_data_The_story_they_tell_depends_on_the_estimation_methods","323615458_What_Is_Student_Engagement"]}
