{"id":"320142224_The_effects_of_the_computational_thinking-based_programming_class_on_the_computer_learning_attitude_of_non-major_students_in_the_teacher_training_college","abstract":"In these days, the software-integrated education is considered very important in both K-12 and undergraduate education. However, negative attitudes about software learning, such as lack of confidence caused by insufficient educational opportunities about computational thinking-based programming experience, could be a barrier to try software-integrated education for the non-majors in college. Unfortunately, only ICT skill-based education is provided for undergraduate students of the teacher training college in Korea, and we cannot find courses on computational thinking-based programming education in the university curriculum of liberal arts. Thus in this study, we developed a computational thinking-based programming course applicable to the liberal arts of the non-major education. Then we performed our experiment to both a controlled group with the traditional ICT skill-based course and an experimental group with our computational thinking-based programming course, and the paired samples t-tests were carried out. As a statistical result, the mean score of the experimental group is significantly higher on the most area of computer learning attitude. Thus, we concluded that the computational thinking-based programming class is more significant to foster affective elements of computer learning attitude such as superiority, self-confidence, interest, sense of purpose, accomplishment motivation and knowledge application than those of the traditional ICT skill-based class.","authors":["Y.
