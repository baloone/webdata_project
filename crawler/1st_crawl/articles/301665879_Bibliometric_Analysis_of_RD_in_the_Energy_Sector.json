{"id":"301665879_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_RD_in_the_Energy_Sector","abstract":"A bibliometric analysis to evaluate global scientific production on R&D in the Energy sector between 1956 and 2014 was carried out and is based on Journal Citation Reports (JCR) published by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). Data were based on the Web of Science (Science Citation Index) database compiled by Thomson Reuters. In total, 229 articles were analyzed. The results showed that 28 countries independently published 166 articles while international cooperation between countries produced 17 articles. The United States, Japan and India are the three countries that published most articles on the subject. The Energy & Fuels research area showed the highest growth in the articles analyzed (19.3%) and in the articles from the USA (16.18%) and this has been an increasing target in the last five years and covers 22.45% of the articles published in this period. The USA is the country that has published most on R&D in energy, including both individual production and international collaboration. Analysis of R&D investments in energy, studies on energy technology, environmental aspects and global climate changes are among the main topics covered in the twenty most cited articles.","authors":["Danielly Freitas Almeida Araujo","Ana Paula Cabral Seixas Costa"],"meta":["March 2016IEEE Latin America Transactions 14(3):1221-1226","DOI:10.1109/TLA.2016.7459602"],"references":[]}
