{"id":"311896837_Incremental_cooperative_coevolution_for_large-scale_global_optimization","abstract":"Cooperative coevolution (CC) is an efficient framework for solving large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problems. It uses a decomposition method to divide the LSGO problems into several low-dimensional subcomponents; then, subcomponents are optimized. Since CC algorithms do not consider any imbalance feature, their performance degrades during solving imbalanced LSGO problems. In this paper, we propose an incremental CC (ICC) algorithm in which the algorithm optimizes an integrated subcomponent which subcomponents are dynamically added to it. Therefore, the search space of the optimizer is grown incrementally toward the original problem search space. Various search spaces are built according to three approaches, namely random-based, sensitivity analysis-based, and random sensitivity analysis-based methods; then, ICC explores these search spaces effectively. Random-based selects a subcomponent randomly for adding it to the current search space and the sensitivity analysis-based method uses a sensitivity analysis strategy to select a subcomponent. The random sensitivity analysis-based strategy is a hybrid of the random and sensitivity analysis-based methods. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate that the proposed ICC-based algorithms are effective for solving imbalanced LSGO problems. Finally, the efficiency of these algorithms is benchmarked on the complex imbalanced LSGO problems. Simulation results confirm that ICC obtains a better performance overall.","authors":["Sedigheh Mahdavi","Shahryar Rahnamayan","Mohammad hadi Shiri"],"meta":["March 2018Soft Computing 22(6)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-016-2466-6","Project: Cooperative Co-evolutionary algorithms for solving large-scale optimization problems"],"references":["309527321_A_study_on_the_use_of_non-parametric_tests_for_analyzing_the_evolutionary_algorithms'_behaviour_a_case_study_on_the_CEC'2005_special_session_on_real_parameter_optimization","284178898_A_Competitive_Divide-and-Conquer_Algorithm_for_Unconstrained_Large_Scale_Black-Box_Optimization","279952972_Effective_decomposition_of_large-scale_separable_continuous_functions_for_cooperative_co-evolutionary_algorithms","316637896_Introduction_to_Optimum_Design","313108693_Acooperative_coevolutionary_approach_to_function_optimization","290104707_Scaling_Up_Covariance_Matrix_Adaptation_Evolution_Strategy_Using_Cooperative_Coevolution","287227258_Effective_decomposition_of_large-scale_separable_continuous_functions_for_cooperative_co-evolutionary_algorithms","285701083_Eikos_a_simulation_toolbox_for_sensitivity_analysis","275018504_Cooperative_Co-evolution_with_a_new_decomposition_method_for_large-scale_optimization","274008072_Morris_Factorial_Sampling_Plans_for_Preliminary_Computational_Experiments","261562928_Benchmark_Functions_for_the_CEC'2013_Special_Session_and_Competition_on_Large-Scale_Global_Optimization","272161369_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_a_Computational_Model_of_Cooperative_Coevolution","268750916_Metaheuristics_in_large-scale_global_continues_optimization_A_survey","266653604_When_do_evolutionary_algorithms_optimize_separable_functions_in_parallel","262408964_Using_Hybrid_Dependency_Identification_with_a_Memetic_Algorithm_for_Large_Scale_Optimization_Problems"]}
