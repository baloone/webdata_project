It allows the efficient development of measuring instruments for computer science education. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT consists of four sub processes: B1 determine items, B2 test items, B3 analyze items according to Rasch model, and B4 interpret items by criteria. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT is modeled in IDEF0, a process modeling language that is standardized and widely used. It is implemented in R, an open-source software optimized for statistical calculations and graphics that allows users to interact using the web application framework Shiny. Through coordinated processes, cpm.4.CSE/IRT ensures the quality and comparability of test instruments in competence measurement. Cpm.4.CSE/IRT is demonstrated using an example from the competence area of Modeling.","authors":["Andreas Zendler"],"meta":["January 2019Education and Information Technologies 24(3):1-42","DOI:10.1007/s10639-018-9794-3"],"references":["314039274_Didaktik_der_Informatik","345476700_Grundlagen_kompetenzorientierten_Unterrichtens_Von_den_Bildungsstandards_zum_Schulcurriculum","327541088_Joint_hierarchical_modeling_of_responses_and_response_times","322143802_Designevaluation_and_analysis_of_questionnaires_for_survey_research","321621478_Handbook_of_Modern_Item_Response_Theory","314527009_The_MOTVisual_Language_for_Knowledge-Based_Instructional_Design","311472936_Closing_the_loop_on_test_creation_a_question_assessment_mechanism_for_instructors","311401111_Statistical_Analysis_of_Questionnaires_A_Unified_Approach_Based_on_Stata_and_R","306479430_Einfuhrung_in_die_Test-_und_Fragebogenkonstruktion","292686460_E2ML_A_tool_for_sketching_instructional_designs","285356210_Theorien_und_Methoden_der_Skalierung","290985161_Process-Based_Development_of_Competence_Models_to_Computer_Science_Education","290346396_Exact_person_fit_indexes_for_the_Rasch_model_for_arbitrary_alternatives","289867057_Some_Background_for_Item_Response_Theory_and_the_Rasch_Model","288926837_coUML_A_Visual_Language_for_Modeling_Cooperative_Environments"]}
