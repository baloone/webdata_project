{"id":"326539683_Concepts_Before_Coding_Instructional_Support_for_Introductory_Programming_Concepts_in_Middle_School_Computer_Science","abstract":"In this paper, we present research on how important features in a curricular activity system can support middle school studentsâ€™ engagement with and learning of key computer science (CS) concepts. We developed a curriculum with a sequence of non- programming activities intended to support student learning of CS concepts before they start learning programming using block-based approaches.","authors":["Patrik Lundh","Shuchi Grover","Nicholas Jackiw"],"meta":["April 2018","Conference: American Educational Research AssociationAt: New York, NY","Project: Introductory Programming"],"references":["326539412_Combining_Non-Programming_Activities_with_Programming_for_Introducing_Foundational_Computing_Concepts","276852167_Designing_for_deeper_learning_in_a_blended_computer_science_course_for_middle_school_students","247522467_Constructivist_emergent_and_sociocultural_perspectives_in_the_context_of_developmental_research","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation"]}
