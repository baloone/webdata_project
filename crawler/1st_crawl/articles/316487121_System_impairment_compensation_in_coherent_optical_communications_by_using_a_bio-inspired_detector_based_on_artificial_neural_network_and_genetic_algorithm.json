{"id":"316487121_System_impairment_compensation_in_coherent_optical_communications_by_using_a_bio-inspired_detector_based_on_artificial_neural_network_and_genetic_algorithm","abstract":"A bio-inspired detector based on the artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm is proposed in the context of a coherent optical transmission system. The ANN is designed to mitigate 16-quadrature amplitude modulation system impairments, including linear impairment: Gaussian white noise, laser phase noise, in-phase/quadrature component imbalance, and nonlinear impairment: nonlinear phase. Without prior information or heuristic assumptions, the ANN, functioning as a machine learning algorithm, can learn and capture the characteristics of impairments from observed data. Numerical simulations were performed, and dispersion-shifted, dispersion-managed, and dispersion-unmanaged fiber links were investigated. The launch power dynamic range and maximum transmission distance for the bio-inspired method were 2.7 dBm and 240 km greater, respectively, than those of the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm. Moreover, the linewidth tolerance of the bio-inspired technique was 170 kHz greater than that of the k-means method, demonstrating its usability for digital signal processing in coherent systems.","authors":["Danshi Wang","Min Zhang","Ze Li","Chuang Song"],"meta":["September 2017Optics Communications 399:1-12","DOI:10.1016/j.optcom.2017.04.050"],"references":["292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","277411157_Deep_Learning","273769216_Application_of_Machine_Learning_Techniques_for_Amplitude_and_Phase_Noise_Characterization","269699469_Artificial_Neural_Network_Nonlinear_Equalizer_for_Coherent_Optical_OFDM","263767932_Advances_in_high-speed_DACs_ADCs_and_DSP_for_optical_coherent_transceivers","261250027_Visible_Light_Communications_170_Mbs_Using_an_Artificial_Neural_Network_Equalizer_in_a_Low_Bandwidth_White_Light_Configuration","260524066_Reduced_Complexity_Digital_Back-Propagation_Methods_for_Optical_Communication_Systems","224247838_Digital_Postcompensation_Using_Volterra_Series_Transfer_Function","200175550_Optimization_of_the_split-step_Fourier_method_in_modeling_optical-fiber_communication_systems","26282984_Real-time_human_identification_using_a_pyroelectric_infrared_detector_array_and_hidden_Markov_models","5313457_Digital_Filters_for_Coherent_Optical_Receivers","308808146_Nonlinear_decision_boundary_created_by_a_machine_learning-based_classifier_to_mitigate_nonlinear_phase_noise","301579612_Nonlinearity_Mitigation_Using_a_Machine_Learning_Detector_Based_on_k-Nearest_Neighbors","295901968_Combatting_nonlinear_phase_noise_in_coherent_optical_systems_with_an_optimized_decision_processor_based_on_machine_learning","278654343_Interference_Assessment_on_the_Circuit_Domain_in_GSM-R_Networks_by_Grey_Clustering_and_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process","277681710_A_novel_improved_accelerated_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_global_numerical_optimization","260327964_Optical_Label_Routing_Processing_for_BPSK_Labels_Using_Complex-Valued_Neural_Network","258797397_Linewidth-Tolerant_and_Low-Complexity_Two-Stage_Carrier_Phase_Estimation_Based_on_Modified_QPSK_Partitioning_for_Dual-Polarization_16-QAM_Systems","233975968_Nonlinear_impairment_compensation_using_expectation_maximization_for_dispersion_managed_and_unmanaged_PDM_16-QAM_transmission","230743706_Modeling_of_the_Impact_of_Nonlinear_Propagation_Effects_in_Uncompensated_Optical_Coherent_Transmission_Links","227398565_Modulation_format_identification_in_heterogeneous_fiber-optic_networks_using_artificial_neural_networks","224846540_Optical_performance_monitoring_using_the_novel_parametric_asynchronous_eye_diagram","224387215_Adaptively_Combined_FIR_and_Functional_Link_Artificial_Neural_Network_Equalizer_for_Nonlinear_Communication_Channel","224138063_Digital_Coherent_Optical_Receivers_Algorithms_and_Subsystems","224098602_Experimental_25-Gbs_QPSK_WDM_Phase-Modulated_Radio-Over-Fiber_Link_With_Digital_Demodulation_by_a_-Means_Algorithm","222663858_A_Survey_on_Bio-inspired_Networking","221896010_Characterization_of_semiconductor-laser_phase_noise_and_estimation_of_bit-error_rate_performance_with_low-speed_offline_digital_coherent_receivers","26828451_Phase_Noise_in_Photonic_Communications_Systems_Using_Linear_Amplifiers","7381202_Effect_of_dispersion_on_nonlinear_phase_noise_in_optical_transmission_systems","3237673_Effect_of_Fiber_Nonlinearity_on_Long-Distance_Transmission"]}
