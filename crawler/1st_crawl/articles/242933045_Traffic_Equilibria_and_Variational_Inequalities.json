{"id":"242933045_Traffic_Equilibria_and_Variational_Inequalities","abstract":"We consider the general traffic equilibrium network model where the travel cost on each link of the transportation network may depend on the flow on this as well as other links of the network. The model has been designed in order to handle situations where there is interaction between traffic on different links e.g., two-way streets, intersections or between different modes of transportation on the same link. For this model, we use the techniques of the theory of variational inequalities to establish existence of a traffic equilibrium pattern, to design an algorithm for the construction of this pattern and to derive estimates on the speed of convergence of the algorithm.","authors":["Stella Dafermos"],"meta":["February 1980Transportation Science 14(1):42-54","DOI:10.1287/trsc.14.1.42"],"references":["239745330_A_Column_Generation_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Traffic_Assignment","222438374_An_Efficient_Approach_to_Solving_the_Road_Network_Equilibrium_Traffic_Assignment_Problem","274200137_An_Algorithm_for_the_Traffic_Assignment_Problem","245480963_Affectations_de_trafic_et_tarification_au_cout_marginal_social_critique_de_quelques_idees_admises","243783492_The_Traffic_Assignment_Problem_for_Multiclass-User_Transportation_Networks","242932859_An_Extended_Traffic_Assignment_Model_with_Application_to_Two-Way_Traffic","238742750_The_Traffic_Assignment_Problem_for_a_General_Network"]}
