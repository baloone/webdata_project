{"id":"314245956_Anatomy_of_news_consumption_on_Facebook","abstract":"Social media heavily changed the way we get informed and shape our opinions. Users’ polarization seems to dominate news consumption on Facebook. Through a massive analysis on 920 news outlets and 376 million users, we explore the anatomy of news consumption on Facebook on a global scale. We show that users tend to confine their attention on a limited set of pages, thus determining a sharp community structure among news outlets. Furthermore, our findings suggest that users have a more cosmopolitan perspective of the information space than news providers. We conclude with a simple model of selective exposure that well reproduces the observed connectivity patterns.","authors":["Ana Lucía Schmidt","Fabiana Zollo","Michela Del Vicario","Alessandro Bessi"],"meta":["March 2017Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 114(12)","DOI:10.1073/pnas.1617052114"],"references":["323980520_Echo_Chambers_on_Facebook","312153320_Mixing_beliefs_among_interacting_agents","305298758_Reuters_Institute_Digital_News_Report_2015","289263634_The_spreading_of_misinformation_online","281274326_Viral_Misinformation_The_Role_of_Homophily_and_Polarization","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","304878743_Changing_Societies_Changing_Media_Systems_Challenges_for_Communication_Theory_Research_and_Education","304533565_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networksJ","282868394_Debunking_in_a_World_of_Tribes","279547233_The_Law_of_Group_Polarization"]}
