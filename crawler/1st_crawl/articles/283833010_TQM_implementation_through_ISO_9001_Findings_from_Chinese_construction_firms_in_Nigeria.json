{"id":"283833010_TQM_implementation_through_ISO_9001_Findings_from_Chinese_construction_firms_in_Nigeria","abstract":"Purpose\n– The purpose of this paper is to design and test a model integrating the attributes of national culture and total quality management (TQM) principles for successful TQM implementation in international projects involving Chinese construction firms in Nigeria.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– Based on the culture-specific relationship between TQM implementation and national culture and ISO 9001 being a stepping stone to TQM implementation, a model in the form of a matrix was designed integrating Hofstede’s five national cultural dimensions (NCD) and ISO 9001 eight quality management principles. The model was then tested through a three-phase research process including cross-sectional surveys of the Chinese ( n =48) and the Nigerians ( n =80) (Phase 1), Delphi study involving TQM experts ( n =12) (Phase 2), and case studies of Chinese projects in Nigeria ( n =6) (Phase 3).\n\nFindings\n– The model predicts important attributes of national culture and TQM principles for achieving good-quality performance, the management of which leads to a Chinese firm being perceived as delivering good or poor-quality services in Nigeria. Statistical testing using κ statistics revealed significant agreement between two perceived good-quality Chinese firms on the important attributes and significant disagreement between perceived good-quality and poor-quality Chinese firms in Nigeria.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n– The model designed is based on ISO 9001: 2008 version.\n\nPractical implications\n– International businesses in Africa will benefit from this study’s findings.\n\nSocial implications\n– Overseas Chinese firms’ service quality perceptions can be better managed.\n\nOriginality/value\n– This empirical study presents a model for successful TQM implementation through ISO 9001.","authors":["Oluwayomi Babatunde","Low Sui Pheng"],"meta":["October 2015TQM Journal 27(6):671-682","DOI:10.1108/TQM-06-2015-0076"],"references":["282715366_Evaluating_research_methodology_in_construction_productivity_studies","270574108_Examining_the_Implementation_of_ISO_9001_in_Indonesian_Construction_Companies","264090358_Impact_of_ISO_9001_certification_cancellation_on_business_performance_a_case_study_in_Slovenian_organisations","263656925_Why_TQM_programmes_fail_A_pathology_approach","263554808_How_do_interactions_of_Kano_model_attributes_affect_customer_satisfaction_An_analysis_based_on_psychological_foundations","263257907_Fashion_founded_on_a_flaw_The_ecological_mono-deterministic_fallacy_of_Hofstede_GLOBE_and_followers","262831026_Organizational_culture_for_total_quality_management","245283853_Mixed_Method_Research_Fundamental_Issues_of_Design_Validity_and_Reliability_in_Construction_Research","235302978_The_relationships_between_organizational_culture_total_quality_management_practices_and_operational_performance","277197709_The_International_Organization_for_Standardization_ISO_Global_Governance_through_Voluntary_Consensus","276901246_Quality_management_-_History_and_trends","273332869_Assessment_and_cultivation_of_total_quality_management_organisational_culture_-_an_empirical_investigation","271635700_Chinese_construction_firms_in_the_Nigerian_construction_industry","265340902_Standards_as_catalyst_for_national_innovation_and_performance_-_a_capability_assessment_framework_for_latecomer_countries","265217588_ISO_9000_Series_and_Excellence_Models_Fad_to_Fashion_to_Fit","263614797_The_TQM_legacy_-_Gurus'_contributions_and_theoretical_impact","263406212_Effects_of_cultural_assimilation_on_the_performance_of_a_construction_project_-_evidence_from_UAE","263244699_The_effectiveness_of_the_ISO_9001_quality_management_system_in_service_companies","262868051_An_analytical_methodology_for_identifying_the_latent_needs_of_customers","259683187_Introduction_Conflict_in_organizations","259557440_Does_Culture_Impact_Preferred_Employee_Attributes_in_Complaint_Handling_Encounters","255670258_Research_Validation_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_the_Construction_Domain","254349359_TQM_and_organisational_culture_How_do_they_link","254348550_The_first_theorisation_of_quality_Deutscher_Werkbund","252432142_Total_Quality_Management_Is_It_a_Fad_Fashion_or_Fit","243463175_Cross-cultural_influences_on_quality_management_systems_two_case_studies","241194995_Benefits_of_implementing_management_system_standards_A_case_study_of_certified_companies_in_the_Pearl_River_Delta_China","235318606_Chinese_cultural_values_and_total_quality_climate","235277550_A_cross-cultural_study_of_corporate_culture_on_TQM_in_three_countries","235266885_National_culture_and_total_quality_management_Empirical_assessment_of_a_theoretical_model","228467859_Interpreting_Hofstede_Model_and_GLOBE_Model_Which_Way_to_Go_for_Cross-Cultural_Research","227429159_An_analysis_of_China-Nigeria_investment_relations","223525061_Fad_fashion_and_fit_An_examination_of_quality_circles_business_process_re-engineering_and_statistical_process_control","22310512_The_Measurement_Of_Observer_Agreement_For_Categorical_Data"]}
