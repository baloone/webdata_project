{"id":"250890657_The_Interplay_of_Numerical_and_Analytical_Solutions_of_Singular_Integral_Equations","abstract":"This paper seeks to throw light on the difficult mathematical processes by which an analytical solution of a singular integral equation is found by investigating the associated numerical procedures. As a preliminary it is necessary to develop a method for the numerical evaluation of principal valued integrals. In the subsequent solution of the singular integral equation, much of the interest arises from the part played by the end points of the range. This problem is considered in some detail.","authors":["N. Mullineux","J. R. Reed","S. J.
