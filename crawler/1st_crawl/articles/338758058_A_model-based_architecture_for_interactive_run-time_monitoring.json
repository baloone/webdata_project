{"id":"338758058_A_model-based_architecture_for_interactive_run-time_monitoring","abstract":"We present a model-based architecture for monitoring executions of models of real-time and embedded systems. This architecture is highly configurable and allows for the combination of various run-time monitoring tools, not only for observing the system execution, but also for interacting with it. Using a variety of case studies, we illustrate the use of the architecture for connecting the code generated from a model with a range of external tools for different purposes, including execution animation and run-time verification. However, the external tool can not only consume information from the execution, but also generate input for it and thus influence and steer it.","authors":["Nicolas Hili","Mojtaba Bagherzadeh","Karim Jahed","Juergen Dingel"],"meta":["July 2020Software and Systems Modeling 19(6)","DOI:10.1007/s10270-020-00780-y"],"references":["323907322_Calur_an_Action_Language_for_UML-RT_Ernesto_Posse","322977279_Survey_and_Classification_of_Model_Transformation_Tools","322977102_MDebugger_a_model-level_debugger_for_UML-RT","319251528_A_Survey_of_Runtime_Monitoring_Instrumentation_Techniques","318325191_Model-Level_Platform-Independent_Debugging_in_the_Context_of_the_Model-Driven_Development_of_Real-Time_Systems","318123173_Evaluation_of_UML-RT_and_Papyrus-RT_for_Modelling_Self-Adaptive_Systems","308941527_MDE4IoT_Supporting_the_Internet_of_Things_with_Model-Driven_Engineering","308353821_Run-time_Monitoring_of_a_Rover_MDE_Research_with_Open_Source_Software_and_Low-cost_Hardware","337528122_Verifying_and_Monitoring_UML_Models_with_Observer_Automata_A_Transformation-Free_Approach","309151077_Design_and_Analysis_of_IoT_Applications_A_Model-Driven_Approach","283847492_Software_Engineering_for_Smart_Cyber-Physical_Systems_--_Towards_a_Research_Agenda","277727180_Calvin_-_Merging_Cloud_and_IoT","303507644_Evaluation_and_Improvements_of_Runtime_Monitoring_Methods_for_Real-Time_Event_Streams","298213601_FRASAD_A_framework_for_model-driven_IoT_Application_Development","262166365_Moliz_a_model_execution_framework_for_UML_models"]}
