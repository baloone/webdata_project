{"id":"266006398_Diameters_of_classes_of_smooth_functions","abstract":"This chapter describes the asymptotic behavior of diameters of classes of smooth functions. It presents a discretization technique that reduces the problem to the estimation of the corresponding diameters in finite sequence spaces and applies this method to the estimation of n-width, approximation numbers and entropy. Birman and Solomjak conjectured that the asymptotic behavior of n-width should be better than the standard orders of the usual approximation processes.","authors":["Klaus HÃ¶llig"],"meta":["December 1980","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-213650-4.50020-9"],"references":["251388341_Approximationszahlen_von_Sobolev-Einbettungen"]}
