{"id":"322488817_Conditional_Monte_Carlo_for_sums_with_applications_to_insurance_and_finance","abstract":"Conditional Monte Carlo replaces a naive estimate Z of a number z by its conditional expectation given a suitable piece of information. It always reduces variance and its traditional applications are in that vein. We survey here other potential uses such as density estimation and calculations for Value-at-Risk and/or expected shortfall, going in part into the implementation in various copula structures. Also the interplay between these different aspects comes into play.","authors":["SÃ¸ren Asmussen"],"meta":["January 2018Annals of Actuarial Science 12(02):1-24","DOI:10.1017/S1748499517000252"],"references":["317600040_Tail_asymptotics_of_light-tailed_Weibull-like_sums","316821145_Fast_and_Accurate_Computation_of_the_Distribution_of_Sums_of_Dependent_Log-Normals","313167439_Error_rates_and_improved_algorithms_for_rare_event_simulation_with_heavy_Weibull_tails","305977953_Improved_algorithms_for_rare_event_simulation_with_heavy_tails","301390358_Quantile_Estimation_When_Applying_Conditional_Monte_Carlo","286258355_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Value-at-Risk_and_Conditional_Value-at-Risk","269355310_Error_Rates_and_Improved_Algorithms_for_Rare_Event_Simulation_with_Heavy_Weibull_Tails","266575516_Conditional_Monte_Carlo_Gradient_Estimation_and_Optimization_Applications","265727384_Stochastic_Simulation_Algorithms_and_Analysis","265461765_On_the_Convergence_Rates_of_IPA_and_FDC_Derivative_Estimators"]}
