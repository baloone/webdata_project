{"id":"312300532_Entre_a_arquivologia_e_outras_disciplinas_promessas_de_interdisciplinaridade","abstract":"This paper results from concerns about the history of uni/bi/multilateral relationships between Archival Science and other disciplines and about the tendency to naturalize interdisciplinarity as an intrinsic characteristic of disciplines in the contemporaneity. By questioning the rejection of relation between Archival Science and other disciplines on behalf of its\nscientific autonomy, as well as part of other discipline as a technique, we intend to shed light on the relationships that Archival Science has established (or not) with other disciplines in pursuing its scientific autonomy. Both sides instigate us to resume some concepts of interdisciplinarity and its ramifications aiming to understand the relations between Archival Science and other disciplines in its path of scientific development. Through a literature review we introduce some historical landmarks of Diplomatics, History, Computer Science and Information Science which we believe have a strong relationship with Archival Science. The results demonstrate an interdisciplinary relation between Archival Science and Diplomatics, and relations more specific with the other disciplines.","authors":["Angelica Alves da Cunha Marques","Nat√°lia Bolfarini Tognoli"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.21747/21836671/pag6a5"],"references":["307941203_A_Construcao_teorica_da_Diplomatica_em_busca_da_sistematizacao_de_seus_marcos_teoricos_como_subsidio_aos_estudos_arquivisticos","265273098_What_is_Past_is_Prologue_A_History_of_Archival_Ideas_Since_1898_and_the_Future_Paradigm_Shift","49472775_Archivistica_general_teoria_y_practica","44505050_A_manual_of_archive_administration_Sir_Hilary_Jenkinson"]}
