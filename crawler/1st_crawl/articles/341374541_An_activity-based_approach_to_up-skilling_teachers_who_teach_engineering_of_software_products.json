Despite the long practice of organizing the teaching of software engineering and computer science in educational organizations in Russia, relevant up-skilling courses are not methodologically supported. The paper introduces an active, practice-oriented approach to organizing up-skilling courses for teachers who teach software engineering and development. The authors developed the level model for the advanced up-skilling teachers interested in mastering and delivering modern technologies of Agile software engineering and development. Authors implemented the model for organizing teachers’ up-skilling courses in intensive schools for engineering, development, design and management of software products","authors":["K A Rutskaya","Aлександр Mоисеевич Aronov","Vladislav Rutskiy","Roman Tsarev"],"meta":["April 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1515(2):022089","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1515/2/022089"],"references":["272360138_Exploring_Principles_of_User-Centered_Agile_Software_Development_A_Literature_Review","332987291_An_Approach_to_Developing_Adaptive_Electronic_Educational_Course"]}
