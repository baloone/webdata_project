{"id":"228991216_A_note_on_critical_independence_reductions","abstract":"A criterion is specified for identifying graphs with non-empty critical independent sets. A polynomial-time algorithm is given for finding them and, thus, reducing the problem of finding a maximum independent set (MIS) in such a graph to finding a MIS in a proper subgraph. This algorithm can be extended to identify maximum cardinality critical independent sets, answering a question of Butenko and Trukhanov.","authors":["C E Larson"],"meta":["January 2007"],"references":["228809820_Using_Critical_Sets_for_the_Maximum_Independent_Set_Problem_Solving","220533308_On_Finding_Critical_Independent_and_Vertex_Sets","220532789_Finding_Critical_Independent_Sets_and_Critical_Vertex_Subsets_are_Polynomial_Problems","228603584_Graph-theoretic_independence_as_a_predictor_of_fullerene_stability_1"]}
