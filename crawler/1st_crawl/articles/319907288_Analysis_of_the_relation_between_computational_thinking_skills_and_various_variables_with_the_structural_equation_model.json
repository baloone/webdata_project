{"id":"319907288_Analysis_of_the_relation_between_computational_thinking_skills_and_various_variables_with_the_structural_equation_model","abstract":"The aim of this study is to determine how much various variables explain students' computational thinking (CT) skills. Furthermore, it was aimed to produce a model that explains and predicts the relations between computational thinking skills and various variables. Study group consists of 156 students who were studying in 5e12. Class in 2015 e2016 academic year in different schools in Ankara. Relational screening model was used in this research. Two different data collection instruments were used in this research. The first one is “Personal Information Form”. The second one is “Computational Thinking Skills Scale”. Structural Equation Model was used in data analysis so as to produce a model that explains and predicts the relations between computational thinking skills and various variables. According to research results, it was found that computational thinking skill was highly predicted by variables, respectively; “thinking styles, academic success in mathematic class, attitude against mathematic class”.","authors":["Hatice Yildiz- Durak","Mustafa Saritepeci"],"meta":["September 2017Computers & Education 116(2018):191-202","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2017.09.004"],"references":["316890358_Analyzing_the_Effect_of_Block_and_Robotic_Coding_Activities_on_Computational_Thinking_in_Programming_Education","303943002_A_Framework_for_Computational_Thinking_Based_on_a_Systematic_Research_Review","283258786_Gaming_in_Second_Life_via_Scratch4SL_Engaging_High_School_Students_in_Programming_Courses","274309848_Computational_Thinking","271746747_The_Effects_of_Teaching_Programming_via_Scratch_on_Problem_Solving_Skills_A_Discussion_from_Learners'_Perspective","266653559_The_social_turn_in_K-12_programming_Moving_from_computational_thinking_to_computational_participation","265054054_LISE_2_SINIF_OGRENCILERININ_MATEMATIK_DERSINE_YONELIK_TUTUMLARI_VE_BASARILARI_ARASINDAKI_ILISKI","263699678_CTArcade_Computational_thinking_with_games_in_school_age_children","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","258123665_Integrating_computational_thinking_with_K-12_science_education_using_agent-based_computation_A_theoretical_framework","254006849_The_fairy_performance_assessment_Measuring_computational_thinking_in_middle_school","248607142_Factors_affecting_students'_attidude_towards_Math_ABC_theory_and_its_reflection_on_practice","247924673_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_K-12_what_is_Involved_and_what_is_the_role_of_the_computer_science_education_community","234810765_Computational_thinking_for_youth_in_practice","234137078_Perceptions_of_students_and_teachers_about_the_use_of_a_kid's_programming_language_in_computer_courses","232564122_Are_cognitive_styles_still_in_style","226193639_An_Atom_is_Known_by_the_Company_it_Keeps_A_Constructionist_Learning_Environment_for_Materials_Science_Using_Agent-Based_Modeling","221538954_A_multidisciplinary_approach_towards_computational_thinking_for_science_majors","221537160_Programming_by_Choice_Urban_Youth_Learning_Programming_with_Scratch","221238412_Programming_storytelling_Opportunities_for_learning_about_coding_composition","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","220420371_Computational_thinking","345932951_Botball_Robotics_And_Gender_Differences_In_Middle_School_Teams","324340292_Overcoming_Math_Anxiety","312253565_A_validity_and_reliability_study_of_the_Computational_Thinking_Scales_CTS","311004023_A_framework_of_curriculum_design_for_computational_thinking_development_in_K-12_education","308654282_Which_cognitive_abilities_underlie_computational_thinking_Criterion_validity_of_the_Computational_Thinking_Test","303919811_Alternative_ways_of_assessing_model_fit","288953605_Strategies_in_learning_and_using_a_second_language","286547964_Factors_Effecting_Science_Achievement_of_Science_Students_in_Programme_for_International_Students'_Achievement_PISA_in_Turkey","283453083_Advancing_students'_computational_thinking_skills_through_educational_robotics_A_study_on_age_and_gender_relevant_differences","278672713_A_new_way_of_teaching_programming_skills_to_K-12_students_Codeorg","272391677_Programming_assistance_tools_to_support_the_learning_of_IT_programming_in_South_African_secondary_schools","269800445_The_Effects_of_an_Information-Technology_Gifted_Program_on_Friendship_Using_Scratch_Programming_Language_and_Clutter","266562898_Review_on_teaching_and_learning_of_computational_thinking_through_programming_What_is_next_for_K-12","265525282_COMPUTATIONAL_THINKING_AND_WOMEN_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE","265286561_Computational_Thinking_is_Pervasive","262356085_Learning_and_teaching_in_a_virtual_school","261654118_Reciprocal_Relationships_Between_Attitude_Toward_Mathematics_and_Achievement_in_Mathematics","249797728_Patterns_of_Misunderstanding_An_Integrative_Model_for_Science_Math_and_Programming","242513310_Software_Design_as_a_Learning_Environment","242091808_An_investigation_of_factors_related_to_self-efficacy_for_Java_programming_among_engineering_students","238478783_Gender_differences_in_beginning_programming_An_empirical_study_on_improving_performance_parity","235913760_Alternative_Ways_of_Assessing_Model_Fit","234837293_Multivariate_Analysis_With_Latent_Variables_Causal_Modeling","233512065_Personal_and_family_paths_to_pupil_achievement","226917404_Using_half-baked_microworlds_to_challenge_teacher_educators'_knowing","226284480_Defining_Twenty-First_Century_Skills","224205203_A_Comparison_of_Programming_Skills_by_Genders_of_Hungarian_Grammar_School_Students","220420930_The_Profession_of_IT_Beyond_Computational_Thinking","23142610_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","27301246_Beyond_computational_Thinking"]}
