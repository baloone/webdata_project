A total of 204 students participated in the study by answering the Horney-Alonso questionnaire (CHAEA). In general, results show that students tend to have a reflective learning style: BEFDR and LRD (14.34 ± 2.92), and BPSF (14.48 ± 2.72). As a conclusion, it was determined that the trend towards reflective learning is characteristic of those who received behavioral methodologies during their school career. In addition, due to the practical emphasis of the Physical Education and Sports Performance programs, their students tend to be more active.","authors":["Jorge Salas-Cabrera"],"meta":["December 2014Revista Electrónica Educare 18(3):159-171","DOI:10.15359/ree.18-3.9"],"references":["24012495_Psychometric_properties_of_the_Fagerstrom_Test_for_Nicotine_Dependence","277856788_Identificacion_de_los_estilos_de_aprendizaje_en_los_estudiantes_de_fisiologia_del_ejercicio_de_la_Facultad_de_Rehabilitacion_y_Desarrollo_Humano","275181049_Using_Learning_Styles_Inventories_to_Promote_Active_Learning","269391432_Manual_de_tabaquismo","201381910_Using_Our_Learning_Styles","49544761_Metodologia_de_la_investigacion","31727772_Aprender_con_mapas_mentales_una_estrategia_para_pensar_y_estudiar_A_Ontoria_Pena_JPR_Gomez_A_de_Luque","28059717_Rasgos_de_personalidad_del_adolescente_fumador","20100835_Drug_therapy_Pharmacologic_aspects_of_cigarette_smoking_and_nicotine_addition"]}
