{"id":"336835095_Survey_paper_on_Advanced_Equipment_Execution_of_ANN_for_FPGA","abstract":"Artificial intelligence is the area of computer science that aims at to create the intelligence machine. Artificial neural network is network that has different processing element. This survey paper recommends the implementation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and activates it through sigmoid function. This paper also proposes the implementation of new sigmoid function method in FPGA that combines the Look-Up Table (LUT) and Second Order Nonlinear Function (SONF). By this proposed method ANN works speedily, uses less resource and achieves high accuracy.","authors":["Saima Kanwal","Arslan Yousaf","Maria Imtiaz","Jalil Abbas"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":["316756708_Design_and_Implementation_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_for_Mobile_Robot_based_on_FPGA","273246843_Comparison_of_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Learning_Algorithms_for_Pattern_Classification","268369195_Design_and_Implementation_of_Neural_Networks_Neurons_with_RadBas_LogSig_and_TanSig_Activation_Functions_on_FPGA","262368547_A_Fully_Pipelined_FPGA_Architecture_of_a_Factored_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine_Artificial_Neural_Network","261803532_Hardware_Implementation_of_Artificial_Neural_Network_Using_Field_Programmable_Gate_Array","228345013_High_Speed_VLSI_Implementation_of_the_Hyperbolic_Tangent_Sigmoid_Function","309456244_Research_paper_on_basic_of_Artificial_Neural_Network","261318829_A_non-linear_approximation_of_the_sigmoid_function_based_on_FPGA","257512749_Comparative_investigation_of_non-linear_activation_functions_in_neural_controllers_for_search-based_game_AI_engineering","242600969_Neural_Network_Implementation_Using_FPGA_Issues_and_Application","224843989_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_A_SIGMOID_ACTIVATION_FUNCTION_FOR_NEURAL_NETWORK_USING_FPGA","224227651_Automatic_Landing_Control_System_Design_Using_Adaptive_Neural_Network_and_Its_Hardware_Realization","220366237_FPGA_Implementation_of_the_Multilayer_Neural_Network_for_the_Speed_Estimation_of_the_Two-Mass_Drive_System","5606751_A_digital_hardware_pulse-mode_neuron_with_piecewise_linear_activation_function_IEEE_Transactions_on_Neural_Networks_145_1028-1037"]}
