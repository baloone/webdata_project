{"id":"304364387_A_Tree-Based_Distributed_Permutation_Routing_Protocol_in_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Sensors_Network","abstract":"A Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) is an\nad-hoc network populated by small hand-held commodity devices, running on\nbatteries called stations or sensors. Often used in hostiles and sometimes\nunreachable environments, stations are subject to energetic constraints which\ncan significantly decrease the network life time. Permutation routing problem\nis mainly found in the literature of WSN. This problem occurs when some\nstations have items that belong either or not to them. The goal is to send each\nitem to its receiver. To solve this problem, several works are presented in the\nliterature. In this paper, we present a new permutation routing protocol for\nmulti-hop wireless sensors network that, compared to recent work in the field\nis more efficient in terms of conservation of sensors’ energy, which results in\na longer life time of the network. Also, contrary to some other routing\nprotocols which assume that the memory of the sensors is infinite, we show that\nthe memory size of the sensors is limited, which in our opinion is more\nrealistic.","authors":["Alain Bertrand Bomgni","Elie Fute Tagne","Foko Sindjoung Miguel Landry Miguel Landry","Clémentin Tayou Djamegni"],"meta":["January 2016Wireless Sensor Network 08(06):93-105","DOI:10.4236/wsn.2016.86010"],"references":["263525201_Training_a_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Algorithmic_Solutions_for_Wireless_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_and_Sensor_Networks_Guest_Editors_Amotz_Bar-Noy_Alan_A_Bertossi_Cristina_M_Pinotti_and_Cauligi_S_Raghavendra","228447155_An_Efficient_Permutation_Routing_Protocol_in_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224398505_Distributed_scheduling_for_multi-hop_wireless_networks","325420321_Energy_efficient_clustering_in_wireless_sensor_networks","251957048_A_clustering_patch_hierarchical_routing_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","234797419_Wireless_Integrated_Network_Sensors_WINS","224226288_A_comparative_analysis_of_routing_techniques_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224071752_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","221426487_New_Energy-Efficient_Permutation_Routing_Protocol_for_Single-Hop_Radio_Networks","221242860_Distributed_Clustering_in_Ad-hoc_Sensor_Networks_A_Hybrid_Energy-Efficient_Approach"]}
