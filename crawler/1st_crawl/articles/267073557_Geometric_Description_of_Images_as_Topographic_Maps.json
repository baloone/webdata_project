{"id":"267073557_Geometric_Description_of_Images_as_Topographic_Maps","abstract":"The tree of shapes of an image, as a unified mix of the component trees, was presented and analyzed in the present notes. Its existence was proven for a semicontinuous image. It relies on the simple model according to which shapes have mostly uniform reflectance properties and are distinguishable from the background. This model has no parameters and is well-posed, though it cannot really account for occlusions and subjective contours notably. The classical area openings of mathematical morphology have their counterpart in the grain filter, which has the advantage of being self-dual on continuous images. If small grains, or small shapes, are filtered out, the tree has a structure essentially finite, and a weak Morse theory was developed under these assumptions: several notions of singularity or criticality were defined and shown to be equivalent. To close the theoretical part, the procedure merging the component trees to build the tree of shapes was detailed, providing an algorithm valid in any dimension. In the most frequent two-dimensional case, a more efficient algorithm, the Fast Level Set Transform, was described. Though not as fast as an optimized component tree algorithm, the FLST is quite usable. A variant based on a bilinear interpolation of the image was also presented, which has the advantage of exhibiting more regular level lines. However, it is slightly slower than the FLST and needs as parameters the levels of quantization to represent the image in a finite structure. Finally, a wide range of concrete applications was exposed and briefly explained.","authors":["Vicent Caselles","Pascal Monasse"],"meta":["January 2010Lecture Notes in Mathematics -Springer-verlag- 1984","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-04611-7","ISBN: 978-3-642-04610-0"],"references":["243774048_The_Topographic_Primal_Sketch","227337566_A_Kanizsa_Programme","227276846_Topological_Zone_Organization_of_Scalar_Volume_Data","225664172_Constructing_the_Tree_of_Shapes_of_an_Image_by_Fusion_of_the_Trees_of_Connected_Components_of_Upper_and_Lower_Level_Sets","5567349_Morphological_operators_for_image_and_video_compression","2575217_Fast_Isocontouring_For_Improved_Interactivity","2519826_The_Tree_of_Shapes_of_an_Image","2307030_Contour_Trees_and_Small_Seed_Sets_for_Isosurface_Traversal","254627727_Morse_Description_and_Morphological_Encoding_of_Continuous_Data","239059528_Morphological_multiscale_segmentation_for_image_coding","230837988_Extracting_Topographic_Terrain_Features_from_Elevation_Maps","225778821_Application_of_the_Gestalt_principles_to_the_detection_of_good_continuations_and_corners_in_image_level_lines","224112261_Digital_Detection_of_Pits_Peaks_Ridges_and_Ravines","223517439_Convergence_continuity_and_iteration_in_mathematical_morphology","223239923_Geodesic_methods_in_quantitative_image_analysis","222721675_Adjacency_lattices_and_shape-tree_semilattices","221991372_Scale-Space_from_a_Level_Lines_Tree","220646339_A_three-dimensional_holes_closing_algorithm","220645542_If_we_use_4-_or_8-connectedness_for_both_the_objects_and_the_background_the_Euler_characteristics_is_not_locally_computable","220632645_A_new_three-dimensional_connected_components_algorithm","220632232_Holes_and_Genus_of_2D_and_3D_Digital_Images","220444402_Fundamenta_Morphologicae_Mathematicae","220145986_Self-dual_morphological_operators_and_filters","8264916_Morse_Description_and_Geometric_Encoding_of_Digital_Elevation_Maps","6151804_A_Topdown_Algorithm_for_Computation_of_Level_Line_Trees","5576292_Affine_plane_curve_evolution_A_fully_consistent_scheme"]}
