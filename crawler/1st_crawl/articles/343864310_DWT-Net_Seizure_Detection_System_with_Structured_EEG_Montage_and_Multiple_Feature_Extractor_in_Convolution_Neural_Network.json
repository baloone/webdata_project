{"id":"343864310_DWT-Net_Seizure_Detection_System_with_Structured_EEG_Montage_and_Multiple_Feature_Extractor_in_Convolution_Neural_Network","abstract":"Automated seizure detection system based on electroencephalograms (EEG) is an interdisciplinary research problem between computer science and neuroscience. Epileptic seizure affects 1% of the worldwide population and can lead to severe long-term harm to safety and life quality. The automation of seizure detection can greatly improve the treatment of patients. In this work, we propose a neural network model to extract features from EEG signals with a method of arranging the dimension of feature extraction inspired by the traditional method of neurologists. A postprocessor is used to improve the output of the classifier. The result of our seizure detection system on the TUSZ dataset reaches a false alarm rate of 12 per 24 hours with a sensitivity of 59%, which approaches the performance of average human detector based on qEEG tools.","authors":["Zhe Zhang","Yun Ren","Nabil Sabor","Jing Pan"],"meta":["August 2020Journal of Sensors 2020(7):1-13","DOI:10.1155/2020/3083910"],"references":["333593542_Seizure_Type_Classification_on_EEG_Signal_using_Support_Vector_Machine","327629828_Sample_Entropy_on_Multidistance_Signal_Level_Difference_for_Epileptic_EEG_Classification","327214532_Multiple_Wavelet_Coefficients_Fusion_in_Deep_Residual_Networks_for_Fault_Diagnosis","324018376_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_the_Automated_Diagnosis_of_Congestive_Heart_Failure_Using_ECG_Signals","333861089_ChronoNet_A_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Abnormal_EEG_Identification","332641741_Classification_of_epileptic_EEG_recordings_using_signal_transforms_and_convolutional_neural_networks","331456714_Overview_of_EEG_Electrode_Placement_and_Montages_Essentials_for_Trainees","331205714_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Epileptic_Seizure_Prediction","330472732_Deep_Architectures_for_Spatio-Temporal_Modeling_Automated_Seizure_Detection_in_Scalp_EEGs","325207699_A_Long_Short-Term_Memory_deep_learning_network_for_the_prediction_of_epileptic_seizures_using_EEG_signals"]}
