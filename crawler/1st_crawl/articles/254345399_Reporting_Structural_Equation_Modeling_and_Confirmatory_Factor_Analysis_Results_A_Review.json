{"id":"254345399_Reporting_Structural_Equation_Modeling_and_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_Results_A_Review","abstract":"The authors provide a basic set of guidelines and recommendations for information that should be included in any manuscript that has confirmatory factor analysis or structural equation modeling as the primary statistical analysis technique. The authors provide an introduction to both techniques, along with sample analyses, recommendations for reporting, evaluation of articles in The Journal of Educational Research using these techniques, and concluding remarks.","authors":["James B.
