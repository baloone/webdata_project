{"id":"339650985_Quantum_Science_and_Quantum_Technology","abstract":"Quantum science and quantum technology are of great current interest in multiple frontiers of many scientific fields ranging from computer science to physics and chemistry, and from engineering to mathematics and statistics. Their developments will likely lead to a new wave of scientific revolutions and technological innovations in a wide range of scientific studies and applications. This paper provides a brief review on quantum communication, quantum information, quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. We present essential quantum properties, illustrate relevant concepts of quantum science and quantum technology, and discuss their scientific developments. We point out the need for statistical analysis in their developments, as well as their potential applications to and impacts on statistics and data science.","authors":["Yazhen Wang","Xinyu Song"],"meta":["February 2020Statistical Science 35(1):51-74","DOI:10.1214/19-STS745"],"references":["321374966_Toward_the_first_quantum_simulation_with_quantum_speedup","319953599_A_blueprint_for_demonstrating_quantum_supremacy_with_superconducting_qubits","318721159_Quantum_machine_learning_A_classical_perspective","337792651_Experimental_Bayesian_Quantum_Phase_Estimation_on_a_Silicon_Photonic_Chip","323562671_Machine_learning_artificial_intelligence_in_the_quantum_domain_A_review_of_recent_progress","319683742_Post-quantum_cryptography","319683732_Quantum_Computational_Supremacy","319683702_Programming_languages_and_compiler_design_for_realistic_quantum_hardware","319683691_Roads_towards_fault-tolerant_universal_quantum_computation","318091190_Satellite-Based_Entanglement_Distribution_Over_1200_kilometers"]}
