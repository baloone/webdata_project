{"id":"262369794_Attacking_exponent_blinding_in_RSA_without_CRT","abstract":"A standard SPA protection for RSA implementations is exponent blinding (see [7]). Fouque et al., [4] and more recently Schindler and Itoh, [8] have described side-channel attacks against such implementations. The attack in [4] requires that the attacker knows some bits of the blinded exponent with certainty. The attack methods of [8] can be defeated by choosing a sufficiently large blinding factor (about 64 bit).\nIn this paper we start from a more realistic model for the information an attacker can obtain by simple power analysis (SPA) than the one that forms the base of the attack in [4]. We show how the methods of [4] can be extended to work in this setting. This new attack works, under certain restrictions, even for long blinding factors (i.e. 64 bit or more).","authors":["Sven Bauer"],"meta":["May 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-29912-4_7","Conference: Proceedings of the Third international conference on Constructive Side-Channel Analysis and Secure Design"],"references":["221651914_Exponent_Blinding_Does_Not_Always_Lift_Partial_Spa_Resistance_to_Higher-Level_Security","221354730_Reconstructing_RSA_Private_Keys_from_Random_Key_Bits","221291626_Sliding_Windows_Succumbs_to_Big_Mac_Attack","221291583_Template_Attacks","221260534_Lest_We_Remember_Cold_Boot_Attacks_on_Encryption_Keys","220423789_Lest_We_Remember_Cold-Boot_Attacks_on_Encryption_Keys","220333016_Horizontal_Correlation_Analysis_on_Exponentiation","48412694_Power_Attack_on_Small_RSA_Public_Exponent","2582060_Timing_Attacks_on_Implementations_of_Diffie-Hellman_RSA_DSS_and_Other_Systems","2538368_Twenty_Years_of_Attacks_on_the_RSA_Cryptosystem"]}
