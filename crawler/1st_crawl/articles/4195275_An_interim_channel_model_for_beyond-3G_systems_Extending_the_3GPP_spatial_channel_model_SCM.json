{"id":"4195275_An_interim_channel_model_for_beyond-3G_systems_Extending_the_3GPP_spatial_channel_model_SCM","abstract":"This paper reports on the interim beyond-3G (B3G) channel model developed by and used within the European WINNER project. The model is a comprehensive spatial channel model for 2 and 5 GHz frequency bands and supports bandwidths up to 100 MHz in three different outdoor environments. It further features time-evolution of system-level parameters for challenging advanced communication algorithms, as well as a reduced-variability tapped delay-line model for improved usability in calibration and comparison simulations.","authors":["D.s.
