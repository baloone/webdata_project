{"id":"315635830_Catalyst_grading_optimization_and_kinetic_simulation_of_shale_oil_hydrotreating_process","abstract":"The shale oil hydrogenation experiments were conducted on fixed-bed reactor with grading of hydrogenating protective catalyst (HP), Hydrofining catalyst (HF) and hydrocracking catalyst (HC). The effects of reaction temperature and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on products distribution of shale oil hydrotreating were investigated. Three kinds of lumping kinetics models for hydrodearomatization(HDA), hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) were firstly established and applied in this process. The predicted reactive features and optimized operating conditions for HDS, HDN, and HDA were agreed well with experimental results at different catalyst grading ratios, with a relative error of less than 3.8 %. In accordance with operating conditions, the model can also be applied in catalyst grading scale calculation, which enhances the theory of shale oil hydro-upgrading application.","authors":["Hongyan Wang","Fei Dai","Yiqian Yang","Zengxi Li"],"meta":["March 2017Energy & Fuels 31(4)","DOI:10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b02720"],"references":["260225410_Catalytic_hydrorefining_of_tar_to_liquid_fuel_over_multi-metals_W-Mo-Ni_catalysts_Catalytic_hydrorefining_of_tar_to_liquid_fuel_over_multi-metals_W-Mo-Ni_catalysts","235642619_The_role_of_MoS2_nano-slabs_in_the_protection_of_solid_cracking_catalysts_for_the_total_conversion_of_heavy_oils_to_good_quality_distillates","282557230_Upgrading_Shale_Oil_Distillation_to_Clean_Fuel_by_Coupled_Hydrogenation_and_Ring_Opening_Reaction_of_Aromatics_on_W-Nig-Al2O3_Catalysts","282352457_Carbon-Number-Based_Kinetics_Reactor_Modeling_and_Process_Simulation_for_Coal_Tar_Hydrogenation","281393432_Study_on_palm_oil_hydrogenation_for_clean_fuel_over_Ni-Mo-Wg-Al2O3-ZSM-5_catalyst","276024308_HYDROFLUORIC_ACID-BASED_ULTRASONIC_UPGRADING_OF_OIL_SHALE_AND_ITS_STRUCTURE_CHARACTERIZATION","273647294_Effect_of_nitrogen_compounds_in_the_hydrodesulfurization_of_straight-run_gas_oil_using_a_CoMoPg-Al2O3_catalyst","269663218_Lumping_kinetics_of_hydrodesulfurization_and_hydrodenitrogenation_of_the_middle_distillate_from_chinese_shale_oil","267455506_New_kinetic_model_of_coal_tar_hydrogenation_process_via_carbon_number_component_approach","263947018_Detailed_Description_of_Coal_Tar_Hydrogenation_Process_Using_the_Kinetic_Lumping_Approach","260837417_Upgrading_of_Estonian_shale_oil_heavy_residuum_bituminous_fraction_by_catalytic_hydroconversion","257683105_ChlorogallateIII_ionic_liquids_Synthesis_acidity_determination_and_their_catalytic_performances_for_isobutane_alkylation","257210531_The_pyrolysis_extraction_and_kinetics_of_Buton_oil_sand_bitumen","257157666_Yield_and_characteristics_of_shale_oil_from_the_retorting_of_oil_shale_and_fine_oil-shale_ash_mixtures","254328606_Steady-State_and_Dynamic_Reactor_Models_for_Hydrotreatment_of_Oil_Fractions_A_Review","250207354_Hydrodesulfurization_and_hydrodenitrogenation_of_diesel_distillate_from_fushun_shale_oil","244361922_Testing_of_hydrodesulfurization_process_in_small_trickle-bed_reactor","244320809_Deep_Hydrotreating_of_Middle_Distillates_from_Crude_and_Shale_Oils","244238493_Mathematical_models_for_kinetics_of_batchwise_hydrogenation_of_shale_oil","244238299_Inhibition_of_Nitrogen_Compounds_on_the_Hydrodesulfurization_of_Substituted_Dibenzothiophenes_in_Light_Cycle_Oil","244066957_Medium_severity_hydrotreating_and_hydrocracking_of_Israeli_shale_oil_-_II_Testing_of_novel_catalyst_systems_in_a_trickle_bed_reactor","232328811_Upgrading_of_distillate_fractions_of_Timahdit_Moroccan_shale_oil_over_a_sulphided_NiOMoO3gAl2O3_catalyst","222170404_Medium-Severity_Hydrotreating_and_Hydrocracking_of_Israeli_Shale_Oil_1_Novel_Catalyst_Systems","11579019_Differential_fraction-based_kinetic_model_for_simulating_hydrodesulfurization_process_of_petroleum_fraction"]}
