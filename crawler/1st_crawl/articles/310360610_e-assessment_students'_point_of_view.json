{"id":"310360610_e-assessment_students'_point_of_view","abstract":"In this paper we discuss the use of e-assessment tools in a beginners programming course. Online exams do have certain advantages, the instant feedback is valuable for students and the time factor is welcomed by teachers. The limitations are often technically related, e.g. the opportunities the assessment tools offer, because different exam environments can also be stressful for students. In an introductory programming course where the emphasis is on coding, automatic systems can be used when evaluating the students. In this paper we describe the results of a survey of students' attitudes towards sitting automated exams in the same or similar environment they program in during the semester.","authors":["Ásrún Matthíasdóttir","Hallgrímur Arnalds"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2983468.2983497","Conference: the 17th International Conference"],"references":["273188579_Teaching_Introductory_Programming_A_Quantitative_Evaluation_of_Different_Approaches","348865291_Visible_Learning_for_Teachers","301444832_Rethinking_teaching_and_assessing_in_a_programming_course_a_case_study","283873016_Computerized_testing_A_vision_and_initial_experiences","270585208_Visible_Learning_for_Teachers_Maximising_Impact_on_Learning","235969917_Blended_e-assessment_Migrating_Classical_exams_to_the_digital_world","220795743_The_novice_problem_in_computer_science"]}
