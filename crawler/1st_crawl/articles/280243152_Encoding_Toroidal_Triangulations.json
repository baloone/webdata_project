{"id":"280243152_Encoding_Toroidal_Triangulations","abstract":"Poulalhon and Schaeffer introduced an elegant method to linearly encode a\nplanar triangulation optimally. The method is based on performing a special\ndepth-first search algorithm on a particular orientation of the triangulation:\nthe minimal Schnyder wood. Recent progress toward generalizing Schnyder woods\nto higher genus enables us to generalize this method to the toroidal case. In\nthe plane, the method leads to a bijection between planar triangulations and\nsome particular trees. For the torus we obtain a similar bijection but with\nparticular unicellular maps (maps with only one face).","authors":["Vincent Despré","Daniel Gonçalves","Benjamin Lévêque"],"meta":["April 2017Discrete & Computational Geometry 57(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9832-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235798603_Geometric_Representations_of_Graphs_with_Low_Polygonal_Complexity","228925787_Optimal_encoding_of_triangular_and_quadrangular_meshes_with_fixed_topology","314080152_Generalization_of_Schnyder_woods_to_orientable_surfaces_and_applications","288868633_Bijective_Counting_of_Tree-Rooted_Maps_and_Shuffles_of_Parenthesis_Systems","284504513_Uniform_random_sampling_of_simple_branched_coverings_of_the_sphere_by_itself","274227721_Graphs_Surfaces_and_Homology","269722175_Orienting_Triangulations","236635108_A_Generic_Method_for_Bijections_between_Blossoming_Trees_and_Planar_Maps","229176110_Orientations_bipolaires","227118650_Optimal_Coding_and_Sampling_of_Triangulations","226656105_Planar_graphs_and_poset_dimension","225933363_Drawing_Planar_Graphs_Using_the_Canonical_Ordering","222831460_A_bijection_for_covered_maps_or_a_shortcut_between_Harer-Zagier's_and_Jackson's_formulas","221661934_Toroidal_Maps_Schnyder_Woods_Orthogonal_Surfaces_and_Straight-Line_Representations","220994469_An_Information-Theoretic_Upper_Bound_of_Planar_Graphs_Using_Triangulation"]}
