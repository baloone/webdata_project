{"id":"321892600_Head_and_Body_Orientation_Estimation_Using_Convolutional_Random_Projection_Forests","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the head pose and body orientation of a person from a low-resolution image. Under this setting, it is difficult to reliably extract facial features or detect body parts. We propose a convolutional random projection forest (CRPforest) algorithm for these tasks. A convolutional random projection network (CRPnet) is used at each node of the forest. It maps an input image to a high-dimensional feature space using a rich filter bank. The filter bank is designed to generate sparse responses so that they can be efficiently computed by compressive sensing. A sparse random projection matrix can capture most essential information contained in the filter bank without using all the filters in it. Therefore, the CRPnet is fast, e.g., it requires\n$0.04\\;\\mathrm{ms}$ \nto process an image of\n$50\\times 50$ \npixels, due to the small number of convolutions (e.g., 0.01 percent of a layer of a neural network) at the expense of less than 2 percent accuracy. The overall forest estimates head and body pose well on benchmark datasets, e.g., over 98 percent on the HIIT dataset, while requiring\n$3.8\\;\\mathrm{ms}$ \nwithout using a GPU. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in low-resolution images with noise, occlusion, and motion blur.","authors":["Donghoon Lee","Ming-Hsuan Yang","Songhwai Oh"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2784424"],"references":["319770242_Mid-level_Deep_Pattern_Mining","300412490_Deep_Neural_Decision_Forests","282065131_Head_Pose_Estimation_via_Probabilistic_High-Dimensional_Regression","275670269_Mid-level_Elements_for_Object_Detection","271527981_Head_Pose_Estimation_Based_on_Face_Symmetry_Analysis","271273321_Integrated_Pedestrian_and_Direction_Classification_using_a_Random_Decision_Forest","265210916_Fast_Compressive_Tracking","262675835_Head_Pose_Estimation_by_Instance_Parameterization","261154943_On_partial_least_squares_in_head_pose_estimation_How_to_simultaneously_deal_with_misalignment","221653456_Very_sparse_random_projections","221545758_Head_Pose_Estimation_in_Seminar_Room_Using_Multi_View_Face_Detectors","221365013_Integrated_Pedestrian_Classification_and_Orientation_Estimation","221364708_Real-Time_Human_Pose_Recognition_in_Parts_from_Single_Depth_Images","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","221337720_Learning_Discriminative_Appearance-Based_Models_Using_Partial_Least_Squares","221304284_Multi-class_Classification_on_Riemannian_Manifolds_for_Video_Surveillance","221259232_Head_Pose_Classification_in_Crowded_Scenes","221110585_Fully_automatic_pose-invariant_face_recognition_via_3D_pose_normalization","5305936_Tracking_the_Visual_Focus_of_Attention_for_a_Varying_Number_of_Wandering_People","4136961_A_Methodology_for_Evaluating_Robustness_of_Face_Recognition_Algorithms_with_Respect_to_Variations_in_Pose_Angle_and_Illumination_Angle","4121835_Flexible_cooperation_between_human_and_robot_by_interpreting_human_intention_from_gaze_information","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","308826195_Mid-level_deep_pattern_mining","308819520_Head_pose_estimation_in_the_wild_using_approximate_view_manifolds","301452548_Deep_Face_Recognition","300412772_Fast_and_Accurate_Head_Pose_Estimation_via_Random_Projection_Forests","300358778_Context_as_Supervisory_Signal_Discovering_Objects_with_Predictable_Context","273841137_VoD_A_novel_image_representation_for_head_yaw_estimation","263002356_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context","261840060_Head_pose_estimation_using_image_abstraction_and_local_directional_quaternary_patterns_for_multiclass_classification","261387092_Automatic_head_pose_estimation_using_randomly_projected_dense_SIFT_descriptors","261157779_Efficient_and_robust_integration_of_face_detection_and_head_pose_estimation","257672285_A_Two-Layer_Framework_for_Piecewise_Linear_Manifold-Based_Head_Pose_Estimation","240308784_Characterizing_Humans_on_Riemannian_Manifolds","238625098_On_the_Algorithmic_Implementation_of_Multiclass_Kernel-based_Vector_Machines","224952018_Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Mid-Level_Discriminative_Patches","224254947_Supervised_Local_Subspace_Learning_for_Continuous_Head_Pose_Estimation","222430190_Social_Signal_Processing_Survey_of_an_Emerging_Domain","221364197_Real_time_head_pose_estimation_with_random_regression_forests","221120316_Robust_head_pose_estimation_via_Convex_Regularized_Sparse_Regression","44618705_Multi-PIE","24026969_Head_Pose_Estimation_in_Computer_Vision_A_Survey"]}
