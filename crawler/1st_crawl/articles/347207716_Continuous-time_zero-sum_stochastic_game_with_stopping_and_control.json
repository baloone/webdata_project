{"id":"347207716_Continuous-time_zero-sum_stochastic_game_with_stopping_and_control","abstract":"We consider a zero-sum stochastic game for continuous-time Markov chain with countable state space and unbounded transition and pay-off rates. The additional feature of the game is that the controllers together with taking actions are also allowed to stop the process. Under suitable hypothesis we show that the game has a value and it is the unique solution of certain dynamic programming inequalities with bilateral constraints. In the process we also prescribe a saddle point equilibrium.","authors":["Chandan Pal","Subhamay Saha"],"meta":["November 2020Operations Research Letters 48(6):715-719","DOI:10.1016/j.orl.2020.08.012"],"references":["332653789_Nonzero-sum_Games_for_Continuous-Time_Jump_Processes_Under_the_Expected_Average_Payoff_Criterion","281084276_Nash_equilibria_of_threshold_type_for_two-player_nonzero-sum_games_of_stopping","257213026_A_survey_of_recent_results_on_continuous-time_Markov_decision_processes","227231846_New_optimality_conditions_for_average-payoff_continuous-time_Markov_games_in_Polish_spaces","220259645_The_Value_of_Zero-Sum_Stopping_Games_in_Continuous_Time","38322447_Zero-sum_continuous-time_Markov_games_with_unbounded_transition_and_discounted_payoff_rates","5070651_Continuous-Time_Dynkin_Games_with_Mixed_Strategies","2115336_Two-player_nonZero-sum_stopping_games_in_discrete_time","267005907_Optimal_Stopped_Games","259633513_The_multi-player_nonzero-sum_Dynkin_game_in_discrete_time","249469384_Zero-sum_stochastic_games_with_stopping_and_control","243092862_Measurable_Selection_Theorems_for_Minimax_Stochastic_Optimization_Problems","239060236_Game_Variant_Problem_on_Optimal_Stopping","232913482_Dynkin_games_and_martingale_methods","226886378_Zero-sum_Markov_games_with_stopping_and_impulsive_strategies","222567040_BSDEs_with_two_RCLL_Reflecting_Obstacles_driven_by_a_Brownian_Motion_and_Poisson_Measure_and_related_Mixed_Zero-Sum_Games","220442731_Discounted_Continuous-Time_Markov_Decision_Processes_with_Constraints_Unbounded_Transition_and_Loss_Rates","7191210_Fixed_Point_and_Minimax_Theorems_in_Locally_Convex_Topological_Linear_Spaces","5201723_Stopping_Games_with_Randomized_Strategies"]}
