{"id":"262365011_Paper_Model_predictive_heuristic_control","abstract":"A new method of digital process control is described. It relies on three principles: 1.(a) The multivariable plant is represented by its impulse responses which will be used on line by the control computer for long range prediction; 2.(b) The behavior of the closed-loop system is prescribed by means of reference trajectories initiated on the actual outputs; 3.(c) The control variables are computed in a heuristic way with the same procedure used in identification, which appears as a dual of the control under this formulation. This method has been continuously and successfully applied to a dozen large scale industrial processes for more than a year's time. Its effectiveness is due to the ease of its implementation (e.g. constraints on the control variables) and to its amazing robustness as concerns structural perturbations. The economics of this control scheme is eloquent and figures can be put forward to demonstrate its efficiency. Optimality does not come from extraneous criteria on the control actions but from minimization of the error variance which permits computation of the set points of the dynamic control in a hierarchical way.","authors":["Jacques Richalet","A.
