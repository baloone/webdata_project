{"id":"281487297_Interdisciplinary_and_physics_challenges_of_Network_Theory","abstract":"Network theory has unveiled the underlying structure of complex systems such\nas the Internet or the biological networks in the cell. It has identified\nuniversal properties of complex networks, and the interplay between their\nstructure and dynamics. After almost twenty years of the field, new challenges\nlie ahead. These challenges concern the multilayer structure of most of the\nnetworks, the formulation of a network geometry and topology, and the\ndevelopment of a quantum theory of networks. Making progress on these aspects\nof network theory can open new venues to address interdisciplinary and physics\nchallenges including progress on brain dynamics, new insights into quantum\ntechnologies, and quantum gravity.","authors":["Ginestra Bianconi"],"meta":["September 2015EPL (Europhysics Letters) 111(5)","DOI:10.1209/0295-5075/111/56001","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280589842_A_geometric_entropy_detecting_the_Erdos-R'enyi_phase_transition","278048797_Complex_Quantum_Network_Manifolds_in_Dimension_d2_are_Scale-Free","277885320_Editorial_Can_There_Be_a_Physics_of_the_Brain","273704001_Complex_Quantum_Network_Geometries_Evolution_and_Phase_Transitions","272184727_Mutually_connected_component_of_network_of_networks_with_replica_nodes","332349740_Studies_in_Philosophy_and_the_History_of_Philosophy_Volume_I","292856248_Multiplex_Networks","291175221_Covariant_Loop_Quantum_Gravity","284332960_Handbook_of_Discrete_and_Computational_Geometry","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction"]}
