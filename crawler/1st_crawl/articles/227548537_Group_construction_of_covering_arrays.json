{"id":"227548537_Group_construction_of_covering_arrays","abstract":"A covering array t-CA (n, k, g) is a k × n array on a set of g symbols with the property that in each t × n subarray, every t × 1 column appears at least once. This paper improves many of the best known upper bounds on n for covering arrays, 2-CA (n, k, g) with g + 1 ≤ k ≤ 2g, for g = 3 · · · 12 by a construction which in many of these cases produces a 2-CA (n, k, g) with n = k (g − 1) + 1. The construction is an extension of an algebraic method used by Chateauneuf, Colbourn, and Kreher which uses an array and a group action on the array. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
