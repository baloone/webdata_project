We (i) investigate means to incorporate direct measurements to MPC (ii) introduce two Robust MPC techniques e Certainty Equivalence control (CE) and Disturbance Affine Feedback Control (DA) e to mitigate the uncertainty of weather forecasts, and (iii) provide conditions to obtain two important theoretical aspects of MPC e feasibility and stability e in the context of irrigation control. Our results show that system identification enables automation while incorporating direct measurements. Both DA and CE minimize RZSMD and irrigation amount under uncertain weather forecasts and always maintain soil moisture above wilting point subject to water availability. The theoretical results are compared against the model AQUACROP, weather data and forecasts from Shep-parton, Australia. We also discuss the performance of Robust MPC under different water availability, soil, crop conditions. In general, MPC shows to be a promising tool for irrigation control.","authors":["D. K.
