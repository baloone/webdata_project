{"id":"304778603_Systems_and_Software_Engineering_Standards_for_Very_Small_Entities_Accomplishments_and_Overview_-_IEEE_Computer","abstract":"A large majority of organizations very small entities (VSEs)—commercial, government, or not-for-profit organizations; departments; or projects with up to 25 people who develop systems with hardware and software components and/or software products. Their products are sold to their customers directly or are integrated into those developed by larger organizations, possibly distributed to thousands of users worldwide, as illustrated in Figure 1. A supply chain of large products often has a pyramidal structure composed of many first, second and third level suppliers. If an undetected defect is left in a low level component, once this component is integrated in a higher level component, the defect may still be undetected. This defective component, once integrated in the final product, could result in a loss of millions of dollars by the manufacturer.","authors":["Claude Y. Laporte","Rory V.
