{"id":"329479316_Binary_Locating-Dominating_Sets_in_Rotationally-Symmetric_Convex_Polytopes","abstract":"A convex polytope or simply polytope is the convex hull of a finite set of points in Euclidean space R d . Graphs of convex polytopes emerge from geometric structures of convex polytopes by preserving the adjacency-incidence relation between vertices. In this paper, we study the problem of binary locating-dominating number for the graphs of convex polytopes which are symmetric rotationally. We provide an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for the binary locating-dominating problem of graphs. We have determined the exact values of the binary locating-dominating number for two infinite families of convex polytopes. The exact values of the binary locating-dominating number are obtained for two rotationally-symmetric convex polytopes families. Moreover, certain upper bounds are determined for other three infinite families of convex polytopes. By using the ILP formulation, we show tightness in the obtained upper bounds.","authors":["Hassan Raza","Sakander Hayat","Xiang-Feng Pan"],"meta":["December 2018Symmetry 10(12):727","DOI:10.3390/sym10120727"],"references":["327054293_The_binary_locating-dominating_number_of_some_convex_polytopes","299609975_On_the_metric_dimension_of_rotationally-symmetric_convex_polytopes","299547994_Computing_the_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes_generated_by_wheel_related_graphs","299397646_Computing_Topological_Indices_of_Honeycomb_Derived_Networks","283848500_New_variable_neighbourhood_search_based_0-1_MIP_heuristics","276422416_On_the_metric_dimension_of_two_families_of_convex_polytopes","326929185_On_the_fault-tolerant_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes","323942552_Valency-based_topological_descriptors_of_chemical_networks_and_their_applications","320089137_Computing_distance-based_topological_descriptors_of_complex_chemical_networks_New_theoretical_techniques","284778192_Open_neighborhood_locating-dominating_sets"]}
