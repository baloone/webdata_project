{"id":"332239133_QoS_Prediction_for_Service_Recommendation_with_Deep_Feature_Learning_in_Edge_Computing_Environment","abstract":"Along with the popularity of intelligent services and mobile services, service recommendation has become a key task, especially the task based on quality-of-service (QoS) in edge computing environment. Most existing service recommendation methods have some serious defects, and cannot be directly adopted in edge computing environment. For example, most of existing methods cannot learn deep features of users or services, but in edge computing environment, there are a variety of devices with different configurations and different functions, and it is necessary to learn deep features behind those complex devices. In order to fully utilize hidden features, this paper proposes a new matrix factorization (MF) model with deep features learning, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed mode is named Joint CNN-MF (JCM). JCM is capable of using the learned deep latent features of neighbors to infer the features of a user or a service. Meanwhile, to improve the accuracy of neighbors selection, the proposed model contains a novel similarity computation method. CNN learns the neighbors features, forms a feature matrix and infers the features of the target user or target service. We conducted experiments on a real-world service dataset under a batch of cases of data densities, to reflect the complex invocation cases in edge computing environment. The experimental results verify that compared to counterpart methods, our method can consistently achieve higher QoS prediction results.","authors":["Yuyu Yin","Lu Chen","Yueshen Xu","Jian Wan"],"meta":["April 2020Mobile Networks and Applications 25(1):1-11","DOI:10.1007/s11036-019-01241-7"],"references":["329112824_A_Density-Based_Offloading_Strategy_for_IoT_Devices_in_Edge_Computing_Systems","321531953_Points-of-interest_recommendation_based_on_convolution_matrix_factorization","327787725_Composition-Driven_IoT_Service_Provisioning_in_Distributed_Edges","327617959_Multi-Objective_Optimization_for_Location_Prediction_of_Mobile_Devices_in_Sensor-Based_Applications","327451333_Applying_Probabilistic_Model_Checking_to_Financial_Production_Risk_Evaluation_and_Control_A_Case_Study_of_Alibaba's_Yu'e_Bao","323889200_Reliability_prediction_and_QoS_selection_for_web_service_composition","323562818_Reliability_prediction_and_QoS_selection_for_web_service_composition","322323031_Leveraging_Content_Sensitiveness_and_User_Trustworthiness_to_Recommend_Fine-Grained_Privacy_Settings_for_Social_Image_Sharing","320630978_QoS_prediction_for_service_recommendations_in_mobile_edge_computing","320185178_Your_Neighbors_Alleviate_Cold-start_On_Geographical_Neighborhood_Influence_to_Collaborative_Web_Service_QoS_Prediction","319277488_3D_Convolutional_Networks_for_Session-based_Recommendation_with_Content_Features","319637524_A_Location_and_Reputation_Aware_Matrix_Factorization_Approach_for_Personalized_Quality_of_Service_Prediction","319603294_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_Model_based_on_Convolutional_Denoising_Auto_Encoder","319119947_Multi-Task_Autoencoder_Model_for_Recovering_Human_Poses","318998071_An_SVM-based_collaborative_filtering_approach_for_Top-N_web_services_recommendation"]}
