{"id":"282790268_Statistical_Analysis_of_Persistence_Intensity_Functions","abstract":"Persistence diagrams are two-dimensional plots that summarize the topological\nfeatures of functions and are an important part of topological data analysis. A\nproblem that has received much attention is how deal with sets of persistence\ndiagrams. How do we summarize them, average them or cluster them? One approach\n-- the persistence intensity function -- was introduced informally by\nEdelsbrunner, Ivanov, and Karasev (2012). Here we provide a modification and\nformalization of this approach. Using the persistence intensity function, we\ncan visualize multiple diagrams, perform clustering and conduct two-sample\ntests.","authors":["Yen-Chi Chen","Daren Wang","Alessandro Rinaldo","Larry Wasserman"],"meta":["October 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["328301196_Current_Open_Problems_in_Discrete_and_Computational_Geometry","312592821_Persistent_holes_in_the_Universe_A_hierarchical_topology_of_the_Cosmic_Mass_Distribution","280329789_Persistence_Images_An_Alternative_Persistent_Homology_Representation","269998020_A_Stable_Multi-Scale_Kernel_for_Topological_Machine_Learning","269997854_Robust_Topological_Inference_Distance_To_a_Measure_and_Kernel_Distance","259044443_Stochastic_Convergence_of_Persistence_Landscapes_and_Silhouettes","307534542_Algorithm_AS_136_A_K-means_vlustering_algorithm","281766106_Statistical_topological_data_analysis_using_persistence_landscapes","266920477_Simplicial_Models_and_Topological_Inference_in_Biological_Systems","266003736_Introduction_to_Nonparametric_Estimation"]}
