{"id":"331991817_Requirements_Monitoring_and_Diagnosis_for_Improving_Adaptive_E-Learning_Systems_Design","abstract":"In this paper, we highlight the need to monitor and diagnose adaptive e-learning systems requirements at runtime to develop a better understanding of their behavior during learning activities and improve their design. Our focus is to reveal which learning requirements the adaptive system is satisfying while still evolving and to provide specific recommendations regarding what actions should be taken and which relevant features are needed to help meet the specified learning requirements.","authors":["Lamiae Dounas","Camille Salinesi","Omar El Beqqali"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Information Technology Education:Research 18","DOI:10.28945/4270","Project: Runtime monitoring"],"references":["300046390_Learner_Control_Versus_Computer_Control_in_a_Professional_Training_Context","288629850_Continuous_Monitoring_of_Adaptive_e-learning_Systems_Requirements","271211944_Constructing_Interpretative_Views_of_Learners'_Interaction_Behavior_in_an_Open_Learner_Model","254008880_Kieker_A_framework_for_application_performance_monitoring_and_dynamic_software_analysis","228368749_Detecting_the_Moment_of_Learning","226415062_Specifying_and_Analyzing_Early_Requirements_in_Tropos","307556303_Requirements_Monitoring_Frameworks_A_Systematic_Review","261039636_Self-Explanation_in_Adaptive_Systems","232516960_Self-regulated_learning_and_academic_achievement_Theory_research_and_practice_Springer_series_in_cognitive_development","224282070_Intelligent_and_Adaptive_Learning_Systems_Technology_Enhanced_Support_for_Learners_and_Teachers","222020078_CourseVis_A_graphical_student_monitoring_tool_for_supporting_instructors_in_web-based_distance_courses","221413291_ELM-ART_An_intelligent_tutoring_system_on_world_wide_web","224083533_A_Roadmap_for_Comprehensive_Requirements_Modeling","221552308_Requirements_Tracing_to_Support_Change_in_Dynamically_Adaptive_Systems","221222055_Monitoring_Web_Service_Requirements"]}
