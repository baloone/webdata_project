{"id":"336542391_Enhancing_Deep_Learning_with_Semantics_an_application_to_manufacturing_time_series_analysis","abstract":"Manufacturing enterprises are engaged in implementing new technologies to enhance their manufacturing lines in a smart way. These new technologies give manufacturing enterprises the knowledge, understanding, insight and foresight to improve products, processes and decisions, thereby creating a competitive advantage. In this paper, we explore the use of semantics to enhance deep learning models. We propose an ontology-based LSTM neural network, in which the deep architecture is designed with an ontology to extract high-level cognitive features and stacked LSTM layers for learning temporal dependencies. Our model is applied to a real manufacturing data set with multivariate time series for classification problems. The experiments show that our model can improve performance compared with conventional methods.","authors":["Xin Huang","Cecilia Zanni-Merk","Bruno Cr√©milleux"],"meta":["January 2019Procedia Computer Science 159:437-446","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.198"],"references":["318134519_Predictive_Business_Process_Monitoring_with_LSTM_Neural_Networks","308412408_Imbalanced-learn_A_Python_Toolbox_to_Tackle_the_Curse_of_Imbalanced_Datasets_in_Machine_Learning","305909634_Ontology-Based_Deep_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine","304782562_Long_Short_Term_Memory_Networks_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_Time_Series","304758073_LSTM-based_Encoder-Decoder_for_Multi-sensor_Anomaly_Detection","303250835_Time_series_classification_using_multi-channels_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","291172413_Deep_Convolutional_and_LSTM_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Multimodal_Wearable_Activity_Recognition","320367743_Time_Series_Classification_using_Deep_Learning_for_Process_Planning_A_Case_from_the_Process_Industry","317248421_Deep_Learning_for_Ontology_Reasoning","306097595_Ontology-based_Deep_Learning_for_Human_Behavior_Prediction_with_Explanations_in_Health_Social_Networks_Information_Sciences_-_IF_4832"]}
