{"id":"349485864_Application_of_Newton's_Backward_Interpolation_Using_Wolfram_Mathematica","abstract":"Interpolation is one of the most basic and most useful numerical techniques. It constitutes an irreplaceable tool during work with tabular or graphical functions. The Newton's backward interpolation is one of most important numerical techniques which have huge application in mathematics, computer science and technical science. This paper provides an analytical description of Newton's backward interpolation and how Wolfram Mathematica software can be used to solve the problems from Newton's backward interpolation.","authors":["Zoran Trifunov","Liridon Zenku","Teuta Jusufi Zenku"],"meta":["February 2021International Journal of Mathematics Trends and Technology 67(2):53-56","DOI:10.14445/22315373/IJMTT-V67I2P508"],"references":["344484334_Introduction_of_discrete_and_continuous_random_variable","323890303_HYPERTEXT_ON_LAPLACE_TRANSFORM_USING_WOLFRAM_MATHEMATICA","322937169_Backward_Divided_Difference_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322797649_Newton's_Backward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","319186154_Constructing_and_Exploring_Triangles_with_GeoGebra"]}
