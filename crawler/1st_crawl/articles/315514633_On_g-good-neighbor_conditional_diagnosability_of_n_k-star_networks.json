{"id":"315514633_On_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n_k-star_networks","abstract":"The $g$-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability is a new measure for fault diagnosis of systems. Xu et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci. 659 (2017) 53--63] determined the $g$-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability of $(n, k)$-star networks $S_{n, k}$ (i.e., $t_g(S_{n, k})$) with $1\\leq k\\leq n-1$ for $1\\leq g\\leq n-k$ under the PMC model and the MM$^*$ model. In this paper, we determine $t_g(S_{n, k})$ for all the remaining cases with $1\\leq k\\leq n-1$ for $1\\leq g\\leq n-1$ under the two models, from which we can obtain the $g$-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability of the star graph obtained by Li et al. [to appear in Theor. Comput. Sci.] for $1\\leq g\\leq n-2$.","authors":["Yulong Wei","Min Xu"],"meta":["March 2017Theoretical Computer Science 697(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.07.031"],"references":["284142960_A_comparison_connection_assignment_for_self-diagnosis_of_multiprocessor_systems","273523144_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model_and_MM_Model","224078915_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Matching_Composition_Networks_Under_the_PMC_Model","220771266_A_Comparison_Connection_Assignment_for_Diagnosis_of_Multiprocessor_Systems","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","319259354_On_fault_tolerance_of_n_k_-star_networks","314124704_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_star_graphs_under_the_PMC_and_MM_model","313893268_Conditional_diagnosability_of_a_class_of_matching_composition_networks_under_the_comparison_model","310786338_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Diagnosability_of_nk-star_Graphs","307519130_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","305485422_The_-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Arrangement_Graphs","301908101_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_nk-Star_Graphs_under_the_PMC_Model","301248292_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","299344525_The_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","295254875_G-Good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_3-ary_n-cube_networks","284122852_Length_Two_Path_Centered_Surface_Areas_of_the_n_k-Star_Graph","273475350_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_-Star_Networks_Under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","273394862_Structural_Properties_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Star_Graphs_by_Using_the_PMC_Model","260411228_Generalized_measures_for_fault_tolerance_of_star_networks","256936364_The_conditional_fault_diagnosability_of_n_k-star_graphs","256721346_Conditional_diagnosability_of_matching_composition_networks_under_the_MM_model","256720578_On_deriving_conditional_diagnosability_of_interconnection_networks","224097531_Diagnosability_of_Two-Matching_Composition_Networks_under_the_MM_Model","222679555_On_conditional_diagnosability_of_the_folded_hypercubes","221132175_The_Diagnosability_of_g-good-neighbor_Conditional-Faulty_Hypercube_under_PMC_Model","220358508_On_conditional_diagnosability_and_reliability_of_the_BC_networks","220339827_Conditional_diagnosability_of_hypercubes_under_the_comparison_diagnosis_model","220331120_tk-Diagnosis_for_Component-Composition_Graphs_under_the_MM_Model","220329229_A_Group-Theoretic_Model_for_Symmetric_Interconnection_Networks","220327733_Strongly_Diagnosable_Systems_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","220112540_The_n_k-Star_Graph_A_Generalized_Star_Graph","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3049628_Strongly_Diagnosable_Product_Networks_Under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","3048452_An_0n25_Fault_Identification_Algorithm_for_Diagnosable_Systems","3043034_On_Self-Diagnosable_Multiprocessor_Systems_Diagnosis_by_the_Comparison_Approach"]}
