{"id":"314249149_The_Structure_and_Citation_Landscape_of_IEEE_Transactions_on_Fuzzy_Systems_1994-2015","abstract":"The IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems (TFS) is a reputable international journal in the research domain of computer science and engineering. This study surveys the TFS publications between 1994 and 2015 which are indexed in Web of Sciences (WoS). The purpose is to present a comprehensive overview of the main influencing factors that affect the journal and identify the theme and citation structures of TFS. First of all, the publication and general citation structure of the journal as well as the most cited articles are analyzed. Then, the TFS authorship and co-authorship are well investigated, the maps of author co-citation network and representative sub-network of the TFS co-authorship are presented. Next, this study gives a global overview of TFS publications. The most influential and productive countries/territories as well as the temporal analysis of the leading countries/territories are presented. Finally, the co-citation network for exploring the ground-breaking research is generated and the main co-citation clusters of TFS publications are discovered.","authors":["Zeshui Xu","Dejian Yu","Yuhsuan Kao","Chin-Teng Lin"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2672732"],"references":["260708845_Adaptive_Sliding-Mode_Control_for_Nonlinear_Active_Suspension_Vehicle_Systems_Using_T-S_Fuzzy_Approach","260622223_A_Novel_Control_Design_on_Discrete-Time_Takagi-Sugeno_Fuzzy_Systems_With_Time-Varying_Delays"]}
