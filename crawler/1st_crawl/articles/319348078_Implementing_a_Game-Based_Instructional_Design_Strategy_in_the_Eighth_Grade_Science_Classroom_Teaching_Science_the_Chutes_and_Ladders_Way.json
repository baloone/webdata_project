The authors investigated if science content can be designed and successfully delivered instructionally using a game-like learning environment. The authors also wanted to investigate if by utilizing a game-design method could class and student engagement be increased. The results indicated that the instructional design of the unit using a game-like environment was successful and students exhibited learning. The authors also address the challenges inherent in utilizing this instructional strategy.","authors":["Angela Dowling","Terence C Ahern"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.4018/978-1-5225-2584-4.ch014","In book: Student Engagement and Participation (pp.289-305)","Project: Game-based Curriculum Design"],"references":["308201935_Learning_by_Design_Engineering_the_Learned_State","263063269_Learning_from_Games_Seven_Principles_of_Effective_Design","261669878_Design-Based_Research_Methods_for_Studying_Learning_in_Context_Introduction","243781058_Instructional_Design_Theories_and_Models_Vol_I_An_Overview_of_Their_Current_Status_17","232570858_Does_Discovery-Based_Instruction_Enhance_Learning","232542083_Practicing_Versus_Inventing_With_Contrasting_Cases_The_Effects_of_Telling_First_on_Learning_and_Transfer","224088660_Bridging_the_gap_Cognitive_scaffolding_to_improve_computer_programming_for_middle_school_teachers","303162625_A_world_of_difference_Classrooms_abroad_provide_lessons_in_teaching_math_and_science","281885031_Moving_learning_games_forward","239979310_Evolution_learning_and_culture_Computational_metaphors_for_adaptive_algorithms","238687478_Making_learning_fun_A_taxonomy_of_intrinsic_motivations_for_learning","233073320_Design_Experiments_Theoretical_and_Methodological_Challenges_in_Creating_Complex_Interventions_in_Classroom_Settings","232597223_The_Subgoal_Learning_Model_Creating_Better_Examples_so_That_Students_Can_Solve_Novel_Problems","232596180_Classrooms_Goals_Structures_and_Student_Motivation","225693082_A_critical_review_of_elaboration_theory"]}
