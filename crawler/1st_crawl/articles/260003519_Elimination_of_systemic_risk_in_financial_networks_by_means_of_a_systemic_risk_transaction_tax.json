{"id":"260003519_Elimination_of_systemic_risk_in_financial_networks_by_means_of_a_systemic_risk_transaction_tax","abstract":"Financial markets are exposed to systemic risk (SR), the risk that a major\nfraction of the system ceases to function and collapses. Since recently it is\npossible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes\nrepresent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of\nassets (loans), liabilities, and other obligations such as derivatives. In\nparticular it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual nodes\ncontribute to the overall SR in the financial system. We extend the notion of\nnode-specific SR to individual liabilities in a financial network\n(liability-specific SR). We use historical, empirical data of interbank\nliabilities to show that a few liabilities in a nation-wide interbank network\ncontribute to the major fraction of the overall SR. We propose a tax on\nindividual transactions that is proportional to their contribution to overall\nSR. If a transaction does not increase SR it is tax free. We use a\nmacroeconomic agent based model (CRISIS macro-financial model) with a financial\neconomy to demonstrate that the proposed Systemic Risk Tax (SRT) leads to a\nself-organized re-structuring of financial networks, that are practically free\nof SR. This is because risk-increasing transactions will be systematically\navoided when a SRT is in place. Systemic stability under a SRT emerges due to a\nde facto elimination of system-wide cascading failure. ABM predictions agree\nremarkably well with the empirical data and can be used to understand the\nrelation of credit risk and systemic risk.","authors":["Sebastian Poledna","Stefan Thurner"],"meta":["January 2014Quantitative Finance 16(10)","DOI:10.1080/14697688.2016.1156146","SourcearXiv"],"references":["329268628_Prologue_A_Bird's-Eye_View_The_Financial_Crisis_of_2007-2009_Causes_and_Remedies","287293254_Emergent_macroeconomics_An_Agent-Based_Approach_to_Business_Fluctuations","263352341_Reduction_of_Systemic_Risk_by_Means_of_Pigouvian_Taxation","258328647_Operationalizing_a_macro-prudential_regime_goals_tools_and_open_issues","257073897_Default_Cascades_in_Complex_Networks_Topology_and_Systemic_Risk","257004831_'Too_interconnected_to_fail'_financial_network_of_US_CDS_market_Topological_fragility_and_systemic_risk","236948795_DebtRank-transparency_Controlling_systemic_risk_in_financial_networks","235406706_Cascading_Failures_in_Bi-partite_Graphs_Model_for_Systemic_Risk_Propagation","234090359_Bankruptcy_Cascades_in_Interbank_Markets","230597845_DebtRank_Too_Central_to_Fail_Financial_Networks_the_FED_and_Systemic_Risk","228232087_Volatility_Correlation_and_Tails_for_Systemic_Risk_Measurement","227646211_The_Tobin_Tax_A_Review_of_the_Evidence","226641913_Systemic_Risk_in_Financial_Systems","225762868_Systemic_Risk_Contributions","49768618_Systemic_Risk_in_Banking_Ecosystems","314897847_The_Leverage_Cycle","314570289_Banking_Crises_and_Financial_Integration","314450652_Tipping_Points_in_Macroeconomic_Agent-Based_Models","285919226_Credit_Risk_Pricing_Measurement_and_Management","272688172_Does_Financial_Connectedness_Predict_Crises","272548007_Does_Financial_Connectedness_Predict_Crises","267061297_Macroeconomics_from_the_Bottom-up","266973021_Overlapping_portfolios_contagion_and_financial_stability","264006291_Financial_regulations_and_bank_credit_to_the_real_economy","263723715_Too_Big_to_Be_Efficient_The_Impact_of_Implicit_Subsidies_on_Estimates_of_Scale_Economies_for_Banks","260605282_To_bail-out_or_to_bail-in_Answers_from_an_agent-based_model","259782211_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Mexican_Banking_System's_Network_and_its_Implications_for_Systemic_Risk","257574717_Security_transaction_taxes_Issues_and_evidence","257492753_Financial_contagion_Extending_the_exposures_network_of_the_Mexican_financial_system","250613484_Tipping_points_in_macroeconomic_Agent-Based_models","248297674_Valuing_Credit_Default_Swaps_I","243780797_Options_Futures_and_Other_Derivatives","241759537_Basel_III_ans_Systemic_Risk_Regulation_-_What_Way_Forward","235008914_Leverage-induced_systemic_risk_under_Basle_II_and_other_credit_riskpolicies","228231641_Liaisons_Dangereuses_Increasing_Connectivity_Risk_Sharing_and_Systemic_Risk","228135541_Network_Structure_and_Systemic_Risk_in_Banking_Systems","228125754_Basel_I_Basel_II_and_Emerging_Markets_A_Nontechnical_Analysis","227346064_Market_Liquidity_and_Funding_Liquidity","226464717_When_Financial_Markets_Work_Too_Well_A_Cautious_Case_For_a_Securities_Transactions_Tax","225885788_Network_and_eigenvalue_analysis_of_financial_transaction_networks","222682309_The_Topology_of_Interbank_Payment_Flows","222655435_The_Topology_of_the_Federal_Funds_Market","222654347_Liquidity_and_Leverage","222408876_A_Network_Analysis_of_the_Italian_Overnight_Money_Market","46537252_Business_Fluctuations_and_Bankruptcy_Avalanches_in_an_Evolving_Network","46466994_Econometric_Measures_of_Systemic_Risk_in_the_Finance_and_Insurance_Sectors","46461368_Leverage_Causes_Fat_Tails_and_Clustered_Volatility","46452065_Measuring_Systemic_Risk","41210808_Leverage_Causes_Fat_Tails_and_Clustered_Volatility","24357901_Fluctuations_in_interbank_network_dynamics","23536238_Adaptive_Microfoundations_for_Emergent_Macroeconomics","7888174_The_architecture_of_complex_weighted_networks","4888720_Systemic_Risk_A_Survey","5221034_A_Proposal_for_International_Monetary_Reform","4865296_Estimating_Bilateral_Exposures_in_the_German_Interbank_Market_Is_There_a_Danger_of_Contagion"]}
