{"id":"291951355_On-line_Stator_Inter-turn_Short_Circuits_Monitoring_in_the_DFOC_Induction_Motor_Drive","abstract":"This paper deals with monitoring of interturn short circuits of induction-motor (IM) stator windings operating under the direct field-oriented control (DFOC). Time transients are presented to illustrate the performance of the field-oriented speed control under the stator-winding damage. Novel detection algorithm is introduced, based on an analysis of the internal signals from the control structure: controller outputs and control path decoupling variables. The spectral analysis of these signals is used to detect the stator-winding incipient damages. Significant changes of the constant component ${f}-{{dc}}$ and the double-fundamental harmonic component $\\text{2}{f}-{s}$ observed in these signals' spectra under the stator-winding failure become the basis for the failure diagnostics in various operating conditions of the DFOC IM drive. The superiority of the proposed detection algorithm over the classical motor current signature analysis (MCSA) method is described. The online monitoring process is shown. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed detection algorithm.","authors":["Marcin Wolkiewicz","Grzegorz Tarcha≈Ça","Teresa Orlowska-Kowalska","C.T.
