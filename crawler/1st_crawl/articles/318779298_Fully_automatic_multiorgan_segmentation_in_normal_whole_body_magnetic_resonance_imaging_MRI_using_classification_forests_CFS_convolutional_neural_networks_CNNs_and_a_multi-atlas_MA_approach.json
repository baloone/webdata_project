We examined data from 51 healthy volunteers, scanned prospectively with a standardised, multi-parametric whole body MRI protocol at 1.5T. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and written consent was obtained from the participants. MRI data were used as input data to the algorithms, while training was based on manual annotation of the anatomies of interest by clinical MRI experts. Five-fold cross-validation experiments were run on 34 artefact-free subjects. We report three overlap and three surface distance metrics to evaluate the agreement between the automatic and manual segmentations, namely the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall (RE), precision (PR), average surface distance (ASD), root mean square surface distance (RMSSD) and Hausdorff distance (HD). Analysis of variances was used to compare pooled label metrics between the three algorithms and the DSC on a 'per-organ' basis. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the pooled metrics between CFs and CNNs and the DSC on a 'per-organ' basis, when using different imaging combinations as input for training.\n\nResults: \nAll three algorithms resulted in robust segmenters that were effectively trained using a relatively small number of data sets, an important consideration in the clinical setting. Mean overlap metrics for all the segmented structures were: CFs: DSC=0.70±0.18, RE=0.73±0.18, PR=0.71±0.14, CNNs: DSC=0.81±0.13, RE=0.83±0.14, PR=0.82±0.10, MA: DSC=0.71±0.22, RE=0.70±0.34, PR=0.77±0.15. Mean surface distance metrics for all the segmented structures were: CFs: ASD=13.5±11.3 mm, RMSSD=34.6±37.6 mm and HD=185.7±194.0 mm, CNNs; ASD=5.48±4.84 mm, RMSSD=17.0±13.3 mm and HD=199.0±101.2 mm, MA: ASD=4.22±2.42 mm, RMSSD=6.13±2.55 mm and HD=38.9±28.9 mm. The pooled performance of CFs improved when all imaging combinations (T2w+T1w+DWI) were used as input, while the performance of CNNs deteriorated, but in neither case, significantly. CNNs with T2w images as input, performed significantly better than CFs with all imaging combinations as input for all anatomical labels, except for the bladder.\n\nConclusions: \nThree state-of-the-art algorithms were developed and used to automatically segment major organs and bones in whole body MRI; good agreement to manual segmentations performed by clinical MRI experts was observed. CNNs perform favourably, when using T2w volumes as input. Using multi-modal MRI data as input to CNNs did not improve the segmentation performance. This article is protected by copyright.
