{"id":"222164148_The_asymptotic_average_shadowing_property_and_transitivity","abstract":"We introduce the notion of the asymptotic average shadowing property (Abbrev. AASP) and investigate the relation between the AASP and transitivity. It is shown that a continuous map on X with the AASP is chain transitive and a L-hyperbolic homeomorphism on X with the AASP is topologically transitive, where X is a compact metric space.","authors":["Rongbao Gu"],"meta":["September 2007Nonlinear Analysis 67(6):1680-1689","DOI:10.1016/j.na.2006.07.040"],"references":["235719910_Some_aspects_of_topological_transitivity_-_A_survey","235605725_On_Devaney's_Definition_of_Chaos","38371609_Diffeomorphisms_with_the_Average-Shadowing_Property_on_Two-Dimensional_Closed_Manifolds","279609472_Chapter_15_Topological_Dynamics","269012548_Equicontinuity_and_POTP","267175672_Devaney's_chaos_or_2-scattering_implies_Li-Yorke's_chaos","267144134_On_the_average-shadowing_property","267009276_Topological_dynamics","266215087_Shadowing_in_Dynamical_Systems","265670591_An_Introduction_To_Chaotic_Dynamics_Systems","265374986_On_Intervals_Transitivity_Choas","265367298_An_Introduction_to_Ergodic_Theory","253822655_Small_perturbations_of_chaotic_dynamical_systems","248428483_When_is_a_Transitive_Map_Chaotic","243025188_Recurrence_and_the_asymptotic_pseudo-orbit_tracing_property","238941502_Some_dynamical_properties_of_continuous_semi-flows_having_topological_transitivity","238852427_Shadowing_properties_of_L_-hyperbolic_homeomorphisms","231047822_Sensitive_dependence_on_initial_conditions_Nonlinearity_61067-1075","229356094_The_average-shadowing_property_and_transitivity_for_continuous_flows","225933199_On_the_Nature_of_Turbulence","225385772_Chaos_in_a_topologically_transitive_system","225143056_On_the_pseudo_orbit_tracing_property_and_its_relationship_to_stability","38369433_Interval_maps_factors_of_maps_and_chaos"]}
