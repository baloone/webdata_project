{"id":"324468947_A_Survey_and_an_Analysis_of_Network_Slicing_in_5G_Networks","abstract":"5G networks aim to support a number of vertical industries that are characterized by diverse performance requirements. Network slicing is considered to be the key enabler to enhance cellular networks with the desired flexibility to achieve this target. During the past years, the network slicing concept has been thoroughly studied, and the main operational principles have been established. However, the added complexity introduced by network slicing creates some issues that are still under investigation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of solutions proposed by the research community and, more importantly, the latest status of the 3GPP standardization process. This survey covers solutions for all network domains (i.e., access, transport, and core) as well the management of network slices. The article also identifies key topics that need to be further addressed during the following years.","authors":["Alexandros Kaloxylos"],"meta":["March 2018IEEE Communications Standards Magazine 2(1):60-65","DOI:10.1109/MCOMSTD.2018.1700072"],"references":["313853112_Network_Slicing_to_Enable_Scalability_and_Flexibility_in_5G_Mobile_Networks","301799845_From_Network_Sharing_to_Multi-tenancy_The_5G_Network_Slice_Broker","320261674_NFV_and_SDN_-_Key_Technology_Enablers_for_5G_Networks","318477518_Architecture_modularisation_for_next_generation_mobile_networks","317012410_Network_Slices_Towards_5G_Communications_Slicing_the_LTE_Network","316903300_Network_Slicing_in_5G_Survey_and_Challenges","310436527_5G_Radio_Access_Network_Architecture_Design_Guidelines_and_Key_Considerations","305277242_5G-Crosshaul_An_SDNNFV_control_and_data_plane_architecture_for_the_5G_integrated_FronthaulBackhaul","262287871_SoftRAN_Software_defined_radio_access_network"]}
