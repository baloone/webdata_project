{"id":"236326008_The_Shape_of_Random_Pattern_Avoiding_Permutations","abstract":"We initiate the study of limit shapes for random permutations avoiding a\ngiven pattern. Specifically, for patterns of length 3, we obtain delicate\nresults on the asymptotics of distributions of positions of numbers in the\npermutations. We view the permutations as 0-1 matrices to describe the\nresulting asymptotics geometrically. We then apply our results to obtain a\nnumber of results on distributions of permutation statistics.","authors":["Sam Miner","Igor Pak"],"meta":["March 2013Advances in Applied Mathematics 55(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.aam.2013.12.004","SourcearXiv"],"references":["271052720_The_Catalan_Numbers_Part_II1","230802615_Pattern_Avoidance_in_Matrices","228855121_Restricted_permutations_from_Catalan_to_Fine_and_back","225131967_Refined_Restricted_Permutations","225098701_Expected_Patterns_in_Permutation_Classes","220453462_Properties_of_Random_Triangulations_and_Trees","305976520_A_bernoulli_excursion_and_its_various_applications","303284903_Asymptotics_of_the_Plancherel_measure_of_the_symmetric_group_and_the_limiting_form_of_Young_tables","298537500_Combinatorial_stochastic_processes_-_Saint-Flour_Summer_School_of_Probabilities_XXXII_-_2002","288962391_Interview_with_Professor_Stanley","281022701_Mathematical_Games","281020360_Summary_of_enumeratio_modorum_quibus_figurae_planae_by_IA_de_Segner","272675777_A_combinatorial_problem_in_geometry","268704455_Research_bibliography_of_two_special_number_sequences_Rev_ed","268073649_Surprising_Symmetries_in_Objects_Counted_by_Catalan_Numbers","267661936_Large_Deviations_and_Ratio_Limit_Theorems_for_Pattern-Avoiding_Permutations","267007738_A_Bernoulli_Excursion_and_Its_Various_Applications","266831895_Handbook_of_mathematical_functions_with_formulas_graphs_and_mathematical_tables_Translated_from_the_English_by_V_A_Ditkin_and_L_N_Karmazinaya","265492750_Random_pattern-avoiding_permutations","265328171_Combinatorial_stochastic_processes_Ecole_d'Ete_de_Probabilites_de_Saint-Flour_XXXII_-_2002","262319285_Integer_sequences_online_encyclopedia_of","250956131_On_the_Average_Shape_of_Binary_Trees","248674177_Statistical_mechanics_of_combinatorial_partitions_and_their_limit_configurations","248159570_Triangulating_the_Circle_at_Random","247711307_Ten_Lessons_I_wish_I_Had_Been_Taught","247382239_Statistical_mechanics_of_combinatorial_partitions_and_their_limit_shapes","245340494_Longest_increasing_subsequences_From_patience_sorting_to_the_Baik-Deift-Johansson_theorem","243770699_Asymptotics_of_the_Plancherel_measure_of_the_symmetric_group_and_the_limit_form_of_Young_tableaux","235127121_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","230801553_Counting_Occurrences_of_132_in_a_Permutation","230801367_Restricted_132-Avoiding_Permutations","228455049_THE_NATURE_OF_PARTITION_BIJECTIONS_II_ASYMPTOTIC_STABILITY","227090634_Branching_process_in_the_analysis_of_the_heights_of_trees","225916278_Excursions_in_Brownian_motion","225766020_On_Properties_of_Random_Dissections_and_Triangulations","225549161_The_asymptotic_distribution_of_leaf_heights_in_binary_trees","225135158_On_the_structure_of_linear_graphs","222836318_Bijections_for_refined_restricted_permutations","222577967_Permutations_with_Restricted_Patterns_and_Dyck_Paths","222463436_The_average_height_of_binary_trees_and_other_simple_trees","222460801_Generating_trees_and_the_Catalan_and_Schrder_numbers","220779812_On_properties_of_random_dissections_and_triangulations","220555946_Combinatorics_of_permutations","220345832_On_the_profile_of_random_trees","220189950_Permutations_avoiding_certain_patterns_The_case_of_length_4_and_some_generalizations","51914516_Large_Deviations_for_Non-Crossing_Partitions","40868482_Pattern-avoidance_in_binary_fillings_of_grid_shapes","38362307_Functionals_of_Brownian_Meander_and_Brownian_Excursion","38360866_The_Continuum_Random_Tree_I","38360530_Recursive_Self-Similarity_for_Random_Trees_Random_Triangulations_and_Brownian_Excursion","37598300_Statistics_on_pattern-avoiding_permutations","2924934_Longest_Increasing_Subsequences_in_Pattern-Restricted_Permutations","2853665_The_Nature_Of_Partition_Bijections_I_Involutions","2578173_The_Distribution_of_the_Maximum_Vertex_Degree_in_Random_Planar_Maps","2559708_Analytic_Combinatorics"]}
