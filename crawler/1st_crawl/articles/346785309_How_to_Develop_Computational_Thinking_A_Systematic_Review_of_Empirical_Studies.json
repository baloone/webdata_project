{"id":"346785309_How_to_Develop_Computational_Thinking_A_Systematic_Review_of_Empirical_Studies","abstract":"The primary purpose of this study is to investigate CT skills development process in learning environments. It is also aimed to determine the conceptual understanding and measurement approaches in the studies. To achieve these aims, a systematic research review methodology was implemented as the research design. Empirical studies on computational thinking indexed in the Web of Science and ERIC databases were selected without constraint on the publication dates. The studies found were examined and a pre-analysis was conducted by the researchers. Following the pre-analysis, 29 articles were selected to be included in the study. Content analysis was applied in order to determine and evaluate the common codes and themes related to the findings. In conclusion, instead of relying on attractiveness, functionality, market share of educational tools (robotic sets, software packets etc.), availability of qualified learning activities focused on problem solving is the main point practitioners should consider.","authors":["Elif Taslibeyaz","Engin Kursun","Sel√ßuk Karaman"],"meta":["December 2020Informatics in Education 19(4):701-719","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2020.30"],"references":["321339849_Enhancing_future_K-8_teachers'_computational_thinking_skills_through_modeling_and_simulations","320557926_A_Review_on_the_Opinions_of_Teachers_About_the_Development_of_Computational_Thinking_Skills_in_K-12","319328130_An_Exploration_of_the_Role_of_Visual_Programming_Tools_in_the_Development_of_Young_Children's_Computational_Thinking","318754784_Introducing_Computational_Thinking_to_Young_Learners_Practicing_Computational_Perspectives_Through_Embodiment_in_Mathematics_Education","317618056_Programming_video_games_and_simulations_in_science_education_exploring_computational_thinking_through_code_analysis","317418025_Computational_thinking_as_springboard_for_learning_object-oriented_programming_in_an_interactive_MOOC","313920374_Programlama_Egitiminin_Bilgi_Islemsel_Dusunme_Becerileri_Baglaminda_Incelenmesi","311568775_Effect_of_Robotics_on_Elementary_Preservice_Teachers'_Self-Efficacy_Science_Learning_and_Computational_Thinking","321401670_Block-oriented_programming_with_tangibles_An_engaging_way_to_learn_computational_thinking_skills","314371816_Exploration_on_the_cultivation_of_Computational_Thinking_Ability_in_the_teaching_of_PhotoShop"]}
