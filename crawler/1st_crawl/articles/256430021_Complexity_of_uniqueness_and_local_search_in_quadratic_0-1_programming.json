{"id":"256430021_Complexity_of_uniqueness_and_local_search_in_quadratic_0-1_programming","abstract":"We prove that the problem of checking whether a quadratic 0–1 problem has a unique solution is NP-hard. Furthermore, we prove that finding the global minimum of quadratic 0–1 programming with unique solution remains an NP-hard problem. Regarding local search, we prove that the problem of finding a discrete local minimum for quadratic 0–1 problems, with two coordinates being fixed, is NP-hard. In addition, we discuss an algorithm for computing discrete local minima.","authors":["P. M.
