{"id":"330014991_Factors_Affecting_the_Choice_of_Usability_Evaluation_Methods_for_Interactive_Adaptive_Systems","abstract":"Choosing the appropriate usability evaluation methods is a key part of the usability evaluation process of interactive adaptive systems. This step needs the consideration of different factors, leading to a multi-criteria decision analysis problem. In this paper, we present a review of the main factors reported in the literature which can affect the selection of usability evaluation methods for interactive adaptive systems. Three of the most commonly used usability evaluation methods are selected and classified according to these factors. The results of this research are used by applying a decision aid method in order to guide the choice of suitable usability evaluation methods for a given adaptive system in the field of tourism.","authors":["Amira Dhouib","Ahlem ASSILA","Trabelsi Abdelwaheb","Christophe Kolski"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-05909-5_16","Conference: International Conference on Human-Centred Software EngineeringVolume: 7th IFIP WG 13.2 International Working Conference, HCSE 2018, Sophia Antipolis, France, September 3â€“5, 2018, Revised Selected Papers"],"references":["306072295_Integration_of_Subjective_and_Objective_Usability_Evaluation_Based_on_ISOIEC_15939_A_Case_Study_for_Traffic_Supervision_Systems","305869646_A_classification_and_comparison_of_usability_evaluation_methods_for_interactive_adaptive_systems","242379306_On_Some_Properties_of_Outranking_Relations_Based_on_a_Concordance-Discordance_Principle","228722913_Context_aware_business_adaptation_toward_user_interface_adaptation","221248045_UCD_method_selection_with_usability_planner","220800390_Usability_Engineering_for_the_Adaptive_Web","220302514_State_of_the_Art_on_the_Cognitive_Walkthrough_Method_Its_Variants_and_Evolutions","220116360_Layered_evaluation_of_interactive_adaptive_systems_Framework_and_formative_methods","2484294_Adaptive_Systems_a_solution_to_usability_problems","321616639_Maturing_Usability_Quality_in_Software_Interaction_and_Value","319447333_EvalCHOICE_A_Decision_Support_Approach_for_the_Usability_Evaluation_of_Interactive_Adaptive_Systems","319215920_A_Service-Oriented_Application_Creation_Process_in_Ubiquitous_Environments_Travel_Assistant_Mobile_Application","318873216_Towards_the_Layered_Evaluation_of_Interactive_Adaptive_Systems_using_ELECTRE_TRI_Method","316081372_Weighting_Methods_and_their_Effects_on_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_Model_Outcomes_in_Water_Resources_Management","299822588_The_outranking_approach_and_the_foundations_of_ELECTRE_methods","248590293_A_Practical_Guide_to_Usability_Testing","247695758_Systems_That_Adapt_to_Their_Users","242692558_User-Centered_Software_Evaluation_Methodologies","242501560_Chapter_27_The_Usability_Engineering_Framework_for_Product_Design_and_Evaluation","229068101_Human-Computer_Interaction","224001112_Heuristic_Evaluation","223061736_Review_on_multi-criteria_decision_analysis_aid_in_sustainable_energy_decision-making","38279495_Methodologie_Multicritere_d'Aide_la_Decision","2481064_A_Framework_to_Choose_a_Discrete_Multicriterion_Aggregation_Procedure"]}
