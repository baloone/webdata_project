{"id":"308858221_3D_STREAMING_PROTOCOLS_FOR_SPATIAL_DATA_INFRASTRUCTURE_A_BRIEF_REVIEW","abstract":"Web services utilizations in Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) have been well established and standardized by Open Geospatial 3D graphics rendering has been a topic of interest among scientific domain from both computer science and geospatial science. Different methods were proposed and discussed in these researches for different domains and applications. Each method provides advantages and trade-offs. Some methods proposed image based rendering for 3D graphics and ultimately. This paper attempts to discuss several techniques from past researches and attempts to propose another method inspired from these techniques, customized for 3D SDI its data workflow use cases.","authors":["C.
