{"id":"305544419_Cultivation_of_science_identity_through_authentic_science_in_an_urban_high_school_classroom","abstract":"This study examined how a contextually based authentic science experience affected the science identities of urban high school students who have been marginalized during their K-12 science education. We examined studentsâ€™ perceptions of the intervention as an authentic science experience, how the experience influenced their science identity, as well as their perceptions about who can do science. We found that the students believed the experience to be one of authentic science, that their science identity was positively influenced by participation in the experience, and that they demonstrated a shift in perceptions from stereotypical to more diverse views of scientists. Implications for science education are discussed.","authors":["Angela Chapman","Allan Feldman"],"meta":["June 2017Cultural Studies of Science Education 12(2):1-23","DOI:10.1007/s11422-015-9723-3","Project: Inclusivity in STEM"],"references":["240645820_Is_There_A_Place_for_Me_Role_Models_and_Academic_Identity_among_White_Students_and_Students_of_Color","237088557_The_Relationship_Between_Race_and_Students'_Identified_Career_Role_Models_and_Perceived_Role_Model_Influence","317953395_Qualitative_research_and_evaluation_methods","304496314_Qualitative_research_and_evaluation_methods_London_Sage_Publications","297561134_Teaching_science_with_homeless_children_Pedagogy_representation_and_identity","275780339_Statistical_Applications_for_the_Behavioral_Sciences","266701869_Statistical_Applications_for_The_Behavioural_Sciences","263607724_An_Examination_of_Change_in_Teacher_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_in_Science_Education_Based_on_the_Duration_of_Inservice_Activities","252496365_A_National_Science_Fair_Exhibiting_support_for_the_knowledge_economy","250185374_Chapter_3_Identity_as_an_Analytic_Lens_for_Research_in_Education","229790690_Developing_a_sustained_interest_in_science_among_urban_minority_youth_Journal_of_Research_in_Science_Teaching_443_466-489","234578723_Students_Who_Study_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_STEM_in_Postsecondary_Education_Stats_in_Brief_NCES_2009-161","232599181_Evaluation_of_undergraduate_research_experience_Perceptions_of_undergraduate_interns_and_their_faculty_mentors","230548057_Third_grade_African_American_students'_views_of_the_nature_of_science","229789340_Creating_contextually_authentic_science_in_a_low-performing_urban_elementary_school"]}
