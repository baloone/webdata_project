{"id":"243767082_Squared_Functional_Systems_and_Optimization_Problems","abstract":"In this paper we give an explicit description of the cones of polynomials represent able as a sum of squared functions. We prove that such cones can be always seen as a linear image of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. As a consequence of the result, we get a description of the cones of univariate polynomials, which are non-negative on a ray and on an interval, and a description of non-negative trigonometric polynomials. We discuss some applications of the results to multi-variate polynomials.","authors":["Yurii Nesterov"],"meta":["January 2000","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4757-3216-0_17"],"references":["262247171_Primal-Dual_Interior-Point_Methods_for_Self-Scaled_Cones","239588219_Self-Scaled_Barriers_and_Interior-Point_Methods_for_Convex_Programming","251201539_Verschrfung_des_ersten_Mittelwertsatzes_der_Integralrechnung_fr_rationale_Polynome","242359632_Tchebycheff_Systems_With_Applications_in_Analysis_and_Statistics","230872972_Semi-Infinite_Programming_Theory_Methods_and_Applications","230725447_Interior-point_polynomial_algorithms_in_convex_programming","2497686_FIR_Filter_Design_via_Spectral_Factorization_and_Convex_Optimization"]}
