{"id":"324533809_Participatory_Culture_and_the_Social_Value_of_an_Architectural_Icon_Sydney_Opera_House","abstract":"This book develops new and innovative methods for understanding the cultural significance of places such as the World Heritage listed Sydney Opera House. By connecting participatory media, visual culture and social value, Cristina Garduño Freeman contributes to a fast-growing body of scholarship on digital heritage and the popular reception of architecture. In this, her first book, she opens up a fresh perspective on heritage, as well as the ways in which people relate to architecture via participation on social media. Social media sites such as YouTube, Pinterest, Wikipedia, Facebook and Flickr, as well as others, become places for people to express their connections with places, for example, the Sydney Opera House. Garduño Freeman analyses real-world examples, from souvenirs to opera-house-shaped cakes, and untangles the tangible and intangible ways in which the significance of heritage is created, disseminated and maintained. As people’s encounters with World Heritage become increasingly mediated by the digital sphere there is a growing imperative for academics, professionals and policy-makers to understand the social value of significant places. This book is beneficial to academics, students and professionals of architecture.","authors":["Cristina Garduno Freeman"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.4324/9781315599496","ISBN: 9781315599496"],"references":["240545765_Snapshots_r_us_The_evidentiary_problematic_of_home_media"]}
