{"id":"299383613_New_approximations_of_some_expressions_involving_trigonometric_functions","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to apply a computation method due to Malešević and Makragić (Malešević and Makragić, 2016) for approximating some trigonometric functions. Inequalities of Wilker–Cusa–Huygens are discussed, but the method can be successfully applied to a wide class of problems. In particular, we improve the estimates recently obtained by Mortici (Mortici, 2014) and moreover we show that they hold true also on some extended intervals.","authors":["Marija Nenezic","Branko Malesevic","Cristinel Mortici"],"meta":["June 2016Applied Mathematics and Computation 283:299-315","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2016.02.035"],"references":["287489351_A_proof_of_two_conjectures_of_Chao-Ping_Chen_for_inverse_trigonometric_functions","281740004_A_Method_for_Proving_Some_Inequalities_on_Mixed_Trigonometric_Polynomial_Functions","280050617_Some_Notes_on_a_Method_for_Proving_Inequalities_by_Computer","268161295_The_natural_approach_of_Wilker-Cusa-Huygens_inequalities","220483870_One_Method_for_Proving_Inequalities_by_Computer","284774024_Problem_E3306","284051654_Inequalities_involving_trigonometric_functions","281320823_A_proof_of_two_conjectures_of_Chao-Ping_Chen_for_inverse_trigonometric_functions","281320507_A_Method_of_Proving_a_Class_of_Inequalities_of_Mixed_Real_Trigonometric_Polynomial_Functions","259440798_A_subtly_analysis_of_Wilker_inequality"]}
