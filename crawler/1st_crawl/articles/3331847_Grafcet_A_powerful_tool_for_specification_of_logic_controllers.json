{"id":"3331847_Grafcet_A_powerful_tool_for_specification_of_logic_controllers","abstract":"Basically, a logic controller is a discrete-event system whose\npurpose is to control the behavior of a process which is itself (seen by\nthe controller as) a discrete-event system, taking into account the\nstate of this process and other information coming from an operator or\nfrom other systems. In the early 1970s, the need to describe\nincreasingly complex logic controllers was becoming evident, since the\nprogrammable logic controllers (PLC) were becoming more powerful and\nmore extensively used. This paper shows how Grafcet can be used for this\npurpose. Grafcet is a tool, drawing its inspiration from Petri nets (a\ngeneral purpose mathematical tool allowing various discrete-event\nsystems to be described), whose aim is the specification of logic\ncontrollers. It is the basis of the sequential function chart (SFC), an\nInternational Standard in 1987. This paper, introductory in nature,\nexplains the Grafcet model using the classical-state table model and\npresents a method for interpreting grafcets","authors":["Rene David"],"meta":["October 1995Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on 3(3):253 - 268","DOI:10.1109/87.406973","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["262362141_LUSTRE_a_declarative_language_for_real-time_programming","317726858_Petri_Nets_and_Grafcet_for_Specification_of_Logic_Controllers","300931883_A_PACKAGE_FOR_COMPUTER_DESIGN_OF_CONCURRENT_LOGIC_CONTROL_SYSTEMS","290822026_Design_Recovery_for_Relay_Ladder_Logic","285842809_Petri_Nets_Properties_Analysis_and_Applications","285448170_PROGRAMMABLE_LOGIC_CONTROLLERS_AND_PETRI_NETS_A_COMPARATIVE_STUDY","284430625_Reseaux_de_Petri_interpretes_et_Grafcet","268781349_SIGNAL_A_data_flow_oriented_language_for_real_time_signal_processing","268666403_Extension_du_grafcet_pour_la_representation_de_systemes_temps_reel_complexes","238710945_Petri_Net_Theory_and_Modelling_of_Systems","227025833_On_conditionevent_systems_with_discrete_state_realizations","223625435_Petri_nets_for_modeling_of_dynamic_systems_A_survey","220692434_Petri_Nets_and_Grafcet_-_Tools_for_Modeling_Discrete_Event_Systems","220573291_Analysis_of_Petri_Nets_by_Stepwise_Refinements","3600637_The_supervisory_control_of_the_automated_manufacturing_system_of_the_AIP","3524489_Design_recovery_for_relay_ladder_logic","3177991_SIGNAL_a_data_flow_oriented_language_for_signal_processing","3115662_Asynchronous_Sequential_Switching_Circuit","2984167_Analysis_and_Applications_Proceedings_of_the_IEEE_774_541-580"]}
