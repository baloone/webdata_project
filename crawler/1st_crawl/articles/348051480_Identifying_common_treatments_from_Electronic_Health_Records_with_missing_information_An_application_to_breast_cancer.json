In order to do that, using Electronic Health Records, we define a general methodology that allows us to: ( i ) identify the actions in the health system associated with a disease; ( ii ) identify those patients with a complete treatment for the disease; ( iii ) and discover common treatment pathways followed by the patients with a specific diagnosis. The methodology takes into account the characteristics of the EHRs, such as record heterogeneity and missing information. As an example, we use the proposed methodology to analyze breast cancer disease. For this diagnosis, 5 groups of treatments, which fit in with medical practice guidelines and expert knowledge, were obtained.","authors":["Onintze Zaballa","Aritz Pérez","Elisa Gómez Inhiesto","Teresa Acaiturri Ayesta"],"meta":["December 2020PLoS ONE 15(12):e0244004","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0244004"],"references":["335993680_Faster_k-Medoids_Clustering_Improving_the_PAM_CLARA_and_CLARANS_Algorithms","333633120_Early_breast_cancer_ESMO_Clinical_Practice_Guidelines_for_diagnosis_treatment_and_follow-up","326558204_4th_ESO-ESMO_international_consensus_guidelines_for_advanced_breast_cancer_ABC_4","314092481_Simulation_of_Patients_Flow_in_Healthcare_Multiple_Units_using_Process_and_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Model_Identification","324286003_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","316115808_K-Medoids_Clustering","305696608_Hybrid_Approach_to_the_Generation_of_Medical_Guidelines_for_Insulin_Therapy_for_Children","301643279_Process_Mining_in_Healthcare_A_literature_review","300462289_Data_Driven_Analytics_for_Personalized_Healthcare","282354196_Paving_the_COWPath_Learning_and_Visualizing_Clinical_Pathways_from_Electronic_Health_Record_Data"]}
