{"id":"277145143_Cooperative_Localization_for_Mobile_Agents_A_Recursive_Decentralized_Algorithm_Based_on_Kalman-Filter_Decoupling","abstract":"In this note, we provide an overview of the cooperative localization problem\nfor mobile agents, its applications and some of the challenges involved in\ndesigning decentralized algorithms for it. Then, we present a novel\ndecentralized cooperative localization algorithm that is a decentralized\nimplementation of a centralized Extended Kalman Filter for cooperative\nlocalization. In this algorithm, instead of propagating cross-covariance terms,\neach agent propagates new intermediate local variables that can be used in an\nupdate stage to create the required propagated cross-covariance terms. Whenever\nthere is a relative measurement in the network, the algorithm declares the\nagent making this measurement as the interim master. By acquiring information\nfrom the interim landmark, the agent the relative measurement is taken from,\nthe interim master can calculate and broadcast a set of intermediate variables\nwhich each robot can then use to update its estimates to match that of a\ncentralized Extended Kalman Filter for cooperative localization. Once an update\nis done, no further communication is needed until the next relative\nmeasurement.","authors":["Solmaz Kia","Stephen Rounds","Sonia Mart√≠nez"],"meta":["May 2015IEEE control systems 36(2)","DOI:10.1109/MCS.2015.2512033","SourcearXiv"],"references":["279839582_Decentralized_cooperative_trajectory_estimation_for_autonomous_underwater_vehicles","260305004_Cooperative_Multi-Vehicle_Localization_Using_Split_Covariance_Intersection_Filter","236455572_Cooperative_localization_by_dual_foot-mounted_inertial_sensors_and_inter-agent_ranging","225249608_Observability-based_Consistent_EKF_Estimators_for_Multi-robot_Cooperative_Localization","225244509_A_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Collaborative_Multi-Robot_Localization","224339651_Towards_Environmental_Monitoring_with_Mobile_Robots","221069255_Multi-Robot_Collaboration_for_Robust_Exploration","221066700_A_reciprocal_sampling_algorithm_for_lightweight_distributed_multi-robot_localization","3344127_Gps-less_Low_Cost_Outdoor_Localization_for_Very_Small_Devices","313193835_A_Kalman_filter_model_for_GPS_navigation_of_land_vehicles","290691504_A_centralized-equivalent_decentralized_implementation_of_Extended_Kalman_Filters_for_cooperative_localization","283021268_Cooperative_localization_under_message_dropouts_via_a_partially_decentralized_EKF_scheme","263510534_Cooperative_Inertial_Navigation","261352398_Decentralized_multi-robot_cooperative_localization_using_covariance_intersection","261075356_Data_incest_in_cooperative_localisation_with_the_Common_Past-Invariant_Ensemble_Kalman_filter","242920340_Advances_in_Control_Systems","241462247_Robust_mobile_robot_localization_From_single-robot_uncertainties_to_multi-robot_interdependencies","224669046_Cooperative_positioning_with_multiple_robots","224557592_Consistent_cooperative_localization","224557380_Cooperative_multi-robot_localization_under_communication_constraints","224557191_Distributed_Maximum_A_Posteriori_Estimation_for_Multi-robot_Cooperative_Localization","221071432_Putting_the_'I'_in_'Team'_an_ego-centric_approach_to_cooperative_localization","220396595_Decentralized_Localization_of_Sparsely-Communicating_Robot_Networks_A_Centralized-Equivalent_Approach","3972083_Localization_for_mobile_robot_teams_using_maximum_likelihood_estimation","3930428_Simultaneous_Localisation_and_Map_Building_Using_Split_Covariance_Intersection","3912186_Covariance_Intersection_Algorithm_for_Distributed_Spacecraft_State_Estimation","3709997_Cooperative_search_and_rescue_with_a_team_of_mobile_robots","3608747_A_Kalman_filter_model_for_GPS_navigation_of_land_vehicles","3453971_Urban_search_and_rescue_robots_From_tragedy_to_technology","3450326_Performance_analysis_of_multirobot_Cooperative_localization","3344769_Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping_Part_I","3299280_Distributed_multirobot_localization","3298739_A_Solution_to_the_Simultaneous_Localization_and_Map_Building_SLAM_Problem","3298223_Mobile_robot_localization_by_tracking_geometric_beacons","3236074_Nonparametric_belief_propagation_for_self-localization_of_sensor_networks","2667979_A_Non-Divergent_Estimation_Algorithm_in_the_Presence_of_Unknown_Correlations","2562387_Mobile_Sensor_Network_Deployment_Using_Potential_Fields_A_Distributed_Scalable_Solution_to_the_Area_Coverage_Problem"]}
