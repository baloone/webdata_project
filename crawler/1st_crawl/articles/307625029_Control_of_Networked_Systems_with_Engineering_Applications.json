{"id":"307625029_Control_of_Networked_Systems_with_Engineering_Applications","abstract":"Recently, control of networked systems problems has attracted much attention among researchers in biology, physics, control engineering, and computer science for decades, partially due to the broad applications of control of networked systems in many engineering areas including cooperative control of mobile robots and estimation of mobile sensor networks. The study of complex network topology and modeling is to understand the influence of network structure on its function and consequently to find effective ways to improve network performance.","authors":["Housheng Su","Michael Z.
