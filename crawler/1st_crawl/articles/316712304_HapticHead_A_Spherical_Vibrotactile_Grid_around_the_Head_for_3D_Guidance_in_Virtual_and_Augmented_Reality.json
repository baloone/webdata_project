{"id":"316712304_HapticHead_A_Spherical_Vibrotactile_Grid_around_the_Head_for_3D_Guidance_in_Virtual_and_Augmented_Reality","abstract":"Current virtual and augmented reality head-mounted displays usually include no or only a single vibration motor for haptic feedback and do not use it for guidance. We present HapticHead, a system utilizing multiple vibrotactile actuators distributed in three concentric ellipses around the head for intuitive haptic guidance through moving tactile cues. We conducted three experiments, which indicate that HapticHead vibrotactile feedback is both faster (2.6 s vs. 6.9 s) and more precise (96.4% vs. 54.2% success rate) than spatial audio (generic head-related transfer function) for finding visible virtual objects in 3D space around the user. The baseline of visual feedback is as expected more precise (99.7% success rate) and faster (1.3 s) in comparison, but there are many applications in which visual feedback is not desirable or available due to lighting conditions, visual overload, or visual impairments. Mean final precision with HapticHead feedback on invisible targets is 2.3° compared to 0.8° with visual feedback. We successfully navigated blindfolded users to real household items at different heights using HapticHead vibrotactile feedback independently of a head-mounted display.","authors":["Oliver Beren Kaul","Michael Rohs"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1145/3025453.3025684","Conference: the 2017 CHI Conference","Project: HapticHead - a Vibrotactile Interface around the Head"],"references":["310595349_Augmenting_spatial_awareness_with_haptic_radar","281781033_ProximityHat_-_A_Head-Worn_System_for_Subtle_Sensory_Augmentation_with_Tactile_Stimulation","280089423_Centralizing_Bias_and_the_Vibrotactile_Funneling_Illusion_on_the_Forehead","278303041_Exploring_Vibrotactile_Feedback_on_the_Body_and_Foot_for_the_Purpose_of_Pedestrian_Navigation","305214452_Head-Mounted_Sensory_Augmentation_Device_Comparing_Haptic_and_Audio_Modality","302074193_HapticHead_3D_Guidance_and_Target_Acquisition_through_a_Vibrotactile_Grid","301462155_Tactile_Animation_by_Direct_Manipulation_of_Grid_Displays","293637200_Auditory_Adaptation_to_Non-Individual_HRTF_Cues_in_Binaural_Audio_Reproduction","292546126_Binaural_technique_Do_we_need_individual_recordings","281148220_Interactive_spatial_sonification_for_non-visual_exploration_of_virtual_maps"]}
