{"id":"319963340_Modify_the_mCS-51_Architecture_to_SIMD_VLIW_and_Superscalar_mC","abstract":"Computer architects have always strived to increase the\nperformance of general purpose computers and special\nfunctional CPUs. The high performance may depend on the\nhardware chips manufacturing, however this trend has\nconstrains, because there are limits of the physical technology,\nthe other trend to increase the performance depend on the\nparallelism (multiple-processing). Recently the superscalar\nprocessing is the latest up-to-date technique of innovations\naimed for producing ever-faster microprocessors, they are\ncapable of executing more than one instruction in one clock\ncycle, in addition to perform multiple independent operations\nsimultaneously.\nIn this paper we modify the architecture of the conventional\nmicrocontroller (μC-51) using VHDL, also we develop some\ninnovated special programmed instructions which utilize\nparallelism (via multiple processing units). Thus we present a\nmodified superscalar processor using single instruction multiple\ndata (SIMD) with very long instruction word (VLIW)\narchitectures. The proposed modified microcontroller (MμC)\nhas impact in reducing number of clock cycles per instruction,\nimprovement of overall μC performance, and increasing\ntransmission/reception data rate of the μC serial/parallel ports.","authors":["Assem Badr"],"meta":["January 2012"],"references":["253858499_Architecture_of_SIMD_Type_Vector_Processor","315495174_Fiber_Optics_Standard_Dictionary","264925367_Computer_organization_design_and_architecture_4th_ed","228607737_High-Level_Modeling_and_FPGA_Prototyping_of_Microprocessors_Joydeep_Ray","3215549_IPC_Considered_Harmful_for_Multiprocessor_Workloads"]}
