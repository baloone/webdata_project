{"id":"325630411_Switching_from_Traditional_to_Blended_Learning_at_University_Level_Students'_and_Lecturers'_Experiences","abstract":"This research paper is a reflective account of the implementation of blended learning in terms of the principles and mechanics employed and what it meant for students and lecturers who participated in the course. The process included gathering research evidence, seeking departmental approval, changing the curriculum, experimenting with digital media, specifically; voice overs and video technology; integrating student feedback and interaction and monitoring student learning and accessibility. From the students\" perspectives, there was need for greater self-regulation and accountability for covering online material and utilizing online resources in meaningful ways. The research also examined the patterns of access that students utilized (e.g. the days, times and duration with online content, the methods they employed, etc.). The findings revealed that lecturers developed many creative approaches to facilitate online learning using various media. There was also need for much reflective thought and critical thinking in developing the online content especially in terms of integrating post-online dialogue in the face-to-face environment. Overall, this initial foray into blended learning at this university department revealed critical principles and mechanics which were instrumental to the success of the new strategy. The implications of these findings were further explicated.","authors":["W.
