{"id":"322276565_A_Study_on_Regularity_in_Vague_Graphs","abstract":"Theoretical concepts of graphs are highly utilized by computer\nscientists.Especially in research areas of computer science such as data mining,\nimage segmentation, clustering image capturing and networking. The vague\ngraphs are more flexible and compatible than fuzzy graphs due to the fact that\nthey allowed the degree of membership of a vertex to an edge to be represented\nby interval valued in [0,1] rather than the crisp real values between 0 and 1. In\nthis paper, some interesting properties of an edge regular vague graph are given.\nAlso, new concepts such as strongly regular, edge regular, and biregular vague\ngraphs are defined.","authors":["Hossein Rashmanlou","Mostafa Nouri"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.22457/pindac.v5n2a2","Project: Generalization of fuzzy graphs"],"references":["322593939_EDGE_REGULAR_INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_GRAPH","301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","285580973_New_Concepts_of_Vague_Graphs","281399313_Degree_of_vertices_in_vague_graphs","292143739_Product_of_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_and_their_degree","292004369_Similar_relations_and_fuzzy_ordering","288869566_Is_there_a_need_for_fuzzy_logic","287711963_Fuzzy_sets_information_and_control","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","282765879_More_Results_on_Vague_Graphs","280067009_Complete_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","280066549_Some_Properties_of_Highly_Irregular_Interval_Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","280066105_Balanced_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties"]}
