{"id":"261473819_Validity_and_Reliability_in_Social_Science_Research","abstract":"This article provides an historical account of how fee -charging Victorian schools have marketed themselves over the past 150 years( via the use of advertisements, brochures, and prospectuses) in order to promote those aspects of schooling believed to be of most importance to potential customers (parents).
