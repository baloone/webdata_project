{"id":"263894975_A_method_for_computing_curved_meshes_via_the_linear_elasticity_analogy","abstract":"We propose and analyze an algorithm for the robust construction of curved meshes in two and three dimensions. The meshes are made of curved simplexes. The algorithm starts from a mesh made of straight simplexes, and using a linear elasticity analogy applied on well-chosen data, one can generate a curved mesh. Note that if the initial mesh has a boundary layer, this method allows to conserve it on the final mesh. This algorithm is used on several airfoils in two and three dimensions, including a turbulent M6 wing.
