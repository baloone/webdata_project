{"id":"245225738_Current_Status_in_and_Future_Trends_of_Ultraprecision_Machining_and_Ultrafine_Materials_Processing","abstract":"The historical progress of machining accuracy is plotted and its probable further development is shown by extrapolation, both in the micro-technology and nano-technology regions. Single point “mirror machining” of soft metals and the ultraprecision polishing of hard and brittle materials are discussed. The concept of “atomic-bit” chip removal first by elastic emission machining, etc. is introduced. Photolithography for LSI wafer processing and electron beam processing/lithography for IC photo masks are then described. Ion beam sputtering, a promising atomic-bit machining process for the near future, is also described. Finally, analysis is made of the problems to be addressed and solved in achieving true accuracies of 0.1 μm - 0.05 μm for electronic, optical and mechanical workpieces; measuring resolution and random errors in the required ultra-precision processing machines will have to be no worse than 0.01 μm (10 nm).","authors":["Norio Taniguchi"],"meta":["December 1983CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology 32(2):573-582","DOI:10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60185-1"],"references":["284818881_Analysis_of_mechanism_of_various_materials_working_based_on_the_concept_of_working_energy"]}
