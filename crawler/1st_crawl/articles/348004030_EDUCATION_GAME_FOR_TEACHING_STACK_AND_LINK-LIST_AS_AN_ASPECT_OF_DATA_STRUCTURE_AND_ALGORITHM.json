{"id":"348004030_EDUCATION_GAME_FOR_TEACHING_STACK_AND_LINK-LIST_AS_AN_ASPECT_OF_DATA_STRUCTURE_AND_ALGORITHM","abstract":"This project focused on designing educational games for teaching stack and link-list which are the most challenging and difficult aspect of Data structure and Algorithm. Due to the nature of the course, and from research findings, it was observed that most students find it difficult to understand stack and linked list despite the effort of the lecturer. Therefore, the introduction of this educational game will enable the student to learn fast and understand the major content of the course. This application was developed to eradicate the abstractness of teaching stack and link-list and make the learning an interactive one, it is application software that can be installed java mobile environment for the use of students most especially those in the higher institutions. This application can be installed in a JAVA environment just like any other app and can be updated from time to time which makes the application accessible on the mobile device for students. It's also help in the simplification of the teaching of stack and link-list in tertiary institutions most especially for Computer Science students.","authors":["O T Olanrewaju","A A Adegbile","A O Ogunbade","T O Dada"],"meta":["July 2018International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 16(7):151","Project: Mobile App"],"references":["228659206_Game_inspired_tool_support_for_e-learning_processes","222399548_Educational_game_design_for_online_education","23266832_Playing_linear_numerical_board_games_promotes_low-income_children's_numerical_development","273130022_Incremental_Learning_or_The_Importance_of_Starting_Small"]}
