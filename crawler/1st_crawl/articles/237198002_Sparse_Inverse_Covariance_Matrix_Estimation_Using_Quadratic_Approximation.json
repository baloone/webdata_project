{"id":"237198002_Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Matrix_Estimation_Using_Quadratic_Approximation","abstract":"The L1-regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has been shown\nto have strong statistical guarantees in recovering a sparse inverse covariance\nmatrix, or alternatively the underlying graph structure of a Gaussian Markov\nRandom Field, from very limited samples. We propose a novel algorithm for\nsolving the resulting optimization problem which is a regularized\nlog-determinant program. In contrast to recent state-of-the-art methods that\nlargely use first order gradient information, our algorithm is based on\nNewton's method and employs a quadratic approximation, but with some\nmodifications that leverage the structure of the sparse Gaussian MLE problem.\nWe show that our method is superlinearly convergent, and present experimental\nresults using synthetic and real-world application data that demonstrate the\nconsiderable improvements in performance of our method when compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Cho-Jui Hsieh","Mátyás A.
