This article describes the advantage of studying the subjective dimension of users’ emotions using an experiential method based on the users describing their experience. A case study portrays the effective use of an audio and video communication instrument for remote mobile interaction. The data obtained from in-depth interviewing (clarification and self-confrontation) and video recording of the activity are analysed in terms of the users’ emotional movements during three interaction sequences. An analysis of these data emphasises the uncomfortable dissymmetry generated by the tool in terms of controlling visual exploration, the difficulty following the unexpected movements of the other person and the off-setting of concurrent emotional states. The paper explores the contribution of experiential methodology in order to study the emergence of affects and their functional role during activity, in relation to the action and the decision.","authors":["Beatrice Cahour","Christian Brassac","Pierre Vermersch","Jean-Léon Bouraoui"],"meta":["January 2007Revue d'Anthropologie des Connaissances 1, 1(1)","DOI:10.3917/rac.001.0085"],"references":["242129675_Conscience_directe_et_conscience_reflechie","346561423_On_Becoming_Aware_A_pragmatics_of_experiencing","308468917_Experiencing_emotion_A_cross-cultural_study","292460510_Linguistic_anthropology_A_reader","284341234_Biases_in_processing_emotional_information","281581979_Enregistrement_en_perspective_subjective_situee_et_entretien_en_re_situ_subjectif_Une_methodologie_de_constitution_de_l'experience","276935085_Recherches_sur_l'abstraction_reflechissante_1_L'abstraction_des_relations_logico-arithmetiques_2_L'abstraction_de_l'ordre_des_relations_spatiales","256309380_Understanding_Emotions","241853889_Emotions_and_Beliefs_How_Feelings_Influence_Thoughts","232509156_Positive_Affect_and_Decision_Making"]}
