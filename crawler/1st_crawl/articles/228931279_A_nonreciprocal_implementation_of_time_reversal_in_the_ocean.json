{"id":"228931279_A_nonreciprocal_implementation_of_time_reversal_in_the_ocean","abstract":"The performance of a time reversal mirror TRM in complex ocean scenarios can be evaluated without invoking spatial reciprocity in the experimental procedure. The experimental implementation requires connectivity between a source array and a receiver array but eliminates the requirement of actually having a probe source collocated with the receiver array. It is shown with data taken in a recent experiment that this streamlined, nonreciprocity-based time reversal procedure yields results potentially better than the classical time reversal method. Further, it provides a more versatile method to study a TRM in a fluctuating medium.","authors":["Philippe Roux","WA Kuperman","W. S.
