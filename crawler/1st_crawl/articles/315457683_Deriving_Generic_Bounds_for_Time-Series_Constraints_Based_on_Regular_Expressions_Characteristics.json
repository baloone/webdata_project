{"id":"315457683_Deriving_Generic_Bounds_for_Time-Series_Constraints_Based_on_Regular_Expressions_Characteristics","abstract":"We introduce the concept of regular expression characteristics as a unified way to concisely express bounds on time-series constraints. This allows us not only to define time-series constraints in a compositional way, but also to deal with their combinatorial aspect in a compositional way, without developing ad-hoc bounds for each time-series constraint separately.","authors":["Ekaterina Arafailova","Nicolas Beldiceanu","Helmut Simonis"],"meta":["January 2018Constraints 23(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10601-017-9276-z"],"references":["280852131_Describing_and_Generating_Solutions_for_the_EDF_Unit_Commitment_Problem_with_the_ModelSeeker","262284597_Regular_Functions_and_Cost_Register_Automata","308338890_Regular_Programming_for_Quantitative_Properties_of_Data_Streams","306392208_Systematic_Derivation_of_Bounds_and_Glue_Constraints_for_Time-Series_Constraints","302973578_Time-Series_Constraints_Improvements_and_Application_in_CP_and_MIP_Contexts","282539386_Approximate_Comparison_of_Functions_Computed_by_Distance_Automata","282190573_Linking_Prefixes_and_Suffixes_for_Constraints_Encoded_Using_Automata_with_Accumulators","281299324_Using_finite_transducers_for_describing_and_synthesising_structural_time-series_constraints","268862803_Algorithms_on_strings_Translated_from_the_2001_French_original","256720362_On_the_definition_of_a_family_of_automata","221633262_Deriving_Filtering_Algorithms_from_Constraint_Checkers","221633053_A_Generic_Visualization_Platform_for_CP","238164238_A_regular_language_membership_constraint_for_sequence_of_variables","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","221633333_A_Regular_Language_Membership_Constraint_for_Finite_Sequences_of_Variables"]}
