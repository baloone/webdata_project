{"id":"323791679_Information_System_Qualification_by_component","abstract":"Organizations nowadays focus more and more on business quality for various reasons, such as increasing their competitiveness, their productivity or their turnover, and since we are living on the digital era, information system quality requires great attention from all decision-makers.\nInformation System (IS) is by definition composed of five components namely human resources, hardware, software, procedures and data, therefore its qualification rely on the qualification of each component apart. A set of indicators has been defined and interpreted as questions to allow data gathering from a larger population including all IS players which are managers, technical staff, functional staff and users. Four types of surveys has been created to fit every IS player.\nIn this contribution, we emphasize on the survey designed for technical staff by explaining the reasons for not including the whole set of indicators and by finding mathematical formulas relating questions of the survey to indicators in the model, in order to quantify them numerically and aggregate them by component.","authors":["Sarah Aouhassi","Mostafa Hanoune"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1145/3178461.3178478","Conference: the 2018 International Conference","Project: Information System Quality"],"references":["262880992_Exploring_the_relationship_between_information_technology_competence_and_quality_management","262642236_Human_Resource_Information_Systems_HRIS_in_HR_Planning_and_Development_in_Mid_to_Large_Sized_Organizations","224187683_The_SQALE_Analysis_Model_An_Analysis_Model_Compliant_with_the_Representation_Condition_for_Assessing_the_Quality_of_Software_Source_Code","222671052_Beyond_strategic_information_systems_Towards_an_IS_capability","221569558_An_Empirical_Model_for_Continuous_and_Weighted_Metric_Aggregation","220578597_Organizational_impact_of_system_quality_information_quality_and_service_quality","4104985_Detection_startegies_Metrics-based_rules_for_detecting_design_flaws","282418462_Relationships_between_internal_and_external_systems_integration_cost_and_quality_performance_and_firm_profitability","276094873_Information_System_Quality_State_of_the_Art_and_New_Model","262273418_The_impacts_of_information_quality_and_system_quality_on_users'_continuance_intention_in_information-exchange_virtual_communities_An_empirical_investigation","260649632_Managing_technical_debt_with_the_SQALE_method","260009978_Empirical_study_of_open_source_software_selection_for_adoption_based_on_software_quality_characteristics","259160545_Quality_evaluation_framework_QEF_Modeling_and_evaluating_quality_of_business_processes","258207792_A_Decision_Support_Framework_for_Metric_Selection_in_Goal-Based_Measurement_Programs_GQM-DSFMS","257422235_Strategizing_information_systems-enabled_organizational_transformation_A_transdisciplinary_review_and_new_directions","220652255_Total_quality_in_software_development_An_empirical_study_of_quality_drivers_and_benefits_in_Indian_software_projects"]}
