{"id":"264465058_A_Branch-and-Prune_Algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","abstract":"The Molecular Distance Geometry Problem consists in finding the positions in R 3 of the atoms of a molecule, given some of the inter-atomic distances. We show that under an additional requirement on the given distances (which is realistic from the chemical point of view) this can be transformed to a combinatorial problem. We propose a Branch-and-Prune algorithm for the solution of this problem and report on very promising computational results.","authors":["Carlile Lavor","Leo Liberti","Nelson Maculan"],"meta":["November 2011International Transactions in Operational Research 18(6)","DOI:10.1111/j.1475-3995.2011.00807.x"],"references":["227658216_A_Branch-and-Prune_algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem"]}
