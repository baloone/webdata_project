{"id":"313112720_Distributed_Tracking_Control_of_an_Interconnected_Leader-Follower_Multiagent_System","abstract":"In the existing control problems for the leaderfollower multi-agent systems, the leader’s dynamics are independent of the followers. In this paper, we consider a tracking control problem for an interconnected leader-follower multi-agent system where the leader’s dynamics are interconnected with the states of the followers. It is shown that such a problem can be used to model the autonomous power sharing problem of grid-connected microgrids. In order to solve this problem, a distributed control law using only local information is synthesized. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control law.","authors":["He Cai","Guoqiang Hu"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2017.2660298"],"references":["287799171_A_Distributed_Feedforward_Approach_to_Cooperative_Control_of_AC_Microgrids","224603568_Attitude_Synchronization_of_a_Group_of_Spacecraft_Without_Velocity_Measurements","224227706_Optimal_Design_for_Synchronization_of_Cooperative_Systems_State_Feedback_Observer_and_Output_Feedback","273005597_Robust_consensus_tracking_for_a_class_of_high-order_multi-agent_systems","266703062_Distributed_Coordination_of_Multi-agent_Networks_Emergent_Problems_Models_and_Issues","260211588_The_leader-following_attitude_control_of_multiple_rigid_spacecraft_systems","257388365_Adaptive_Non-linear_Tracking_with_Complete_Compensation_of_Unknown_Disturbances","257200203_Topics_in_Matrix_Analysis","255180227_Nonlinear_Output_Regulation_Theory_and_Applications","230725473_The_Schur_Complement_and_Its_Applications","224392251_Attitude_Tracking_and_Disturbance_Rejection_of_Rigid_Spacecraft_by_Adaptive_Control","224259034_Cooperative_Output_Regulation_of_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems","224209727_Synchronization_of_Networks_of_Nonidentical_Euler-Lagrange_Systems_With_Uncertain_Parameters_and_Communication_Delays","222872078_Tracking_Control_for_Multi-Agent_consensus_with_an_Active_Leader_and_Variable_Topology","222815576_Region-based_shape_control_for_a_swarm_of_robots","221932985_Matrix_Analysis","220519570_Leader-following_Consensus_of_Multi-agent_Systems_Under_Fixed_and_Switching_Topologies","220519351_Robust_consensus_tracking_of_a_class_of_second-order_multi-agent_dynamic_systems","51939344_Distributed_Consensus_of_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_AdaptiveDynamic_Protocols"]}
