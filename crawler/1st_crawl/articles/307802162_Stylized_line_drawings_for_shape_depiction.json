{"id":"307802162_Stylized_line_drawings_for_shape_depiction","abstract":"As a simple yet effective means of visual communication, stylized line drawings generates images that are closer to human-drawn than are created by traditional computer graphics techniques with more expressing meaningful visual information. Due to increased demands of improving shape depiction with line drawings approach, a wide spectrum of stylized line drawings techniques have been developed to deal with this problem. This paper provides an overview of the current stylized line drawings techniques which developed over the past decade, structured according to the design characteristics and behavior of each technique. In addition, this paper discusses the advantages and shortcomings of each technique. The review then concludes with a discussion of the main issues and technical challenges for stylized line drawings techniques.","authors":["Riyad Al-Rousan","Mohd Shahrizal Sunar","Hoshang Kolivand"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1109/IDM.2015.7516335","Conference: 2015 4th International Conference on Interactive Digital Media (ICIDM)"],"references":["228921170_Locally_controllable_stylized_shading","220791904_Laplacian_lines_for_real-time_shape_illustration","220184715_Demarcating_Curves_for_Shape_Illustration","220183757_How_Well_Do_Line_Drawings_Depict_Shape","49675707_Improving_Shape_Depiction_under_Arbitrary_Rendering","3618204_Enhancing_transparent_skin_surfaces_with_ridge_and_valley_lines","258712454_Depicting_3D_shape_using_lines","249716906_State_of_the_Art_Non-Photorealistic_Rendering_NPR_Techniques","242411793_What_does_the_occluding_contour_tell_us_about_solid_shape_perception_13","239666505_Cartoon-Looking_Rendering_of_3D-Scenes","236592294_Silhouette_Detection_for_Real-Time_Shadow_in_Virtual_Environments","236592288_To_Combine_Silhouette_Detection_and_Stencil_Buffer_for_Generating_Real-Time_Shadow","234807966_Interactivity_is_the_key_to_expressive_visualization","228573648_A_Survey_of_Image-Morphologic_Primitives_in_Non-Photorealistic_Rendering","227747234_Multi-scale_Feature_Extraction_on_Point-Sampled_Surfaces","221523226_Isophote_distance_A_shading_approach_to_artistic_stroke_thickness","221523198_Highlight_lines_for_conveying_shape","220184174_Line_drawings_via_abstracted_shading","220183948_Suggestive_Contours_for_Conveying_Shape","220183915_Where_Do_People_Draw_Lines","220183843_Apparent_Ridges_for_Line_Drawing","47861451_Ridge-valley_lines_on_meshes_via_implicit_surface_fitting","47463306_X-Toon_An_extended_toon_shader","2880077_Interactive_Rendering_of_Suggestive_Contours_with_Temporal_Coherence","2609999_Real-Time_Nonphotorealistic_Rendering","2587892_An_Invitation_to_Discuss_Computer_Depiction"]}
