{"id":"242911063_On_total_9-coloring_planar_graphs_of_maximum_degree_seven","abstract":"Given a graph G, a total k-coloring of G is\na simultaneous coloring of the vertices and edges of G with\nat most k colors. If Δ(G) is the maximum degree\nof G, then no graph has a total Δ-coloring, but Vizing\nconjectured that every graph has a total (Δ + 2)-coloring.\nThis Total Coloring Conjecture remains open even for planar graphs.\nThis article proves one of the two remaining planar cases, showing\nthat every planar (and projective) graph with Δ ≤ 7 has a\ntotal 9-coloring by means of the discharging method. © 1999\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.
