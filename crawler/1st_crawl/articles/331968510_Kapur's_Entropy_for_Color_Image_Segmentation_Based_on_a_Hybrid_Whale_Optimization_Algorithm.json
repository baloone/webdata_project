{"id":"331968510_Kapur's_Entropy_for_Color_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_a_Hybrid_Whale_Optimization_Algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, a new hybrid whale optimization algorithm (WOA) called WOA-DE is\nproposed to better balance the exploitation and exploration phases of optimization. Differential evolution (DE) is adopted as a local search strategy with the purpose of enhancing exploitation capability. The WOA-DE algorithm is then utilized to solve the problem of multilevel color image segmentation that can be considered as a challenging optimization task. Kapur’s entropy is used to obtain an efficient image segmentation method. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, different images are selected for experiments, including natural images, satellite images and magnetic resonance (MR) images. The experimental results are compared with state-of-the-art\nmeta-heuristic algorithms as well as conventional approaches. Several performance measures have been used such as average fitness values, standard deviation (STD), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), feature similarity index (FSIM), Wilcoxon’s rank sum test, and Friedman test. The experimental results indicate that the WOA-DE algorithm is superior to the other meta-heuristic algorithms. In addition, to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, the Otsu method is used for comparison","authors":["Chunbo Lang","Heming Jia"],"meta":["March 2019Entropy 21(3):318","DOI:10.3390/e21030318","Project: intelligent optimization algorithm for multilevel color image segmentation problem"],"references":["328128122_A_novel_beta_differential_evolution_algorithm-based_fast_multilevel_thresholding_for_color_image_segmentation","324761051_Chaotic_Opposition-Based_Grey-Wolf_Optimization_Algorithm_based_on_Differential_Evolution_and_Disruption_Operator_for_Global_Optimization","323904915_Segmentation_of_histological_images_and_fibrosis_identification_with_a_convolutional_neural_network","333263255_A_New_Technique_for_Multilevel_Color_Image_Thresholding_based_on_Modified_Fuzzy_Entropy_and_Levy_Flight_Firefly_Algorithm","329154170_Image_segmentation_via_multilevel_thresholding_using_hybrid_optimization_algorithms","327223140_Parameter_extraction_of_solar_photovoltaic_models_using_an_improved_whale_optimization_algorithm","327089767_A_modified_whale_optimization_algorithm_for_large-scale_global_optimization_problems","327062749_A_Multi-Level_Thresholding_Method_for_Breast_Thermograms_Analysis_using_Dragonfly_Algorithm","326872990_Optimal_Multilevel_Thresholding_Selection_for_Brain_MRI_Image_Segmentation_based_on_Adaptive_Wind_Driven_Optimization","325162535_Multi-Level_Image_Thresholding_Using_Modified_Flower_Pollination_Algorithm","323436155_Chaotic_based_differential_evolution_algorithm_for_optimization_of_baker's_yeast_drying_process","321534481_A_hybrid_sine-cosine_optimization_algorithm_for_solving_global_optimization_problems","322143692_A_multi-level_thresholding_image_segmentation_based_on_an_improved_artificial_bee_colony_algorithm","321804471_Cross_entropy_based_thresholding_for_magnetic_resonance_brain_images_using_Crow_Search_Algorithm","319294589_An_efficient_method_for_Multilevel_Color_Image_Thresholding_using_Cuckoo_Search_Algorithm_based_on_Minimum_Cross_Entropy"]}
