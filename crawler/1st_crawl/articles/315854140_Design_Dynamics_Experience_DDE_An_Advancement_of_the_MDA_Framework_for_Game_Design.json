{"id":"315854140_Design_Dynamics_Experience_DDE_An_Advancement_of_the_MDA_Framework_for_Game_Design","abstract":"Although the Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics (MDA) framework is probably the most widely accepted and practically employed approach to game design, that framework has recently been criticized for several weaknesses. Other frameworks have been proposed to overcome those limitations, but none has generated sufficient support to replace MDA. In this chapter, we improve the MDA framework\n, place it on new pillars and thus present the Design, Dynamics,\nExperience (DDE) framework\nfor the design of computer and video games.","authors":["Wolfgang Walk","Daniel GÃ¶rlich","Mark Barrett"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-53088-8_3","In book: Game Dynamics (pp.27-45)","Project: Game Dynamics.
