{"id":"309366957_Coarse-Grained_Simulations_Complemented_by_Atomistic_Molecular_Dynamics_Provide_New_Insights_into_Folding_of_Human_Telomeric_G-Quadruplexes","abstract":"G-quadruplexes are the most important non-canonical DNA architectures. Many quadruplex-forming sequences, including the human telomeric sequence d(GGGTTA)n, have been investigated due to their implications in cancer and other diseases, and because of their potential in DNA-based nanotechnology. Despite availability of atomistic structural studies of folded G-quadruplexes, their folding pathways remain mysterious, and mutually contradicting models of folding coexist in the literature. Recent experiments convincingly demonstrated that G-quadruplex folding often takes days to reach the thermodynamics equilibrium. Based on atomistic simulations of diverse classes of intermediates of the G-quadruplex folding, we have suggested that the folding is an extremely multi-pathway process combining kinetic partitioning mechanism with conformational diffusion. However, complete G-quadruplex folding is far beyond the time scale of atomistic simulations. Here we for the first time use high-resolution coarse-grained simulations to investigate potential unfolding intermediates, whose structural dynamics are then further explored with all-atom simulations. This multiscale approach indicates how various pathways are interconnected in a complex network. For the first time, events of spontaneous conversions between different folds are observed. We demonstrate the inability of simple order parameters, such as radius of gyration or the number of native H-bonds, to describe the folding landscape of the G-quadruplexes. The study also provides information relevant to further development of the coarse-grained force field.","authors":["Petr Stadlbauer","Liuba Mazzanti","Tristan Cragnolini","David J.
