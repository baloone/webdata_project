{"id":"320262155_A_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Interpretable_Model_Extraction_from_Decision_Tree_Ensembles","abstract":"Models obtained by decision tree induction techniques excel in being interpretable. However, they can be prone to overfitting, which results in a low predictive performance. Ensemble techniques provide a solution to this problem, and are hence able to achieve higher accuracies. However, this comes at a cost of losing the excellent interpretability of the resulting model, making ensemble techniques impractical in applications where decision support, instead of decision making, is crucial. To bridge this gap, we present the genesim algorithm that transforms an ensemble of decision trees into a single decision tree with an enhanced predictive performance while maintaining interpretability by using a genetic algorithm. We compared genesim to prevalent decision tree induction algorithms, ensemble techniques and a similar technique, called ism, using twelve publicly available data sets. The results show that genesim achieves better predictive performance on most of these data sets compared to decision tree induction techniques & ism. The results also show that genesimâ€™s predictive performance is in the same order of magnitude as the ensemble techniques. However, the resulting model of genesim outperforms the ensemble techniques regarding interpretability as it has a very low complexity.","authors":["Gilles Vandewiele","Kiani Lannoye","Olivier Janssens","Femke Ongenae"],"meta":["October 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-67274-8_10","Conference: Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining"],"references":["265052539_Interpreting_Tree_Ensembles_with_inTrees","261351746_Interpretable_models_from_distributed_data_via_merging_of_decision_trees","224243034_A_Survey_of_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Decision-Tree_Induction","47646474_Improving_the_precision_of_classification_trees","2393893_Split_Selection_Methods_for_Classification_Trees","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","310824798_XGBoost_A_Scalable_Tree_Boosting_System","301839264_XGBoost_A_Scalable_Tree_Boosting_System","279901851_Split_selection_methods_for_classification_trees","277296025_Inducing_and_Combining_Decision_Structures_for_Expert_Systems","272825857_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository","270663502_Random_Forests","254902744_Seeing_the_Forest_through_the_Trees_Learning_a_Comprehensible_Model_from_a_First_Order_Ensemble","235961479_Classification_and_Regression_Trees","220813377_Generating_Production_Rules_from_Decision_Trees","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","11014613_Slonim_D_K_From_patterns_to_pathways_gene_expression_data_analysis_comes_of_age_Nature_Genet_32_Suppl_502-508","3297263_A_Fourier_Spectrum-Based_Approach_to_Represent_Decision_Trees_for_Mining_Data_Streams_in_Mobile_Environments","2631839_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2513411_MiniBoosting_Decision_Trees"]}
