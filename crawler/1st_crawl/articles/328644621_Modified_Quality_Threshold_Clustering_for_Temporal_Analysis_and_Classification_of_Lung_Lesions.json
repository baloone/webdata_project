{"id":"328644621_Modified_Quality_Threshold_Clustering_for_Temporal_Analysis_and_Classification_of_Lung_Lesions","abstract":"Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most kills after the beginning diagnostic. To aid the specialist in this diagnostic, the temporal evaluation comes up as a tool to analyze the indeterminate lesions that may be benign or malignant lesions during the treatment. With this intention, it is proposed a methodology for analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology used modified quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster and the changes in the lesion over time are defined when a voxel changes to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for lesion classification as benign or malignant. For the proposed methodology, it were used two bases of pulmonary lesions, a malignant in treatment (public) and one of indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22 to 36.93% of the lesion volume in a public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98 to 38.81% in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures inform the degree of changes for the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. Alternatively, from the statistical analysis of the regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with accuracy of 98.41%, which shows that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to the visualization of the density changes occurring in the lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the most commonly used technique to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions.","authors":["Stelmo Magalh√£es Barros Netto","Ari Silva","Anselmo Paiva","Rofolfo Acatauassu Nunes"],"meta":["October 2018IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2018.2878954"],"references":["324017848_The_ITK_Software_Guide","313788425_Unsupervised_detection_of_density_changes_through_principal_component_analysis_for_lung_lesion_classification","283976121_Semi-supervised_change_detection_approach_combining_sparse_fusion_and_constrained_k_means_for_multi-temporal_remote_sensing_images","277086630_Texture_analysis_of_125I-A5B7_anti-CEA_antibody_SPECT_differentiates_metastatic_colorectal_cancer_model_phenotypes_and_anti-vascular_therapy_response","267873688_3D_Texture_Analysis_in_Renal_Cell_Carcinoma_Tissue_Image_Grading","262566867_A_Study_of_Cross-Validation_and_Bootstrap_for_Accuracy_Estimation_and_Model_Selection","256099439_Field_JK_Oudkerk_M_Pedersen_JH_Duffy_SW_Prospects_for_population_screening_and_diagnosis_of_lung_cancer","225293606_Change_in_Tumor_Size_by_RECIST_Correlates_Linearly_With_Overall_Survival_in_Phase_I_Oncology_Studies","221967361_Internal_Growth_of_Nonsolid_Lung_Nodules_Radiologic-Pathologic_Correlation","221845558_Measurement_of_Tumor_Volumes_Improves_RECIST-Based_Response_Assessments_in_Advanced_Lung_Cancer","51855980_MRI_Texture_Analysis_in_Multiple_Sclerosis","7172162_On_Measuring_the_change_in_size_of_pulmonary_nodules","6452146_A_Novel_MRI_Texture_Analysis_of_Demyelination_and_Inflammation_in_Relapsing-Remitting_Experimental_Allergic_Encephalomyelitis","2352264_A_Study_of_Cross-Validation_and_Bootstrap_for_Accuracy_Estimation_and_Model_Selection","313537569_Statistical_Tools_for_the_Temporal_Analysis_and_Classification_of_Lung_Lesions","313178942_Reduced_lung-cancer_mortality_with_low-dose_computed_tomographic_screening","303181540_Voxel-based_comparative_analysis_of_lung_lesions_in_CT_for_therapeutic_purposes","288128969_An_unsupervised_approach_based_on_Riemannian_metric_to_change_detection_on_multi-temporal_SAR_images","286480247_Observer_variability_in_RECIST-based_tumour_burden_measurements_A_meta-analysis","280006461_Imaging_Tumor_Response_and_Tumoral_Heterogeneity_in_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer_Treated_With_Antiangiogenic_Therapy_Comparison_of_the_Prognostic_Ability_of_RECIST_11_an_Alternate_Method_Crabb_and_Image","262980614_Rough_Clustering_Based_Unsupervised_Image_Change_Detection","261880065_Rough_Clustering_Based_Unsupervised_Image_Change_Detection","261030963_Changes_in_Primary_Breast_Cancer_Heterogeneity_May_Augment_Midtreatment_MR_Imaging_Assessment_of_Response_to_Neoadjuvant_Chemotherapy","259152727_Response_to_neoadjuvant_treatment_of_invasive_ductal_breast_carcinomas_including_outcome_evaluation_MRI_analysis_by_an_automatic_CAD_system_in_comparison_to_visual_evaluation","255733884_Inter-observer_reproducibility_of_semi-automatic_tumor_diameter_measurement_and_volumetric_analysis_in_patients_with_lung_cancer","253390554_Computer-aided_diagnosis_for_interval_change_analysis_of_lung_nodule_features_in_serial_CT_examinations","245537940_Volumetric_response_classification_in_metastatic_solid_tumors_on_MSCT_Initial_results_in_a_whole-body_setting","238879873_Finding_the_Number_of_Clusters_in_a_Dataset","237844472_Computed_tomography_quantitative_analysis_of_components_A_new_method_monitoring_the_growth_of_pulmonary_nodule","221110756_Lung_Nodule_Growth_Analysis_from_3D_CT_Data_with_a_Coupled_Segmentation_and_Registration_Framework","51587818_Pulmonary_nodule_registration_Rigid_or_nonrigid","44587287_MRI_Texture_Analysis_in_Multiple_Sclerosis_Toward_a_Clinical_Analysis_Protocol","40451984_A_Public_Image_Database_to_Support_Research_in_Computer_Aided_Diagnosis","23679331_New_Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumours_revised_RECIST_guideline_version_11","7186139_Texture_analysis_of_foot_sole_soft_tissue_images_in_diabetic_neuropathy_using_wavelet_transform","6955179_Measures_of_response_RECIST_WHO_and_new_alternatives","5842516_Independent_Component_Analysis_Applied_to_Ultrasound_Speckle_Texture_Analysis_and_Tissue_Characterization","3297345_Cluster_Analysis_for_Gene_Expression_Data_A_Survey"]}
