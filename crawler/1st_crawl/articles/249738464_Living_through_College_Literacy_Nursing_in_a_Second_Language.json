{"id":"249738464_Living_through_College_Literacy_Nursing_in_a_Second_Language","abstract":"This case study of a Chinese undergraduate nursing student focuses on her literacy experiences in her nursing major. Although traditional academic writing played some role in her education, the unusual demands of nonacademic, disciplinary documents, particularly nursing care plans (NCPs), played a more significant and more intractable role in her education and in the difficulties she faced. This investigation of features of academic literacy across the curriculum also embeds this studentâ€™s experience in broader concerns of the nursing curriculum and nursing regulatory agencies, further complicating the role of disciplinary literacy acquisition.","authors":["Ilona Leki"],"meta":["January 2003Written Communication 20(1):81-98","DOI:10.1177/0741088303253571"],"references":["249738481_Contextualizing_Writing_and_Response_in_a_Graduate_Seminar","274178988_Moving_from_school_to_the_workplace_Disciplinary_innovation_border_crossings_and_the_reshaping_of_a_written_genre","272930439_Strangers_in_Academia_The_Experiences_of_Faculty_and_ESL_Students_Across_the_Curriculum","264736823_Building_a_Vocabulary_Througb_Academic_Reading","260354248_ESL_Versus_Mainstream_Classes_Contrasting_L2_Learning_Environments","260354102_Coping_Strategies_of_ESL_Students_in_Writing_Tasks_Across_the_Curriculum","240711333_The_Acquisition_of_Academic_Literacy_in_a_Second_Language_A_Longitudinal_Case_Study","223793815_Acquiring_Disciplinary_Literacy_A_Social-Cognitive_Analysis_of_Text_Production_and_Learning_among_Iranian_Graduate_Students_of_Education","223163575_Professional_Writing_and_the_Role_of_Incidental_Collaboration_Evidence_from_a_Medical_Setting","222763567_Staying_Out_of_Trouble_Apparent_Plagiarism_and_Academic_Survival","222642300_Entering_a_disciplinary_community_Conceptual_activities_required_to_write_for_one_introductory_university_course"]}
