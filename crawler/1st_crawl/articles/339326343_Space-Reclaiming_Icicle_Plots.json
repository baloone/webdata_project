{"id":"339326343_Space-Reclaiming_Icicle_Plots","abstract":"This paper describes the space-reclaiming icicle plots, hierarchy visualizations based on the visual metaphor of icicles. As a novelty, our approach tries to reclaim empty space in all hierarchy levels. This reclaiming results in an improved visibility of the hierarchy elements especially those in deeper levels. We implemented an algorithm that is capable of producing more space-reclaiming icicle plot variants. Several visual parameters can be tweaked to change the visual appearance and readability of the plots: among others, a space-reclaiming parameter, an empty space shrinking parameter, and a gap size. To illustrate the usefulness of the novel visualization technique we applied it, among others, to an NCBI taxonomy dataset consisting of more than 300,000 elements and with maximum depth 42. Moreover, we explore the parameter and design space by applying several values for the visual parameters. We also conducted a controlled user study with 17 participants and received qualitative feedback from 112 students from a visualization course.","authors":["Huub Van De Wetering","Nico Klaassen","Michael Burch"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.4908","Conference: Pacific Visualization 2020"],"references":["338068501_Interactive_Visualisation_of_Hierarchical_Quantitative_Data_An_Evaluation","316995391_Database_Resources_of_the_National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","267564122_Poster_A_Visual_Survey_of_Tree_Visualization","262149604_Treevisnet_A_Tree_Visualization_Reference","338077239_Overlap-Free_Drawing_of_Generalized_Pythagoras_Trees_for_Hierarchy_Visualization","322853413_Database_resources_of_the_National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","319325878_Bubble_Treemaps_for_Uncertainty_Visualization","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","265657635_Drawing_Free_Trees","262279615_Computing_Voronoi_Treemaps_Faster_Simpler_and_Resolution-independent"]}
