{"id":"336185238_Packing_degenerate_graphs","abstract":"Given D and γ>0, whenever c>0 is sufficiently small and n sufficiently large, if G is a family of D-degenerate graphs of individual orders at most n, maximum degrees at most cnlogn, and total number of edges at most (1−γ)(n2), then G packs into the complete graph Kn. Our proof proceeds by analysing a natural random greedy packing algorithm.","authors":["Peter Allen","Julia Böttcher","Jan Hladky","Diana Piguet"],"meta":["October 2019Advances in Mathematics 354:106739","DOI:10.1016/j.aim.2019.106739"],"references":["305638557_Packing_trees_of_unbounded_degrees_in_random_graphs","288890271_Packing_spanning_graphs_from_separable_families","262985496_An_approximate_version_of_the_Tree_Packing_Conjecture","306151491_On_a_problem_in_combinations_cambridge_and_dublin","305876300_Proof_of_the_1-factorization_and_Hamilton_Decomposition_Conjectures","301878306_Packing_minor-closed_families_of_graphs_into_complete_graphs","301648373_A_blow-up_lemma_for_approximate_decompositions","280220978_Fractional_Clique_Decompositions_of_Dense_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","266438363_Packing_trees_of_different_order_into_K_n","247575768_Solution_of_Kirkman's_Schoolgirl_Problem"]}
