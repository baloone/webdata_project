{"id":"320920359_A_remark_on_free_nearly_free_and_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves","abstract":"In this note we describe the minimal resolution of the ideal $I_f$, the saturation of the Jacobian ideal of a nearly free plane curve $C:f=0$. In particular, it follows that this ideal $I_f$ can be generated by at most 4 polynomials. Some applications to rational cuspidal plane curves are given, and a natural related question is raised.","authors":["Alexandru Dimca","Gabriel Sticlaru"],"meta":["November 2017","Project: Applications of Singularity Theory"],"references":["318488167_On_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves_and_the_local_cohomology_of_Jacobian_rings","317650077_On_the_Splitting_types_of_bundles_of_logarithmic_Vector_Fields_Along_Plane_Curves","308409668_Numerical_invariants_and_moduli_spaces_for_line_arrangements","278674221_Free_and_nearly_free_divisors_vsrational_cuspidal_plane_curves","274644782_Free_divisors_and_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves","315848143_On_Some_Conjectures_About_Free_and_Nearly_Free_Divisors","314239079_Hyperplane_Arrangements_An_Introduction","301847974_Line_arrangements_and_configurations_of_points_with_an_unusual_geometric_property","285458942_On_the_exponents_of_free_and_nearly_free_projective_plane_curves","281119805_Freeness_versus_maximal_global_Tjurina_number_for_plane_curves","232025280_Application_of_the_theory_of_the_discriminant_to_highly_singular_plane_curves","230568203_Homology_of_Homogeneous_Divisors","261065856_Hilbert_Series_and_Lefschetz_Properties_of_Dimension_One_Almost_Complete_Intersections","254204990_On_the_Number_of_Cusps_of_Rational_Cuspidal_Plane_Curves","238950869_The_local_cohomology_of_the_jacobian_ring"]}
