{"id":"266320284_Developing_and_Qualifying_Civil_Engineering_Programs_for_ABET_Accreditation","abstract":"The ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs is based upon the knowledge, skills and behavior, students acquire in a program through the curriculum. The acquired knowledge, skills and behavior are considered as student outcomes (SOs). Consequently, the program needs to set its own SOs to achieve program educational objectives (PEOs). The achievement of the program goals and objectives are verified by the assessment and evaluation of SOs and PEOs. In this paper, a general development process of engineering programs for accreditation and establishment process is discussed in details. This process is applicable to satisfy the ABET Criteria 2014 for accrediting new and existing B.Sc. Engineering Programs. The process can result in adjusting the PEOs, SOs and curriculum accordingly.","authors":["M. Iqbal Khan","Shehab S Mourad","Waleed M.
