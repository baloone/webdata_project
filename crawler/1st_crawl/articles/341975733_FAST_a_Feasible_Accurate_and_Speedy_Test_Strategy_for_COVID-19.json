{"id":"341975733_FAST_a_Feasible_Accurate_and_Speedy_Test_Strategy_for_COVID-19","abstract":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues worldwide, there is an urgent need to detect infected patients as quickly and accurately as possible. Group testing proposed by Technion [2] could improve efficiency greatly. However, the false negative rate (FNR) would be doubled. Using USA as an example, group testing would have over 70,000 false negatives, compared to 35,000 false negatives by individual testing.\nIn this paper, we propose a Flexible, Accurate and Speedy Test (FAST), which is faster and more accurate than any existing tests. FAST first forms small close contact subgroups, e.g. families and friends. It then pools subgroups to form larger groups before RT-PCR test is done. FAST needs a similar number of tests to Technion's method, but could sharply reduce the FNR to a negligible level. Again taking USA as example, FAST reduces the number of false negatives to just 2000 while it is seven times faster than individual testing.","authors":["Linjiajie Fang","Shen Ling","Bing-Yi Jing","Qing Yang"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1101/2020.06.04.20122473"],"references":["6416403_Quantification_of_mRNA_using_real-time_rt-PCR","340992308_Pooling_of_samples_for_testing_for_SARS-CoV-2_in_asymptomatic_people","38368084_The_Detection_of_Defective_Members_of_Large_Population"]}
