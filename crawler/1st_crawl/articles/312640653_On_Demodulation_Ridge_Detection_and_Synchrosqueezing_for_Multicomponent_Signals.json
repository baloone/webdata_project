{"id":"312640653_On_Demodulation_Ridge_Detection_and_Synchrosqueezing_for_Multicomponent_Signals","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel technique for the retrieval of the modes of a multicomponent signal using a time-frequency (TF) representation of the signal. Our approach is based on a novel ridge extraction method that takes into account the fact that the TF representation is both discrete in time and frequency, followed by a demodulation procedure. Numerical results show the benefits of the proposed approach for mode reconstruction in comparison to similar techniques that do not make use of demodulation. Furthermore, numerical investigations show that the proposed approach sharpens the TF representation on which it is built.","authors":["Sylvain Meignen","Duong Hung Pham","McLaughlin Stephen"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSP.2017.2656838","Project: ASTRES"],"references":["271726004_Second-Order_Synchrosqueezing_Transform_or_Invertible_Reassignment_Towards_Ideal_Time-Frequency_Representations","269295339_The_Fourier-based_Synchrosqueezing_Transform","258657991_A_New_Algorithm_for_Multicomponent_Signals_Analysis_Based_on_SynchroSqueezing_With_an_Application_to_Signal_Sampling_and_Denoising","285111988_The_empirical_mode_decomposition_and_the_Hilbert_spectrum_for_nonlinear_and_non-stationary_time_series_analysis","283303437_Theoretical_Analysis_of_the_Second-order_Synchrosqueezing_Transform","282299211_A_novel_generalized_demodulation_approach_for_multi-component_signals","271512945_A_Nonlinear_Squeezing_of_the_Continuous_Wavelet_Transform_Based_on_Auditory_Nerve_Models","261058559_Multicomponent_Signal_Denoising_with_SynchroSqueezing","260637408_Matching_Demodulation_Transform_and_SynchroSqueezing_in_Time-Frequency_Analysis","260398613_Time-Frequency_Reassignment_and_Synchrosqueezing_An_Overview"]}
