{"id":"272752118_New_representation_results_for_planar_graphs","abstract":"A universal representation theorem is derived that shows any graph is the\nintersection graph of one chordal graph, a number of co-bipartite graphs, and\none unit interval graph. Central to the the result is the notion of the clique\ncover width which is a generalization of the bandwidth parameter. Specifically,\nwe show that any planar graph is the intersection graph of one chordal graph,\nfour co-bipartite graphs, and one unit interval graph. Equivalently, any planar\ngraph is the intersection graph of a chordal graph and a graph that has {clique\ncover width} of at most seven. We further describe the extensions of the\nresults to graphs drawn on surfaces and graphs excluding a minor of crossing\nnumber of at most one.","authors":["Farhad Shahrokhi"],"meta":["February 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228942304_String_graphs_and_incomparability_graphs","257119457_Some_geometric_applications_of_Dilworth's_theorem","230596035_A_Separator_Theorem_for_Planar_Graphs","228610594_New_perspectives_on_interval_orders_and_interval_graphs","223673520_Interval_representations_of_planar_graphs","222644085_Polynomial-time_approximation_schemes_for_packing_and_piercing_fat_objects","222606696_The_intersections_of_subtrees_in_a_tree_are_exactly_chordal_graphs","222305559_A_Partial_K-Arboretum_of_Graphs_With_Bounded_Treewidth","220188820_Comparability_graphs_and_intersection_graphs","220075087_Graph_minors_III_Planar_tree-width"]}
