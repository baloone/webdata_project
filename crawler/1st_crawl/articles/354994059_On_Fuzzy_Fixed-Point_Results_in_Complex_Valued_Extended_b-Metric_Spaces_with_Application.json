Our results improve and extend certain recent results in literature. Moreover, we discuss an illustrative example to highlight the realized improvements. As application, we derive fixed-point results for multivalued mappings in the setting of complex valued extended -metric space.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the theory of fixed points, there is vital role of metric spaces which have useful applications in mathematics as well as in computer science, medicine, physics, and biology (see [1–3]). Many mathematicians generalized, improved, and extended the notion of metric spaces to vector-valued metric spaces of Perov [4], -metric space of Czerwik [5], cone metric spaces of Huang and Zhang [6], and others.\nIn 2011, Azam et al. [7] introduced the concept of complex valued metric space and obtained some common fixed-point results for rational contraction which consist of a pair of single valued mappings. Later on, many researchers [8–15] worked on this generalized metric space. Ahmad et al. [16] and Azam et al. [17] defined the generalized Housdorff metric function in the setting of complex valued metric space and obtained common fixed-point results for multivalued mappings. In [18], Mukheimer generalized the concept of complex valued metric space to complex valued -metric space. Recently, Naimatullah et al. [19] introduced the notion of complex valued extended -metric space as extension of complex valued -metric space and established some results for rational contractions in this generalized space.\nOn the contrary, Heilpern [20] introduced the concept of fuzzy mappings in the setting of metric linear spaces and extended Banach Contraction Principle [21]. In 2014, Kutbi et al. [22] established fuzzy fixed-point results in complex valued metric spaces and generalized the results in metric spaces. Owing to the notion of a complex valued metric space, Humaira et al. [23] proved some common fixed-point results under contractive condition for rational expressions.\nIn this paper, we define the generalized fuzzy contraction in the setting of complex valued extended -metric space and obtain some fuzzy fixed point results. As application, we derive the main results of Azam et al. [7], Rouzkard and Imdad [9], Ahmad et al. [16], and Kutbi et al. [22] for fuzzy and multivalued mappings in complex valued metric spaces.\n\n2. Preliminaries\nIn 2011, Azam et al. [7] introduced the complex valued metric space as follows.\nDefinition 1. (see [7]).

A fuzzy set in is a function with domain and values in , and is the collection of all fuzzy sets in . If is a fuzzy set and , then the function values is called the grade of membership of in . The -level set of is denoted by and is defined as follows:\nHere, denotes the closure of the set . Let be the collection of all fuzzy sets in a metric space .\nDefinition 7. (see [20]). Let be a nonempty set and be a MS. A mapping is called fuzzy mapping if is a mapping from into . A fuzzy mapping is a fuzzy subset on with membership function .

[22] used the above notion of fuzzy mappings in complex valued metric space (CVMS) and established the result for these mappings.\nIn this paper, we establish fuzzy fixed-point results in the setting of complex valued extended b-metric spaces (CVEbMS) and derive the above result of Kutbi et al. [22] for fuzzy mappings and some fixed-point result for multivalued mappings in CVMS.\n\n3. Main Result\nDefinition 9. Let be a CVEbMS.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have defined fuzzy contraction in the setting of complex valued extended -metric space and proved fuzzy fixed-point results. As application of our main theorems, we have derived fixed-point results for multivalued mappings. We hope that the results proved in this paper will form new connections for those who are working in complex valued extended -metric space.\nIn this direction, the future work will focus on studying the fixed points of -fuzzy mappings in complex valued extended -metric spaces. Also, coincidence point results for single valued mappings and left total relations can be established as future work. As applications, one can investigate the fractional differential inclusion problems.\n\nData Availability\nNo data were used to support this study.\n\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.","authors":["Amnah Essa Shammaky","Jamshaid Ahmad","Abdelhamied Farrag Sayed"],"meta":["September 2021Journal of Mathematics 2021:1-9","DOI:10.1155/2021/9995897"],"references":["348852156_Solutions_of_Integral_Equations_via_Fixed-Point_Results_on_Orthogonal_Gauge_Structure","337813441_Fixed_Point_Theorems_in_Complex_Valued_Extended_b-Metric_Spaces","330212664_Common_Fixed_Point_Results_for_Fuzzy_Mappings_on_Complex-Valued_Metric_Spaces_with_Homotopy_Results","323257946_Common_fixed_point_results_for_new_Ciric-type_rational_multivalued_F-contraction_with_an_application","303960077_COMMON_FIXED_POINT_THEOREMS_FOR_f_-CONTRACTION_MAPPINGS_IN_TVS-VALUED_CONE_METRIC_SPACE","275556238_On_Fuzzy_Fixed_Points_for_Fuzzy_Maps_with_Generalized_Weak_Property","268508401_Fixed_point_results_for_a-ps-locally_graphic_contraction_in_dislocated_qusai_metric_spaces","268066027_Common_fixed_point_theorems_for_multi-valued_mappings_in_complex-valued_metric_spaces","284401381_The_Cauchy_problem_for_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations","268315476_Phylogenetics","263973109_Common_Fixed_Points_For_Multi-Valued_Mappings_in_Complex_Valued_Metric_Spaces_with_Applications","262890265_Some_Common_Fixed_Point_Theorems_in_Complex_Valued_-Metric_Spaces","258395787_Some_Common_Fixed-Point_Theorems_for_Generalized-Contractive-Type_Mappings_on_Complex-Valued_Metric_Spaces","257878430_Some_fixed_point_theorems_in_complex_valued_metric_spaces","266309451_Contraction_mapping_in_b-metric_spaces"]}
