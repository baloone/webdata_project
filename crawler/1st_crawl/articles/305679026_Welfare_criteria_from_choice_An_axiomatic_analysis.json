{"id":"305679026_Welfare_criteria_from_choice_An_axiomatic_analysis","abstract":"We propose an axiomatic approach to the problem of deriving a (linear) welfare ordering from a choice function. Admissibility requires that the ordering assigned to a rational choice function is the one that rationalizes it. Neutrality states that the solution covaries with permutations of the alternatives. Persistence stipulates that the ordering assigned to two choice functions is also assigned to every choice function in between.\nWe prove that these properties characterize the sequential solution: the best alternative is the alternative chosen from the universal set; the second best is the one chosen when the best alternative is removed; and so on. We also discuss some alternative axioms and solutions.","authors":["Sean Horan","Yves Sprumont"],"meta":["July 2016Games and Economic Behavior 99","DOI:10.1016/j.geb.2016.07.005"],"references":["325423421_The_transitive_core_Inference_of_welfare_from_nontransitive_preference_relations","277776148_Inferring_Rationales_from_Choice_Identification_for_Rational_Shortlist_Methods","273334242_Welfare_Economics_and_Bounded_Rationality_The_Case_for_Model-Based_Approaches","253420677_Eliciting_Welfare_Preferences_From_Behavioral_Datasets","272770474_Axioms_of_Cooperative_Decision_Making","267137123_Choice_by_sequential_procedures","254405596_Update_Monotone_Preference_Rules","44318380_A_Measure_of_Rationality_and_Welfare","32895613_Rationalizing_Choice_Functions_by_Multiple_Rationales","24092042_Beyond_Revealed_Preference_Choice_Theoretic_Foundations_for_Behavioral_Welfare_Economics"]}
