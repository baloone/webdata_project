{"id":"333457916_Enhanced_Kprototypes_EKP_and_FCM_for_Improving_Clustering_of_the_Large_Mixed_Data","abstract":"Data mining is one of the most significant and developing trends in computer science world. It includes several concepts such as classification and clustering. In the current research we focus on the clustering methods. In this paper, we introduces a new enhanced Kprototypes algorithm (EKP) with three enhancements. The first is the centroids initialization methods, the second is the convergence condition which is connected to the distance between the new and old centroids, while the third is vectorization process which minimize the time complexity of KP significantly. We also modified the FCM algorithm to make the distance computation step more effective. We applied our test on two dataset (Adult and CoverType) which are large mixed dataset and one of them included missed values which treated by two different ways. In the experiments, we defined the best clustering algorithm, compare our results with traditional algorithms and the international studies. The results showed that EKP achieved 4.769s only to converge and 68Â±4% clustering accuracy. The results showed that EKP was better than EKP at CoverType dataset. The best initialization method was the space attribute-splitting with minimum time and maximum accuracy. We compared our research with the previous ones and found that our research achieved the best time and accuracy clustering.","authors":["Jabr Hanna","Faten Alkrdy"],"meta":["November 2018"],"references":["326827341_Hand_and_Finger_Fracture_Detection_and_Type_Classification_Using_Image_Processing","326617303_An_Efficient_Grid-Based_K-Prototypes_Algorithm_for_Sustainable_Decision-Making_on_Spatial_Objects","326262436_Iris_and_Palmprint_Decision_Fusion_to_Enhance_Human_Recognition","326262290_Human_Recognition_Based_On_Ear_Shape_Images_Using_PCA-Wavelets_and_Different_Classification_Methods","326262191_Hybrid_Recognition_System_under_Feature_Selection_and_Fusion","316348009_A_Fast_K-prototypes_Algorithm_Using_Partial_Distance_Computation","257391282_A_fuzzy_k-prototype_clustering_algorithm_for_mixed_numeric_and_categorical_data","257404536_A_Comparative_Study_of_Efficient_Initialization_Methods_for_the_K-Means_Clustering_Algorithm","256822754_Categorical-and-numerical-attribute_data_clustering_based_on_a_unified_similarity_metric_without_knowing_cluster_number","222429162_FCM-Based_Model_Selection_Algorithms_for_Determining_the_Number_of_Clusters","221654200_Fast_Approximate_Spectral_Clustering","220907006_Similarity_Measures_for_Categorical_Data_A_Comparative_Evaluation","220745822_Spectral_Clustering_for_a_Large_Data_Set_by_Reducing_the_Similarity_Matrix_Size","221606654_Large_Scale_Spectral_Clustering_with_Landmark-Based_Representation","221087604_A_New_Clustering_Algorithm_Based_on_Artificial_Immune_System"]}
