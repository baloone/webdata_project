We propose an adaptation of the Metropolis algorithm to take into account the different degeneracies of the two levels.","authors":["Jorge Linares","J Nasser","Kamel Boukheddaden","A Bousseksou"],"meta":["February 1995Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 140-144:1507-1508","DOI:10.1016/0304-8853(94)00913-9"],"references":["225710536_Structure_and_Bonding","224908084_Spin_Equilibria_in_IronII_Complexes","200105001_Equation_of_State_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","200104463_The_Monte_Carlo_Method_in_Statistical_Physics","44440505_Simulation_of_Diffusion_in_Lattice_Gases_and_Related_Kinetic_Phenomena","41705213_Transitions_Low_spin_-_High_spin_dans_les_complexes_de_Fe"]}
