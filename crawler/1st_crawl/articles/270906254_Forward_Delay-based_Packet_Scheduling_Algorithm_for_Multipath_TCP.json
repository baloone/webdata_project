{"id":"270906254_Forward_Delay-based_Packet_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Multipath_TCP","abstract":"Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is a transport layer protocol that allows network\ndevices to transfer data over multiple concurrent paths, and hence, utilizes\nthe network resources more effectively than does the traditional single-path\nTCP. However, as a reliable protocol, MPTCP still needs to deliver data packets\n(to the upper application) at the receiver in the same order they are\ntransmitted at the sender. The out-of-order packet problem becomes more severe\nfor MPTCP due to the heterogeneous nature of delay and bandwidth of each path.\nIn this paper, we propose the forward-delay-based packet scheduling (FDPS)\nalgorithm for MPTCP to address that problem. The main idea is that the sender\ndispatches packets via concurrent paths according to their estimated forward\ndelay and throughput differences. Via simulations with various network\nconditions, the results show that our algorithm significantly maintains\nin-order arrival packets at the receiver compared with several previous\nalgorithms.","authors":["Tuan-Anh Le","Loc Bui"],"meta":["February 2018Mobile Networks and Applications 23(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11036-017-0901-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266660693_Experimental_evaluation_of_multipath_TCP_schedulers","262238985_Design_implementation_and_evaluation_of_congestion_control_for_multipath_TCP","228910370_Practical_congestion_control_for_multipath_transport_protocols","220428804_Multi-path_TCP_a_joint_congestion_control_and_routing_scheme_to_exploit_path_diversity_in_the_internet","296640245_Multipath_TCP_algorithms","261847794_Multipath_TCP_Algorithms_Theory_and_Design","261082858_Improvement_of_MPTCP_Performance_in_heterogeneous_network_using_packet_scheduling_mechanism","261046500_Performance_comparison_of_scheduling_algorithms_for_multipath_transfer","239690927_TCP_Performance_Implications_of_Network_Path_Asymmetry","224140574_Multi-path_transmission_control_scheme_combining_bandwidth_aggregation_and_packet_scheduling_for_real-time_streaming_in_multi-path_environment","4130610_Analytic_end-to-end_estimation_for_the_one-way_delay_and_its_variation","3335249_Multi-Path_TCP_A_Joint_Congestion_Control_and_Routing_Scheme_to_Exploit_Path_Diversity_in_the_Internet","220195067_Stability_of_end-to-end_algorithms_for_joint_routing_and_rate_control","3942905_Estimation_of_clock_offset_from_one-way_delay_measurement_on_asymmetric_paths"]}
