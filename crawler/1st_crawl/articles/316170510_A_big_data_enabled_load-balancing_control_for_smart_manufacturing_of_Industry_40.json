{"id":"316170510_A_big_data_enabled_load-balancing_control_for_smart_manufacturing_of_Industry_40","abstract":"The concept of “Industry 4.0” that covers the topics of Internet of Things, cyber-physical system, and smart manufacturing, is a result of increasing demand of mass customized manufacturing. In this paper, a smart manufacturing framework of Industry 4.0 is presented. In the proposed framework, the shop-floor entities (machines, conveyers, etc.), the smart products and the cloud can communicate and negotiate interactively through networks. The shop-floor entities can be considered as agents based on the theory of multi-agent system. These agents implement dynamic reconfiguration in a collaborative manner to achieve agility and flexibility. However, without global coordination, problems such as load-unbalance and inefficiency may occur due to different abilities and performances of agents. Therefore, the intelligent evaluation and control algorithms are proposed to reduce the load-unbalance with the assistance of big data feedback. The experimental results indicate that the presented algorithms can easily be deployed in smart manufacturing system and can improve both load-balance and efficiency.","authors":["Di Li","Hao Tang","Shiyong Wang","Chengliang Liu"],"meta":["June 2017Cluster Computing 20(2):1-10","DOI:10.1007/s10586-017-0852-1"],"references":["308272452_Cloud-based_smart_manufacturing_for_personalized_candy_packing_application","302919495_Software-Defined_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_in_the_Context_of_Industry_40","291385881_Implementing_Smart_Factory_of_Industrie_40_An_Outlook","314819743_Cooperative_negotiation_in_a_multi-agent_system_for_real-time_load_balancing_of_a_mobile_cellular_network","310664617_Mobile_Services_for_Customization_Manufacturing_Systems_An_Example_of_Industry_40","309658859_Revisiting_unknown_RFID_tag_identification_in_large-scale_internet_of_things","304006576_On_the_Construction_of_Data_Aggregation_Tree_With_Maximizing_Lifetime_in_Large-Scale_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","302319749_Integrated_Manufacturing_Systems_Control_Using_a_Multi-Agent_System","289504267_Towards_Smart_Factory_for_Industry_40_A_Self-organized_Multi-agent_System_with_Big_Data_Based_Feedback_and_Coordination","287631379_Cloud_Manufacturing_Service_System_for_Industrial-Cluster-Oriented_Application","284929930_Cloud-Integrated_Cyber-Physical_Systems_for_Complex_Industrial_Applications","282479004_Data_Mining_for_the_Internet_of_Things_Literature_Review_and_Challenges","285495324_How_virtualization_decentralization_and_network_building_change_the_manufacturing_landscape_An_Industry_40_Perspective","284712515_An_Unlicensed_Taxi_Identification_Model_Based_on_Big_Data_Analysis","284372731_Collaborative_automation_from_rigid_coupling_towards_dynamic_reconfigurable_production_systems"]}
