{"id":"309172380_Quantitative_Algebraic_Reasoning","abstract":"We develop a quantitative analogue of equational reasoning which we call quantitative algebra. We define an equality relation indexed by rationals: a = &epsiv; b which we think of as saying that \"a is approximately equal to b up to an error of &epsiv; \". We have 4 interesting examples where we have a quantitative equational theory whose free algebras correspond to well known structures. In each case we have finitary and continuous versions. The four cases are: Hausdorff metrics from quantitive semilattices; p-Wasserstein metrics (hence also the Kantorovich metric) from barycentric algebras and also from pointed barycentric algebras and the total variation metric from a variant of barycentric algebras.","authors":["Radu Mardare","Prakash Panangaden","Gordon Plotkin"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2933575.2934518","Conference: the 31st Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium"],"references":["311430178_Mixed_powerdomains_for_probability_and_nondeterminism","228856810_The_Partial_Lambda-Calculus","220608644_Algebraic_Operations_and_Generic_Effects","220371000_Computational_Effects_and_Operations_An_Overview","220368288_The_Category_Theoretic_Understanding_of_Universal_Algebra_Lawvere_Theories_and_Monads","2398385_Variations_on_Algebra_monadicity_and_generalisations_of_equational_theories","2395926_Semantics_for_Algebraic_Operations","2384858_Notions_of_Computation_Determine_Monads","319394366_The_Partial_Lambda-Calculus","319391010_Notions_of_computation_and_monads","309091677_Probabilistic_NetKAT","287687224_An_Introduction_to_Effectus_Theory","277065078_Probabilistic_Non-Determinism","268406248_On_Finitary_Functors_and_Their_Presentations","262254044_Tabular_A_Schema-Driven_Probabilistic_Programming_Language","245275923_An_algorithm_for_quantitative_verification_of_probabilistic_systems","242359779_The_category_of_probabilistic_mappings","227279679_A_categorical_approach_to_probability_theory","225740338_Variations_on_Algebra_Monadicity_and_Generalisations_of_Equational_Therories","224011016_Optimal_transport_--_Old_and_new","222701424_An_Introduction_to_metric_semantics_operational_and_denotational_models_for_programming_and_specification_languages","222621829_Combining_effects_Sum_and_tensor","222460459_Semantics_of_probabilistic_programs","222452014_A_probabilistic_PDL","222434179_Combining_algebraic_effects_with_continuations","222403106_Recursively_defined_metric_spaces_without_contraction","220976291_Probabilistic_LCF","220700473_An_Algorithm_for_Quantitative_Verification_of_Probabilistic_Transition_Systems","220694920_Labelled_Markov_Processes","220151709_Metrics_for_Labelled_Markov_Processes","220148682_CPO'S_of_Measures_for_Nondeterminism","3501211_Probabilistic_powerdomain_of_evaluations","2593171_Notions_of_Computation_and_Monads","2493131_Stochastic_Lambda_Calculus_and_Monads_of_Probability_Distributions"]}
