{"id":"305939308_The_Relationship_between_Changes_in_Weight_Status_and_Insulin_Resistance_in_Youth","abstract":"This study examined changes in insulin resistance (IR) in 120 youth over two years. IR was quantified via homeostatic model (HOMA-IR), and weight status changes were quantified via body mass index (BMI). When all participants were considered, the mean HOMA-IR and BMI increased 13.4% and 1.65 units, respectively. Change in BMI z-score and percent change in HOMA-IR were moderately associated (). Follow-up analyses were performed for the following weight groups: NN (normal at baseline and two years later), NO (normal to overweight), ON (overweight to normal), and OO (overweight at both points). The NO group had a greater change in HOMA-IR (+50%) compared to other groups: ON (8%), NN (+2%), and OO (0.1%) (). The association between changes in BMI z-score and HOMA-IR was when only the NO and ON groups were included. These results reinforce the importance of preventing youth from becoming overweight to control IR.","authors":["Kristin S Ondrak","RobertG McMurray","Claudio L Battaglini","Kelly Evenson"],"meta":["April 2009International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology 2009(1):862061","DOI:10.1186/1687-9856-2009-862061"],"references":["246192704_Evaluation_of_the_Insulin_Resistance_Syndrome_in_5-_to_10YearOld_OverweightObese_African-American_Children","12873974_Visceral_fat_insulin_sensitivity_and_lipids_in_prepubertal_children","11339304_Pubertal_alterations_in_growth_and_body_composition_VI_Pubertal_insulin_resistance_Relation_to_adiposity_body_fat_distribution_and_hormone_release","8228293_Assessing_Weight-Related_Biochemical_Cardiovascular_Risk_Factors_in_African-American_Girls","7993265_Homeostasis_Model_Assessment_Is_More_Reliable_Than_the_Fasting_GlucoseInsulin_Ratio_and_Quantitative_Insulin_Sensitivity_Check_Index_for_Assessing_Insulin_Resistance_Among_Obese_Children_and_Adolescen","7774839_Obesity_and_the_Development_of_Insulin_Resistance_and_Impaired_Fasting_Glucose_in_Black_and_White_Adolescent_Girls_A_longitudinal_study","7606423_Changes_in_adipocyte_hormones_and_lipid_oxidation_associated_with_weight_loss_and_regain_in_severely_obese_adolescents","7172021_Accuracy_of_Pubertal_Tanner_Staging_Self-Reporting","6729926_Prevalence_and_Determinants_of_Insulin_Resistance_Among_US_Adolescents_A_population-based_study","6114543_Point_HOMA_-_Satisfactory_for_the_Time_Being_-_HOMA_The_best_bet_for_the_simple_determination_of_insulin_sensitivity_until_something_better_comes_along","277456836_Longitudinal_Changes_in_Body_Fat_in_African_American_and_Caucasian_Children_Influence_of_Fasting_Insulin_and_Insulin_Sensitivity","258923807_A_Self-Report_Measure_of_Pubertal_Status_Reliability_Validity_and_Initial_Norms","51379712_Assessment_of_Insulin_Sensitivity_from_Measurements_in_Fasting_State_and_During_an_Oral_Glucose_Tolerance_Test_in_Obese_Children","19261765_Homeostatis_model_assessment_-_Insulin_Resistance_and_Beta-Cell_Function_From_Fasting_Plasma-Glucose_and_insulin_concentration_in_man","15509528_Effects_of_maturational_age_on_insulin_sensitivity_during_puberty","15368830_Gender_and_Tanner_stage_differences_in_body_composition_and_insulin_sensitivity_in_early_pubertal_children","11236374_Comparison_Between_b-cell_Function_and_Insulin_Resistance_Indexes_in_Prepubertal_and_Pubertal_Obese_Children","8919689_Validation_of_surrogate_estimates_of_insulin_sensitivity_and_insulin_secretion_in_children_and_adolescents","8601533_Changes_in_the_atherogenic_risk_factor_profile_according_to_degree_of_weight_loss","8452412_Cortisol_and_Its_Relation_to_Insulin_Resistance_before_and_after_Weight_Loss_in_Obese_Children","8152274_Insulin_Sensitivity_Among_Obese_Children_and_Adolescents_According_to_Degree_of_Weight_Loss","7102327_Anthropometric_predictors_of_serum_fasting_insulin_in_9-_and_15-year-old_children_and_adolescents","7068438_Insulin_resistance_and_metabolic_syndrome_in_obese_French_children","6982289_Are_Obesity-Related_Metabolic_Risk_Factors_Modulated_by_the_Degree_of_Insulin_Resistance_in_Adolescents","6425513_Fitness_is_a_Stronger_Predictor_of_Fasting_Insulin_Levels_than_Fatness_in_Overweight_Male_Middle-School_Children","6242749_Effects_of_a_Weight_Management_Program_on_Body_Composition_and_Metabolic_Parameters_in_Overweight_Children_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial"]}
