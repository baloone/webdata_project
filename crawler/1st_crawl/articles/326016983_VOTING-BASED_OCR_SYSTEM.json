{"id":"326016983_VOTING-BASED_OCR_SYSTEM","abstract":"Current solutions for performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in both academic and commercial environments have good recognition capabilities but each one of them has limitations as a consequence of the assumptions made for the defining algorithmic approach. This paper aims to define a new OCR method that combines the results from different algorithms and/or engines. Because we know in advance the specific characteristics of each OCR approach in a given context, a voting algorithm can be applied between their results. The final result of the proposed method is a combination of the different algorithms and exhibits better characteristics than any individual version taken separately. Furthermore, we propose a fully integrated solution containing voting-based approaches for all the preprocessing stages necessary in a complete OCR solution: image binarization, image segmentation, and layout analyze.","authors":["Costin-Anton Boiangiu","Radu Ioanitescu","Razvan-Costin Dragomir"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":["277140773_VOTING_BASED_IMAGE_BINARIZATION","263541883_Voting-Based_Layout_Analysis","260076060_Voting-Based_Image_Segmentation","260075900_Text_Line_Segmentation_In_Handwritten_Documents_Based_On_Dynamic_Weights","247886491_The_Fourth_Annual_Test_of_OCR_Accuracy","242026167_Study_on_the_Optimizations_of_the_Hough_Transform_for_Image_Line_Detection","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","265064444_Image_Segmentation_by_using_Histogram_Thresholding","222646632_Pietikainen_M_Adaptive_Document_Image_Binarization_Pattern_Recognition_33_225-236","222260247_OCR_binarization_and_image_pre-processing_for_searching_historical_documents"]}
