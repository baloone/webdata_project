{"id":"272521652_An_Empirical_Study_of_Finding_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","abstract":"While there have been a number of studies about the efficacy of methods to\nfind exact Nash equilibria in bimatrix games, there has been little empirical\nwork on finding approximate Nash equilibria. Here we provide such a study that\ncompares a number of approximation methods and exact methods. In particular, we\nexplore the trade-off between the quality of approximate equilibrium and the\nrequired running time to find one. We found that the existing library GAMUT,\nwhich has been the de facto standard that has been used to test exact methods,\nis insufficient as a test bed for approximation methods since many of its games\nhave pure equilibria or other easy-to-find good approximate equilibria. We\nextend the breadth and depth of our study by including new interesting families\nof bimatrix games, and studying bimatrix games upto size $2000 \\times 2000$.\nFinally, we provide new close-to-worst-case examples for the best-performing\nalgorithms for finding approximate Nash equilibria.","authors":["John Fearnley","Tobenna Igwe","Rahul Savani"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-20086-6_26","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms"],"references":["309412324_The_Complexity_of_the_Homotopy_Method_Equilibrium_Selection_and_Lemke-Howson_Solutions","257142896_Polylogarithmic_Supports_Are_Required_for_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_below_23","232275986_Combining_local_search_techniques_and_path_following_for_bimatrix_games","225754383_Well_Supported_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","221455899_Run_the_GAMUT_A_Comprehensive_Approach_to_Evaluating_Game-Theoretic_Algorithms","220853485_Performance_Evaluation_of_a_Descent_Algorithm_for_Bi-matrix_Games","220853479_An_Optimization_Approach_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","220853436_A_Note_on_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","220616737_The_Complexity_of_Computing_a_Nash_Equilibrium","220465612_An_Optimization_Approach_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","270763339_Unit_Vector_Games","265454880_Equilibrium_Points_of_Bi-Matrix_Games","234841034_Ranking_Games_that_have_Competitiveness-based_Strategies","222696013_Simple_search_methods_for_finding_a_Nash_equilibrium","222101118_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_Below_Two-Thirds","222069855_A_note_on_approximate_Nash_equilibria","221604246_Mixed-Integer_Programming_Methods_for_Finding_Nash_Equilibria","221131570_Approximability_of_Symmetric_Bimatrix_Games_and_Related_Experiments","45926207_The_Complexity_of_the_Homotopy_Method_Equilibrium_Selection_andLemke-Howson_Solutions","41386442_New_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","23419997_An_Experimental_Analysis_of_Lemke-Howson_Algorithm","4896871_Hard-to-Solve_Bimatrix_Games","1764892_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria"]}
