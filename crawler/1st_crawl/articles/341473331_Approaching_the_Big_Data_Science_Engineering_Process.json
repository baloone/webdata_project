{"id":"341473331_Approaching_the_Big_Data_Science_Engineering_Process","abstract":"For many years now, researchers as well as practitioners are harnessing well-known data mining processes, such as the CRISP-DM or KDD, to realize their data analytics projects. In times of big data and data science, at which not only the volume, variety and velocity of the data increases, but also the complexity to process, store and manage them, conventional solutions are often not sufficient and even more sophisticated systems are needed. To overcome this situation, in this positioning paper the (big) data science engineering process is introduced to provide a guideline for the realization of data-intensive systems. For this purpose, using the design science research methodology, existing theory and current literature from relevant subdomains are contextualized, discussed and adapted.","authors":["Matthias Volk","Daniel Staegemann","Sascha Bosse","Robert HÃ¤usler"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.5220/0009569804280435","Conference: 5th International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security","Project: Decision Support for Big Data Projects"],"references":["338740292_Ask_the_Right_Questions_Requirements_Engineering_for_the_Execution_of_Big_Data_Projects_Full_Paper","338454903_Exploring_the_Specificities_and_Challenges_of_Testing_Big_Data_Systems","336318882_Understanding_Issues_in_Big_Data_Applications_-_A_Multidimensional_Endeavor","333362320_Challenging_Big_Data_Engineering_Positioning_of_Current_and_Future_Development","323773046_The_Effect_of_Big_Data_and_Analytics_on_Firm_Performance_An_Econometric_Analysis_Considering_Industry_Characteristics","323059347_A_requirement_engineering_model_for_big_data_software","322780994_Mind_the_Gap_Accounting_for_Measurement_Error_and_Misclassification_in_Variables_Generated_via_Data_Mining","318642179_Project_Management_for_Engineering_Business_and_Technology","317340662_A_Software_Reference_Architecture_for_Semantic-Aware_Big_Data_Systems","323500395_Big_data_for_cyber_physical_systems_in_industry_40_a_survey"]}
