{"id":"283570768_Resilient_Multi-Agent_Consensus_with_Asynchrony_and_Delayed_Information","abstract":"We consider a multi-agent network and study its resilient consensus taking account of cyber-security issues. In our setting, there may be some malicious agents whose aim is to prevent other normal agents from reaching consensus. They may do so by not complying with the given control laws and behaving arbitrarily. It is assumed that a bound on the number of such agents in the entire network or in each normal agent's neighborhood is known. The normal agents are equipped for such attacks with a simple algorithm where neighbors taking the largest and smallest values are ignored to avoid being influenced by malicious agents. We address this problem when the agents make updates asynchronously and the agents use bounded non-uniform time-varying delayed data. Topological conditions in terms of graph robustness are developed.","authors":["Seyed Mehran Dibaji","Hideaki Ishii"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1016/ifacol.2015.10.302","Conference: 5th IFAC Workshop on Distributed Estimation and Control in Networked Systems NecSys 2015At: Philadelphia,"],"references":["298135863_Resilient_Consensus_of_Double-Integrator_Multi-Agent_Networks_with_Communication_Delays","273127186_Resilient_Consensus_of_Second-Order_Agent_Networks_Asynchronous_Update_Rules_over_Robust_Graphs","224928638_Optimal_Byzantine-resilient_Convergence_in_Unidimensional_Robot_Networks","44425758_Parallel_and_distributed_computation_numerical_methods_Dimitri_P_Bertsekas_John_N_Tsitsiklis","277296348_Distributed_Algorithms","274196548_Consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_in_the_presence_of_locally_bounded_faults","273914442_A_Notion_of_Robustness_in_Complex_Networks","273393677_Cyberphysical_Security_in_Networked_Control_Systems_An_Introduction_to_the_Issue","267189059_Graph_Theoretic_Methods_in_Multi-Agent_Networks","257827548_Resilient_Asymptotic_Consensus_in_Asynchronous_Robust_Networks","257827547_Resilient_Asymptotic_Consensus_in_Robust_Networks","257827367_Resilient_Cooperative_Control_of_Networked_Multi-Agent_Systems","242514316_Low_Cost_Approximate_Agreement_In_Partially_Connected_Networks","228344906_State_Consensus_for_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Switching_Topologies_and_Time-Varying_Delays","220688827_Distributed_Algorithms","200031719_Impossibility_of_Distributed_Consensus_with_One_Faulty_Process","51990651_Iterative_Approximate_Byzantine_Consensus_in_Arbitrary_Directed_Graphs"]}
