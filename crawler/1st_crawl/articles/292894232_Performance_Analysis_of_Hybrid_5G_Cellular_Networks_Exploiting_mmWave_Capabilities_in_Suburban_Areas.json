{"id":"292894232_Performance_Analysis_of_Hybrid_5G_Cellular_Networks_Exploiting_mmWave_Capabilities_in_Suburban_Areas","abstract":"Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology is considered as a key enabler for 5G networks to achieve higher data rates with low transmission power by offloading the users with low signal-to-noise-ratios. Millimeter wave networks operating at E and W frequency bands have available bandwidth of 1 GHz or more to provide higher data rates whereas their propagation characteristics differ greatly from the conventional Ultra High Frequency (UHF) networks operating at sub 6 GHz frequency band. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance in terms of coverage and rate, of hybrid cellular networks where base stations (BSs) operating at mmWave and sub 6 GHz bands coexist in suburban environment such as a university campus. The actual building locations within a suburban university campus are modelled as blockages and the analysis is carried out for different densities of UHF and mmWave BSs for different densities of outdoor users. Our analysis also highlight that mmWave cellular networks are predominantly noise-limited due to larger available bandwidth in comparison to the interference limited conventional UHF networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of dense deployment of mmWave BSs to achieve better coverage and rate probabilities in comparison to the stand alone UHF network.","authors":["Muhammad Shahmeer Omar","Muhammad Ali Anjum","Syed Ali Hassan","Haris Pervaiz"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICC.2016.7511278","Conference: IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)"],"references":["266676207_Coverage_and_Rate_Trends_in_Dense_Urban_mmWave_Cellular_Networks","264579132_Millimeter-Wave_Enhanced_Local_Area_Systems_A_High-Data-Rate_Approach_for_Future_Wireless_Networks","264122992_Tractable_Model_for_Rate_in_Self-Backhauled_Millimeter_Wave_Cellular_Networks","260393207_Coverage_and_Rate_Analysis_for_Millimeter_Wave_Cellular_Networks","259695154_Millimeter_Wave_Cellular_Wireless_Networks_Potentials_and_Challenges","273645784_Millimeter_Wave_Mobile_Communications_for_5G_Cellular_It_Will_Work","261206411_28_GHz_Propagation_Measurements_for_Outdoor_Cellular_Communications_using_Steerable_Beam_Antennas_in_New_York_City","261148187_38_GHz_and_60_GHz_angle-dependent_propagation_for_cellular_peer-to-peer_wireless_communications","224248712_State_of_the_Art_in_60-GHz_Integrated_Circuits_and_Systems_for_Wireless_Communications"]}
