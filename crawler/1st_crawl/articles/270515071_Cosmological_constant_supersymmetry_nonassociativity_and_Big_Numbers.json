{"id":"270515071_Cosmological_constant_supersymmetry_nonassociativity_and_Big_Numbers","abstract":"The nonassociative generalization of supersymmetry is considered. It is shown\nthat the associator of four supersymmetry generators has the coefficient $\\sim\n\\hbar/ \\ell_0^2$ where $\\ell_0$ is some characteristic length. Two cases are\nconsidered: (a) $\\ell_0^{-2}$ coincides with the cosmological constant; (b)\n$\\ell_0$ is the classical radius of electron. It is also shown that the scaled\nconstant is of the order of $10^{-120}$ for the first case and $10^{-30}$ for\nthe second case. The possible manifestation and smallness of nonassociativity\nis discussed.","authors":["Vladimir Dzhunushaliev"],"meta":["January 2015European Physical Journal C 75(2)","DOI:10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3309-9","SourcearXiv","Project: Non associative generalization of SUSY"],"references":["235358518_Nonassociative_Generalization_of_Supersymmetry","260568419_The_trouble_with_physics_The_rise_of_string_theory_the_fall_of_a_science_and_what_comes_next","259307530_General_Relativity","241406298_Book_Review_GENERAL_RELATIVITY_AN_INTRODUCTION_FOR_PHYSICISTS","238958526_General_Relativity_An_Introduction_for_Physicists"]}
