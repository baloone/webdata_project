{"id":"275483718_Extended_analogy","abstract":"In computer science education one should employ creative teaching methods, especially for non-majors or beginning students. Students who are new to computer science typically find the field full of theoretical, technical, or even tedious concepts. Lack of interest, motivation, or understanding creates a difficult mix of students. This paper describes a technique which combines analogy and simple memory techniques to aid in the teaching of technical concepts.","authors":["Jeff Matocha","Tracy Camp","Ralph Hooper"],"meta":["March 1998ACM SIGCSE Bulletin 30(1):262-266","DOI:10.1145/274790.274309"],"references":["221538737_Simulation_game_for_teaching_communication_protocols","234828179_Game_playing_as_a_technique_for_teaching_parallel_computing_concepts","234787283_Teaching_Tools_for_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems"]}
