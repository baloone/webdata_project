{"id":"325003129_An_improved_chemical_reaction_optimization_algorithm_for_solving_traveling_salesman_problem","abstract":"Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known optimization problem which tries to find the shortest path between numbers of cities. Several approaches in literature are proposed to solve TSP in a reasonable time. Meta-heuristic Optimization techniques considered as one of these approaches such as Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO), which is a recently established meta-heuristic algorithm for solving optimization problems. CRO proved its success in solving many optimization problems. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm based on CRO and Greedy algorithms for solving the TSP problem called (GCRO). We first introduce a solution using CRO. Then we enhance the solution by hybridizing it with a greedy strategy. And then conduct a performance comparison between the CRO, GCRO and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in terms of error rate and execution time. Better results are obtained using the hybrid model GCRO.","authors":["Ameen Shaheen","Azzam Sleit","Saleh al-sharaeh"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1109/IACS.2018.8355438","Conference: 2018 9th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems (ICICS)"],"references":["319445258_Multi_Agent_model_based_on_Chemical_Reaction_Optimization_with_Greedy_algorithm_for_Flexible_Job_shop_Scheduling_Problem","316455662_Improving_visual_analyses_and_communications_of_ontology_by_dynamic_tree_case_study_computer_system","306021086_Comparing_between_different_approaches_to_solve_the_01_Knapsack_problem","304808517_Resource_Utilization_in_Cloud_Computing_as_an_Optimization_Problem","259893716_Parallel_Genetic_Algorithm_to_Solve_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_on_MapReduce_Framework_using_Hadoop_Cluster","257779624_Chemical_Reaction_Optimization_A_tutorial","318535477_A_Novel_Chemical_Reaction_Optimization_for_the_Distributed_Permutation_Flowshop_Scheduling_Problem_with_Makespan_Criterion","313243543_Parallel_chemical_reaction_optimization_for_the_quadratic_assignment_problem","263033153_A_Parallel_Implementation_of_Ant_Colony_Optimization_for_TSP_based_on_MapReduce_Framework","225507950_An_Introduction_to_Genetic_Algorithms","222408030_Traveling_Salesman_Should_not_be_Greedy_Domination_Analysis_of_Greedy-Type_Heuristics_for_the_TSP","220412981_Shortest_Path_Algorithms_An_Evaluation_Using_Real_Road_Networks","200578608_Approximating_Images_Using_Minimum_Bounding_Rectangles","221161619_Hybrid_algorithm_based_on_Chemical_Reaction_Optimization_and_Lin-Kernighan_local_search_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","216300904_Optimization_by_simulated_annealing"]}
