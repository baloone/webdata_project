{"id":"343646571_Quantitative_amplitude-measuring_PH-OTDR_with_peHz_sensitivity_using_a_multi-frequency_pulse_train","abstract":"We report an amplitude-measuring Rayleigh-based sensor that uses a series of frequency-shifted pulses to extract quantitative distributed strain measurements. By using frequency multiplexing, we are able to inject a train of 10 pulses into the fiber at once. This allows us to use a higher average input power than standard phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry systems, improving the sensitivity. The sensor recovers the strain by tracking the time-dependent amplitude of the Rayleigh backscattered light from all 10 pulses. This approach enables a sensor with a noise floor of 1.5pε/√Hz over 10 km of fiber with 12 m spatial resolution, a 5 kHz bandwidth, and a dynamic range of 80 dB at 1 kHz. The sensor exhibits a high degree of linearity and is immune to interference fading.","authors":["Matthew J Murray","Brandon Redding"],"meta":["August 2020Optics Letters 45(18)","DOI:10.1364/OL.400159"],"references":["338755240_Single-Shot_COTDR_Using_Sub-Chirped-Pulse_Extraction_Algorithm_for_Distributed_Strain_Sensing","333374213_Analysis_and_Reduction_of_Large_Errors_in_Rayleigh-Based_Distributed_Sensor","331868192_Fully_Distributed_Optical_Fiber_Strain_Sensor_With_10_-12_eHz_Sensitivity","324470583_Wavelength-scanning_coherent_OTDR_for_dynamic_high_strain_resolution_sensing","322347443_True_Phase_Measurement_of_Distributed_Vibration_Sensors_Based_on_Heterodyne_varphi_-OTDR","303850328_Single-shot_distributed_temperature_and_strain_tracking_using_direct_detection_phase-sensitive_OTDR_with_chirped_pulses","254058487_Thermal_Phase_Noise_Measurements_in_Optical_Fiber_Interferometers","249328256_An_Hybrid_WDMTDM_Reflectometric_Array","228759242_Overview_of_high_performance_fibre-optic_sensing","338925790_Quantitative_strain_sensing_in_a_multimode_fiber_using_dual_frequency_speckle_pattern_tracking","338755041_Fiber_distributed_acoustic_sensing_using_convolutional_long_short-term_memory_network_a_field_test_on_high-speed_railway_intrusion_detection","337282512_Quantitative_amplitude_measuring_ph-OTDR_using_multiple_uncorrelated_Rayleigh_backscattering_realizations","336112689_Fiber-optic_distributed_acoustic_sensor_based_on_a_chirped_pulse_and_a_non-matched_filter","335959252_Speckle-based_strain_sensing_in_multimode_fiber","322085854_The_use_of_multi-frequency_acquisition_to_significantly_improve_the_quality_of_fibre-optic_distributed_vibration_sensing","321175022_Fiber-optic_network_observations_of_earthquake_wavefields_Fiber-optic_earthquake_observations","315375675_Distributed_measurement_of_acoustic_vibration_location_with_frequency_multiplexed_phase-OTDR","312934227_Distributed_Fiber-Optic_Acoustic_Sensor_With_Enhanced_Response_Bandwidth_and_High_Signal-to-Noise_Ratio","311572390_Phase-sensitive_OTDR_probe_pulse_shapes_robust_against_modulation-instability_fading","290995445_Contributed_Review_Distributed_optical_fibre_dynamic_strain_sensing","279231536_Distributed_Strain_and_Vibration_Sensing_System_Based_on_Phase-Sensitive_OTDR","252063210_Sensing_With_Slow_Light_in_Fiber_Bragg_Gratings","249653908_Fiber_Optic_Sensors_in_Structural_Health_Monitoring","243479653_Fiber-Optic_Distributed_Strain_and_Temperature_Sensing_With_Very_High_Measurand_Resolution_Over_Long_Range_Using_Coherent_OTDR","26825478_Simple_technique_for_improving_the_resolution_of_the_delayed_self-heterodyne_method","5813130_Rayleigh_scattering_optical_frequency_correlation_in_a_single-mode_optical_fiber","3399590_Fading_in_heterodyne_OTDR","3238581_The_Performance_Limit_of_Coherent_OTDR_Enhanced_with_Optical_Fiber_Amplifiers_Due_to_Optical_Nonlinear_Phenomena","3237267_Lightwave_Systems_with_Optical_Amplifiers"]}
