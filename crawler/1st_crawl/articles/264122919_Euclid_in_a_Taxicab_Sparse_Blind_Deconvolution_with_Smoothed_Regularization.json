{"id":"264122919_Euclid_in_a_Taxicab_Sparse_Blind_Deconvolution_with_Smoothed_Regularization","abstract":"The l1/l2 ratio regularization function has shown good performance for\nretrieving sparse signals in a number of recent works, in the context of blind\ndeconvolution. Indeed, it benefits from a scale invariance property much\ndesirable in the blind context. However, the l1/l2 function raises some\ndifficulties when solving the nonconvex and nonsmooth minimization problems\nresulting from the use of such a penalty term in current restoration methods.\nIn this paper, we propose a new penalty based on a smooth approximation to the\nl1/l2 function. In addition, we develop a proximal-based algorithm to solve\nvariational problems involving this function and we derive theoretical\nconvergence results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a\ncomparison with a recent alternating optimization strategy dealing with the\nexact l1/l2 term, on an application to seismic data blind deconvolution.","authors":["Audrey Repetti","Mai Quyen Pham","Laurent Duval","Emilie Chouzenoux"],"meta":["May 2015Signal Processing Letters, IEEE 22(5):539-543","DOI:10.1109/LSP.2014.2362861","SourcearXiv","Project: Seismic data restoration with sparsity constraints"],"references":["281047600_A_block_coordinate_variable_metric_forward-backward_algorithm","268743112_Variable_Metric_Forward-Backward_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_the_Sum_of_a_Differentiable_Function_and_a_Convex_Function","265201859_A_Block_Coordinate_Descent_Method_for_Regularized_Multiconvex_Optimization_with_Applications_to_Nonnegative_Tensor_Factorization_and_Completion","263001120_A_Primal-Dual_Proximal_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Template-Based_Adaptive_Filtering_Application_to_Seismic_Multiple_Removal","261253205_Sparse_K-Means_with_ell_inftyell_0_Penalty_for_High-Dimensional_Data_Clustering","261016666_Maximum_Phase_Modeling_for_Sparse_Linear_Prediction_of_Speech","313876742_Proximiteet_dualite_dans_un_espace_hilbertien","279904668_Non-negative_Matrix_Factorization_with_Sparseness_Constraints","261494679_A_fundamental_pitfall_in_blind_deconvolution_with_sparse_and_shift-invariant_priors","261095300_A_Sparsity-Based_Design_of_Regularization_Parameter_for_Adaptive_Proximal_Forward-Backward_Splitting_Algorithm","257480087_Proximal_alternating_linearized_minimization_for_nonconvex_and_nonsmooth_problems","254060937_Unsupervised_Processing_of_Geophysical_Signals_A_Review_of_Some_Key_Aspects_of_Blind_Deconvolution_and_Blind_Source_Separation","259441113_Rounding_Sum-of-Squares_Relaxations","257410005_Recovering_the_Sparsest_Element_in_a_Subspace","257121270_Fixed-Point_Algorithms_for_Inverse_Problems_in_Science_and_Engineering"]}
