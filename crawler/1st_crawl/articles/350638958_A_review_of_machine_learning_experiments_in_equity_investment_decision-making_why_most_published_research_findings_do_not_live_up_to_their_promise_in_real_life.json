{"id":"350638958_A_review_of_machine_learning_experiments_in_equity_investment_decision-making_why_most_published_research_findings_do_not_live_up_to_their_promise_in_real_life","abstract":"The numerical nature of financial markets makes market forecasting and portfolio construction a good use case for machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI). Over the past two decades, a number of academics worldwide (mostly from the field of computer science) produced a sizeable body of experimental research. Many publications claim highly accurate forecasts or highly profitable investment strategies. At the same time, the picture of real-world AI-driven investments is ambiguous and conspicuously lacking in high-profile success cases (while it is not lacking in high-profile failures). We conducted a literature review of 27 academic experiments spanning over two decades and contrasted them with real-life examples of machine learning-driven funds to try to explain this apparent contradiction. The specific contributions our article will make are as follows: (1) A comprehensive, thematic review (quantitative and qualitative) of multiple academic experiments from the investment management perspective. (2) A critical evaluation of running multiple versions of the same models in parallel and disclosing the best-performing ones only (“cherry-picking”). (3) Recommendations on how to approach future experiments so that their outcomes are unambiguously measurable and useful for the investment industry. (4) An in-depth comparison of real-life cases of ML-driven funds versus academic experiments. We will discuss whether present-day ML algorithms could make feasible and profitable investments in the equity markets.","authors":["Wojtek Buczynski","Fabio Cuzzolin","Barbara Sahakian"],"meta":["April 2021International Journal of Data Science and Analytics 11(4)","DOI:10.1007/s41060-021-00245-5"],"references":["340578916_Knowing_Me_Knowing_You_Theory_of_Mind_in_AI","308555826_Forecasting_sp_500_index_using_artificial_neural_networks_and_design_of_experiments","325786183_Predicting_Short-Term_Stock_Prices_using_Ensemble_Methods_and_Online_Data_Sources","321630147_Deep_learning_with_long_short-term_memory_networks_for_financial_market_predictions","309380988_Deep_neural_networks_gradient-boosted_trees_random_forests_Statistical_arbitrage_on_the_SP_500","308487745_Forecasting_daily_stock_market_return_using_dimensionality_reduction","301831445_An_adaptive_stock_index_trading_decision_support_system","293044678_Application_of_artificial_neural_network_for_the_prediction_of_stock_market_returns_The_case_of_the_Japanese_stock_market","284603332_Stock_Trading_With_Random_Forests_Trend_Detection_Tests_and_Force_Index_Volume_Indicators","273106564_A_bat-neural_network_multi-agent_system_BNNMAS_for_stock_price_prediction_Case_study_of_DAX_stock_price"]}
