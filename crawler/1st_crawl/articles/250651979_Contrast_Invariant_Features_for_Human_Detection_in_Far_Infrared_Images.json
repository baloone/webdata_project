{"id":"250651979_Contrast_Invariant_Features_for_Human_Detection_in_Far_Infrared_Images","abstract":"In this paper a new contrast invariant descriptor for human detection in long-wave infrared images is proposed. It exploits local information histogram of orientations of phase coherence. Contrast in infrared images depends on the temperature of the object and the background, which makes gradient based descriptors less robust, especially in daylight conditions. The objective is to obtain a scale, brightness and contrast invariant descriptor that can successfully detect pedestrians in images taken with a cheap, temperature-sensitive, uncooled microbolometer. The descriptor, packed into grids is feed to a Support Vector Machine classifier. The algorithm has been tested in night and day sequences and its performance is compared with a day only descriptor: the histogram of oriented features (HOG).","authors":["Daniel Olmeda","Arturo de la Escalera","J.M.
