To achieve this, an instrument was designed and evaluated\nwith a group of students of administration and computer sciences of a Colombian university and a Mexican\nuniversity. The results show that Colombian and Mexican students have similar mobile devices and they are\nwilling to use them as a means of learning. Besides, it was found that both the administration students and\nthe computer science students equally accept the use their mobile devices for learning. From the students'\nperspective, they have the technical means, the time and the willingness for mobile learning in both\nuniversities.","authors":["Agustin Lagunes Dominguez","Carlos Arturo Torres Gastel√∫","Joel Angulo Armenta","Miguel Angel Martinez Olea"],"meta":["February 2017Formacion Universitaria 10(1):101 - 108","DOI:10.4067/S0718-50062017000100011","Projects: Development of a multimodal teaching method to develop the research culture in universityCompetencias digitales del docente universitario"],"references":["299500585_Modelo_de_Calidad_de_E-learning_para_Instituciones_de_Educacion_Superior_en_Colombia","295562881_Strategies_for_Enhancing_the_Utilization_of_Information_and_Communication_Technology_ICT-Based_Library_Resources_in_Research","286220256_Teaching_and_Learning_with_Mobile_Technology_A_Qualitative_Explorative_Study_about_the_Introduction_of_Tablet_Devices_in_Secondary_Education","309143387_A_review_of_models_and_frameworks_for_designing_mobile_learning_experiences_and_environments","305197419_A_Critical_Meta-Analysis_of_Mobile_Learning_Research_in_Higher_Education","297765227_Effects_of_situated_mobile_learning_approach_on_learning_motivation_and_performance_of_EFL_students","283798794_Knowledge_extraction_from_usage_data_of_mobile_devices_with_educational_purposes","283001308_5E_Mobile_Inquiry_Learning_Approach_for_Enhancing_Learning_Motivation_and_Scientific_Inquiry_Ability_of_University_Students","282904884_Impact_of_ICT_on_Job_Satisfaction_among_University_Library_Professionals_of_West_Bengal_A_Comparison_Study","277027674_Is_ICT_a_new_essential_for_national_economic_growth_in_an_information_society"]}
