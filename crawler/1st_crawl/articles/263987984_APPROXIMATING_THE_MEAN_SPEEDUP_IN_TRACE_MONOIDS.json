{"id":"263987984_APPROXIMATING_THE_MEAN_SPEEDUP_IN_TRACE_MONOIDS","abstract":"Traces can be viewed as parallel processes and the \"mean speedup\" of a trace monoid has been introduced as a measure of \"intrinsic parallelism\" of the monoid. We study the problem of computing the mean speedup under two conditions: uniform distribution on the words of given length and uniform distribution on the traces of given height. In the first case, we give an approximability result showing a probabilistic fully polynomial time approximation scheme, while, in the second case, we prove that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within n1-c for every âˆŠ > 0, unless NP = coR. A further consequence is the hardness of the problem of generating traces of a given height uniformly at random.","authors":["Albertobertoni","Robertoradicioni"],"meta":["November 2011International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science 19(03)","DOI:10.1142/S0129054108005796","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["3023845_Approximating_the_spectral_radius_of_sets_of_matrices_in_the_max-algebra_is_NP-hard","2694858_Task_Resource_Models_and_max_Automata","2556133_Methods_For_Computing_The_Concurrency_Degree_Of_Commutation_Monoids","344484944_Randomized_Algorithms","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","243770212_Problemes_Combinatoires_de_Commutation_et_Rearrangements","239059787_Concurrent_Program_Schemes_and_their_Interpretations","238836160_On_the_Estimation_of_the_Throughput_for_a_Class_of_Stochastic_Resources_Sharing_Systems","233307916_Dynamics_of_synchronized_parallel_systems","232619366_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within_n1_-_E","228057840_Randomized_Algorithms","223462690_Concurrency_measure_in_commutation_monoids","222660878_Computing_the_average_parallelism_in_trace_monoids","3022418_Performance_evaluation_of_max_automata"]}
