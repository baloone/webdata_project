{"id":"279357913_Sliding_Modes_in_Control_and_Optimization","abstract":"In this chapter, we make use of the decomposition method for finding the desired allocation of eigenvalues in time-invariant linear systems of the form $$x = Ax + Bu,x \\in {\\mathbb{R}^n},u \\in {\\mathbb{R}^m},$$ (7.1) with constant matrices A and B. The discontinuity surfaces are assumed to be linear, i. e. $$s = Cx$$ (7.2) with C being a (m x n)-dimensional matrix.","authors":["Vadim I.
