{"id":"326369459_Some_Properties_of_Total_Frame_Domination_in_Graphs","abstract":"The principle of domination in graph theory has been applied in various fields, epically in computer science. Several definitions of domination have been presented during last decades. In this work we introduce a new concept of domination in graph G=(V,E), named \"total frame domination\". Also we define the inverse total frame domination. In addition, we determine the total frame domination number and total frame dominating set through this work. Furthermore, we prove some important properties of total frame domination number. Finally, we study the effects of removing vertex or edge from the given graph. According to the result of this work we conclude that the total frame domination is more effective in real life applications, especially in social media field.","authors":["Yasen Rajihy"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences 13(1)","DOI:10.3923/jeasci.2018.2403.2406"],"references":[]}
