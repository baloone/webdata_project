{"id":"228602456_Highway_emergency_rehabilitation_scheduling_in_post-earthquake_72_hours","abstract":"In the chaos of earthquake, due to the difficulties of obtaining information, most of the previous studies only focus on the rescue works; but not stress enough on highway emergency rehabilitation. Highway emergency rehabilitation means the works of road repairing in the golden rescue period, i.e., post-earthquake 72 hours. The objective of this study is to develop a scheduling model for highway emergency rehabilitation right after earthquake attacks. This paper has first defined the problem of emergency rehabilitation. Then a multiobjective-programming model is developed considering the constraints of time and resources. Three objectives are formulated in this paper including maximizing the performance of emergency rehabilitation, minimizing the risk of rescuers, and maximizing the savings of life. Finally, a case study presenting the Chi-Chi earthquake, a disaster happened in central Taiwan couple years ago, is conducted. Conclusions of the case study are the recommendations to the emergency rehabilitation decision if it can be done again.","authors":["Cheng-Min Feng","Tsai-Chu Wang","Ph D Student"],"meta":["January 2003"],"references":["250382399_A_Fuzzy_Multi-objective_Model_for_Reconstructing_the_Post-quake_Road-network_by_Genetic_Algorithm","314354267_Evaluation_of_the_optimum_restoration_process_for_transportation_systems_after_seismic_disaster","245306273_Risk_Management_Principles_of_Transportation_Facility_Design_Engineering","23526424_Measuring_post-disaster_transportation_system_performance_The_1995_Kobe_earthquake_in_comparative_perspective"]}
