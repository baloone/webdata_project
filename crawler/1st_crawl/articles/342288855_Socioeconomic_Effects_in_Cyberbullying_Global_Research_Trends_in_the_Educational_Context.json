{"id":"342288855_Socioeconomic_Effects_in_Cyberbullying_Global_Research_Trends_in_the_Educational_Context","abstract":"Nowadays, cyberbullying has become a problem of social harassment in numerous educational centres worldwide. New communication technologies have provided the perfect support for the development of this type of harassment in peer relationships, in addition to being linked to broad social and economic circumstances. In this study, the global trends of the socioeconomic implications of cyberbullying in the educational context have been analysed, from 2004 to 2019. Thus, a bibliometric analysis has been applied to 1128 articles, obtaining results of the evolution of scientific activity in this period. The articles are mainly associated with the thematic areas of Social Sciences, Psychology, Medicine and Computer Science. Seven main thematic axes have been detected, highlighting those related to the psychological aspect, adolescence, and the school environment. Likewise, the link of the main authors, institutions, and countries to these lines of research has been detected. The evidence has shown the interest and relevance of this topic at the international level. Future research lines propose different analyses about how certain socioeconomic factors influence this psychological harassment inside and outside the classroom.","authors":["Eloy López Meneses","Esteban Vázquez-Cano","Mariana-Daniela González-Zamar","Emilio Abad-Segura"],"meta":["June 2020International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 17(12):4369","DOI:10.3390/ijerph17124369"],"references":["340699379_Global_Research_Trends_in_Financial_Transactions","339839345_Sustainable_Management_of_Digital_Transformation_in_Higher_Education_Global_Research_Trends","339291681_The_Systematic_Application_of_Network_Diagnostics_to_Monitor_and_Tackle_Bullying_and_Victimization_in_Schools","339014550_The_Impact_of_the_University_Classroom_on_Managing_the_Socio-Educational_Well-being_A_Global_Study","338905764_Global_Research_Trends_and_Hotspots_on_Submarine_Groundwater_Discharge_SGD_A_Bibliometric_Analysis","338855336_Exploring_Modes_Strategies_and_Psychosocial_Consequences_of_Cyberbullying_Perpetration_and_Victimization_Among_University_Students_Cyberbullying_is_an_emerging_problem_since_information_and_communicat","338733107_Incidence_of_a_Non-Sustainability_Use_of_Technology_on_Students'_Reading_Performance_in_Pisa","338610074_Effectiveness_of_the_Whole_School-Based_Program_for_Equipping_High_School_Counselors_with_Strategies_of_Coping_with_Cyberbullying_and_Cyberbullying_Awareness","338527044_Bullying_y_cyberbullying_diferencias_de_sexo_en_victimas_agresores_y_observadores1","338519681_Through_the_looking_glass_Cyberbullying"]}
