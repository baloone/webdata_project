{"id":"277603575_Monotonic_Properties_of_Collections_of_Maximum_Independent_Sets_of_a_Graph","abstract":"Let G be a simple graph with vertex set V(G). A subset S of V(G) is\nindependent if no two vertices from S are adjacent. The graph G is known to be\na Konig-Egervary if alpha(G) + mu(G)= |V(G)|, where alpha(G) denotes the size\nof a maximum independent set and mu(G) is the cardinality of a maximum\nmatching. Let Omega(G) denote the family of all maximum independent sets, and f\nbe the function from the set of subcollections Gamma of Omega(G) such that\nf(Gamma) = (the cardinality of the union of elements of Gamma) + (the\ncardinality of the intersection of elements of Gamma). Our main finding claims\nthat f is \"<<\"-increasing, where the preorder {Gamma1} << {Gamma2} means that\nthe union of all elements of {Gamma1} is a subset of the union of all elements\nof {Gamma2}, while the intersection of all elements of {Gamma2} is a subset of\nthe intersection of all elements of {Gamma1}. Let us say that a family {Gamma}\nis a Konig-Egervary collection if f(Gamma) = 2*alpha(G). We conclude with the\nobservation that for every graph G each subcollection of a Konig-Egervary\ncollection is Konig-Egervary as well.","authors":["Adi Jarden","Vadim Levit","Eugen Mandrescu"],"meta":["July 2019Order 36(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11083-018-9461-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257406865_Critical_Independent_Sets_and_Konig-Egervary_Graphs","338523762_On_Some_Conjectures_Concerning_Critical_Independent_Sets_of_a_Graph","316807044_Algorithms_and_Computation_in_Mathematics","273329358_Polynomial_Time_Recognition_of_Essential_Graphs_Having_Stability_Number_Equal_to_Matching_Number","266523135_Combinatorial_Algebraic_Topology","257001118_On_maximum_matchings_in_Konig-Egervary_graphs","228991216_A_note_on_critical_independence_reductions","223627756_On_the_number_of_vertices_belonging_to_all_maximum_stable_sets_of_a_graph","223068640_On_a-stable_Konig-Egervary_graphs","222823277_The_critical_independence_number_and_an_independence_decomposition"]}
