{"id":"311621800_Towards_multispecies_interaction_environments_extending_accessibility_to_canine_users","abstract":"In this paper we discuss the role of mobility assistance dogs in human society and the challenges they face when operating in human environments. We present the findings of an ethnographic study at a training facility as well as the findings of early evaluations of canine-friendly switches. We discuss how the species-specific implementation of core interaction design principles could inform the design of interaction environments that better support these skilled workers.","authors":["Clara Mancini","Sha Li","Grainne O'Connor","Jose Valencia"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1145/2995257.2995395","Conference: the Third International Conference"],"references":["288426025_Going_to_the_dogs_Towards_an_interactive_touchscreen_interface_for_working_dogs","277813811_Re-Centering_Multispecies_Practices_a_Canine_Interface_for_Cancer_Detection_Dogs","277813689_UbiComp_for_Animal_Welfare_Envisioning_Smart_Environments_for_Kennelled_Dogs","266655814_Canine-centered_interface_design_Supporting_the_work_of_diabetes_alert_dogs","266654292_FIDO_-_facilitating_interactions_for_dogs_with_occupations","235916532_Exploring_Interspecies_Sensemaking_Dog_Tracking_Semiotics_and_Multispecies_Ethnography","233775496_Word_Generalization_by_a_Dog_Canis_familiaris_Is_Shape_Important","220382477_Animal-computer_interaction_A_manifesto","220141745_A_mobile_pet_wearable_computer_and_mixed_reality_system_for_human-poultry_interaction_through_the_internet","202165710_Affordance_conventions_and_design","20669235_Color_vision_in_dog","2927427_User_Interface_Design_as_Systems_Design","329319844_Canine_ergonomics_the_science_of_working_dogs","311490434_Designing_an_emergency_communication_system_for_human_and_assistance_dog_partnerships","307534272_The_theory_of_affordances","301758280_Balancing_Noise_Sensitivity_Response_Latency_and_Posture_Accuracy_for_a_Computer-Assisted_Canine_Posture_Training_System","300725776_Re-Centering_Multispecies_Practices","273947524_Interaction_Design_Beyond_Human-Computer_Interaction","270819200_The_Design_of_Everyday_Things","248912640_Negotiating_Psycho-emotional_Dimensions_of_Disability_and_their_Influence_on_Identity_Constructions","247958271_The_psychology_of_everyday_things_Basic_Books_Inc","220690994_User_interface_design","200086019_The_Design_of_Everyday_Things","51293271_Hearing_in_the_dog_as_assessed_by_auditory-evoked_potentials","31737393_Interaction_design_beyond_human-computer_interaction","9022466_The_Use_of_Service_Dogs_as_an_Adaptive_Strategy_A_Qualitative_Study","7406628_Observations_on_Assistance_Dog_Training_and_Use"]}
