{"id":"258140631_The_development_of_computer_science_research_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China_2000-2009_A_bibliometric_study","abstract":"This paper reports a bibliometric study of the development of computer science research in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in the 21st century, using data from the Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports and CORE databases. Focusing on the areas of data mining, operating systems and web design, it is shown that whilst the productivity of Chinese research has risen dramatically over the period under review, its impact is still low when compared with established scientific nations such as the USA, the UK and Japan. The publication and citation data for China are compared with corresponding data for the other three BRIC nations (Brazil, Russian and India). It is shown that China dominates the BRIC nations in terms of both publications and citations, but that Indian publications often have a greater individual impact.","authors":["Zhilong Xie","Peter Willett"],"meta":["August 2013Information Development 29(3):251-264","DOI:10.1177/0266666912458515"],"references":["268265900_Comparative_analysis_of_scientific_output_of_BRIC_countries","267966386_Indian_Computer_Science_Research_Output_during_1999-2008_Qualitative_Analysis","251574655_Bibliometric_analysis_of_CiteSeer_data_for_countries","241700404_Interpretations_and_misinterpretations_of_scientometric_data_in_the_report_of_the_Royal_Society_about_the_scientific_landscape_in_2011","241698823_Bibliometric_analysis_of_Chinese_superconductivity_research_1986-2007","241628177_Comparing_the_Scientific_Impact_of_Conference_and_Journal_Publications_in_Computer_Science","234144770_As_we_may_search-Comparison_of_major_features_of_the_Web_of_Science_Scopus_and_Google_Scholar_citation-based_and_citation-enhanced_databases","226279627_A_macro_study_of_self-citation","224265177_Unseen_science_Representation_of_BRICs_in_global_science","222436147_The_Emergence_of_China_as_a_Leading_Nation_in_Science_Research_Policy_351_2006_83-104","220435171_Impact_of_data_sources_on_citation_counts_and_rankings_of_LIS_faculty_Web_of_Science_Scopus_and_Google_Scholar_Journal_of_American_Society_for_Information_Science_and_Technology_5813_2105-2125","220424459_Relative_status_of_journal_and_conference_publications_in_Computer_Science","220365270_Modeling_the_growth_of_Indian_and_Chinese_liquid_crystals_literature_as_reflected_in_Science_Citation_Index_1997-2006","220365250_Scientometrics_of_computer_science_research_in_India_and_China","220365100_Scientific_production_in_Computer_Science_A_comparative_study_of_Brazil_and_other_countries","220365050_Which_h-index-A_comparison_of_WoS_Scopus_and_Google_Scholar","220365031_Research_groups_of_oncology_co-authorship_network_in_China","220364983_Performance_evaluation_of_research_universities_in_Mainland_China_Hong_Kong_and_Taiwan_Based_on_a_two-dimensional_approach","220364848_Unseen_Science_Representation_of_the_BRICs_in_Global_Science","220364665_Brazilian_computer_science_research_Gender_and_regional_distributions","220364548_Mapping_of_Indian_computer_science_research_output_1999-2008","220364363_Mapping_knowledge_domains_of_Chinese_digital_library_research_output_1994-2010","220207639_The_plausibility_of_computing_the_h-index_of_scholarly_productivity_and_impact_using_reference-enhanced_databases","51943788_World_Shares_of_Publications_of_the_USA_EU-27_and_China_Compared_andPredicted_using_the_New_Interface_of_the_Web-of-Science_versus_Scopus","46429581_Is_China_also_becoming_a_giant_in_social_sciences","40765811_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Chinese_Research_on_Cyclization_MALDI-TOF_and_Antibiotics","24012687_The_use_and_misuse_of_journal_metrics_and_other_citation_indicators","281538925_Scholarly_Communication_and_Bibliometrics","271995621_Google_Scholar's_Dramatic_Coverage_Improvement_Five_Years_after_Debut","243462284_Quality_versus_quantity_Contradictions_in_LIS_journal_publishing_in_China","242916329_Contribution_of_Chinese_publications_in_computer_science_A_case_study_on_LNCS","241078923_Google_Scholar's_Dramatic_Coverage_Improvement_Five_Years_after_Debut","230875670_A_Quantitative_Evaluation_of_the_Relative_Status_of_Journal_and_Conference_Publications_in_Computer_Science","227640677_Revisiting_h_measured_on_UK_LIS_and_IR_academics","226440380_A_compendium_of_issues_for_citation_analysis","225955626_Comparison_and_evaluation_of_Chinese_research_performance_in_the_field_of_bioinformatics","225759827_Scientific_research_competitiveness_of_world_universities_in_computer_science","224333279_Thirty_Years_of_Computer_Science_Developments_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China_1956-1985","222589161_Informetrics_at_the_Beginning_of_the_21st_Century_-_a_Review","221305913_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Data_Mining_in_the_Chinese_Social_Science_Circle","220365116_A_comparative_study_of_research_performance_in_computer_science","220365058_History_of_the_journal_impact_factor_Contingencies_and_consequences","220364707_Regional_development_and_interregional_collaboration_in_the_growth_of_nanotechnology_research_in_China","220262992_Clustal_W_and_Clustal_X_version_20","220141989_Citation_Analysis","27226055_Trends_in_the_Usage_of_ISI_Bibliometric_Data_Uses_Abuses_and_Implications","7492196_An_Index_to_Quantify_An_Individual's_Scientific_Research_Output","7380639_The_History_and_Meaning_of_the_Journal_Impact_Factor","5994547_Clustal_W_and_Clustal_X_Version_20","3331098_Founding_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences'_Institute_of_Computing_Technology","3330708_Computers_in_Russia_Science_education_and_industry","3330707_Computer_science_in_Russia_A_personal_view"]}
