{"id":"286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been established as a powerful class of models for image recognition problems. Encouraged by these results, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation of CNNs on large-scale video classification using a new dataset of 1 million YouTube videos belonging to 487 classes. We study multiple approaches for extending the connectivity of a CNN in time domain to take advantage of local spatio-temporal information and suggest a multiresolution, foveated architecture as a promising way of speeding up the training. Our best spatio-temporal networks display significant performance improvements compared to strong feature-based baselines (55.3% to 63.9%), but only a surprisingly modest improvement compared to single-frame models (59.3% to 60.9%). We further study the generalization performance of our best model by retraining the top layers on the UCF-101 Action Recognition dataset and observe significant performance improvements compared to the UCF-101 baseline model (63.3% up from 43.9%).","authors":["Andrej Karpathy","George Toderici","Sanketh Shetty","Thomas Leung"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2014.223","Conference: 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)"],"references":["261100864_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_An_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition","259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks","240308781_Learning_Hierarchical_Features_for_Scene_Labeling","234131118_Indoor_Semantic_Segmentation_using_depth_information","233815759_UCF101_A_Dataset_of_101_Human_Actions_Classes_From_Videos_in_The_Wild","224579268_Recognizing_realistic_actions_from_videos_in_the_Wild","221620711_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","221304534_Modeling_Temporal_Structure_of_Decomposable_Motion_Segments_for_Activity_Classification","216792694_Convolutional_Learning_of_Spatio-temporal_Features","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","283259046_Sequential_Deep_Learning_for_Human_Action_Recognition","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","267709055_Deep_Neural_Networks_Segment_Neuronal_Membranes_in_Electron_Microscopy_Images","258424423_Visualizing_and_Understanding_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","226678977_On_Space-Time_Interest_Points","224744237_Video_Google_A_Text_Retrieval_Approach_to_Object_Matching_in_Videos","224254831_Appendix_Learning_Hierarchical_Invariant_Spatio-Temporal_Features_for_Action_Recognition_with_Independent_Subspace_Analysis","221363905_Discriminative_Tag_Learning_on_YouTube_Videos_with_Latent_Sub-tags_DRAFT","221361842_Learning_Realistic_Human_Actions_from_Movies","221346417_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Human_Action_Recognition","221259353_Evaluation_of_Local_Spatio-temporal_Features_for_Action_Recognition","220660153_A_Statistical_Approach_to_Texture_Classification_from_Single_Images","51025101_Action_Recognition_by_Dense_Trajectories","4210181_Behavior_recognition_via_sparse_spatio-temporal_features"]}
