{"id":"324638784_Structural_Displacement_Monitoring_Using_Smartphone_Camera_and_Digital_Image_Correlation","abstract":"Smartphones, which houses various onboard sensors and a camera, can be leveraged for structural health monitoring (SHM). In this study, an iPhoneâ€™s camera coupled with a custom iOS app, D-Viewer, is employed for 3D structural displacement monitoring. Based on the digital image correlation technique, the camera is used to track a circular target, and the app determines its in-plane, out-of-plane and arbitrary direction displacements within the field of view. A series of static and dynamic experiments is conducted to validate the proposed technique.","authors":["Niannian Wang","Kwang Ri","Hao Liu","Xuefeng Zhao"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE Sensors Journal PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JSEN.2018.2828139","Project: Cloud Structural Health Monitoring Based on Smartphones"],"references":["312314255_Image_Correlation_Technique_for_Strain_Measurement_An_Overview","305454572_Emergency_Communication_and_Quick_Seismic_Damage_Investigation_Based_on_Smartphone","282421357_Portable_and_convenient_cable_force_measurement_using_smartphone","276831002_Initial_Validation_of_Mobile-Structural_Health_Monitoring_Method_Using_Smartphones","265519644_Fatigue_Growth_Analysis_of_Pre_Induced_Surface_Defects_Using_Piezoelectric_Wafer_Based_Impedance_Method_and_Digital_Image_Correlation_System","262253388_On_measuring_mechanical_oscillations_using_smartphone_sensors_Possibilities_and_limitation","260662472_Mobile_Phones_as_Seismologic_Sensors_Automating_Data_Extraction_for_the_iShake_System","224222673_Movement_recognition_using_the_accelerometer_in_smartphones","224190337_Supporting_patient_monitoring_using_activity_recognition_with_a_smartphone","223407248_Comparison_of_laser_Doppler_vibrometer_with_contact_sensors_for_monitoring_bridge_deflection_and_vibration","221652263_Fall_and_emergency_detection_with_mobile_phones","311167989_Emergency_Communication_and_Quick_Seismic_Damage_Investigation_Based_on_Smartphone","302595091_Displacement_Monitoring_Technique_using_a_Smartphone_Based_on_the_Laser_Projection-Sensing_Method","298340336_Improved_crack_monitoring_in_structural_concrete_by_combined_acoustic_emission_and_digital_image_correlation_techniques","273939709_Damage_detection_and_full_surface_characterization_of_a_wind_turbine_blade_using_three-dimensional_digital_image_correlation","257422276_Vision-based_displacement_measurement_method_for_high-rise_building_structures_using_partitioning_approach","252593958_Structural_Health_Monitoring_of_Helicopter_Hard_Landing_using_3D_Digital_Image_Correlation","245560276_Pile_Monitoring_with_Fiber_Optic_Sensors_During_Axial_Compression_Pullout_and_Flexure_Tests","245291822_Modeling_Terrestrial_Laser_Scanner_Data_for_Precise_Structural_Deformation_Measurement","245291604_Dynamic_Deformation_Monitoring_of_Tall_Structure_Using_GPS_Technology","231017086_A_vision-based_approach_for_the_direct_measurement_of_displacements_in_vibrating_systems","223825567_Measurement_of_deflections_and_of_oscillation_frequencies_of_engineering_structures_using_Robotic_Theodolites_RTS","222316075_The_Determination_of_Bridge_Displacement_Using_Measured_Acceleration","220373604_A_New_Approach_for_Health_Monitoring_of_Structures_Terrestrial_Laser_Scanning"]}
