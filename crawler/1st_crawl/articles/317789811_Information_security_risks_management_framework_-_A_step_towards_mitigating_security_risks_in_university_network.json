{"id":"317789811_Information_security_risks_management_framework_-_A_step_towards_mitigating_security_risks_in_university_network","abstract":"Information is one of the most prominent assets for Universities and must be protected from security breach. This paper analyzed the security threats specifically evolve in University's network, and with consideration of these issues, proposed information security framework for University network environment. The proposed framework reduces the risk of security breach by supporting three phase activities; the first phase assesses the threats and vulnerabilities in order to identify the weak point in educational environment, the second phase focuses on the highest risk and create actionable remediation plan, the third phase of risk assessment model recognizes the vulnerability management compliance requirement in order to improve University's security position. The proposed framework is applied on Vikram University Ujjain India's, computing environment and the evaluation result showed the proposed framework enhances the security level of University campus network. This model can be used by risk analyst and security manager of University to perform reliable and repeatable risk analysis in realistic and affordable manner.","authors":["Chanchala Joshi","Umesh Kumar Singh"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Information Security and Applications 35:128-137","DOI:10.1016/j.jisa.2017.06.006"],"references":["311809961_Quantifying_Security_Risk_by_Critical_Network_Vulnerabilities_Assessment","305968110_Performance_Evaluation_of_Web_Application_Security_Scanners_for_More_Effective_Defense","305430031_A_Review_on_Taxonomies_of_Attacks_and_Vulnerability_in_Computer_and_Network_System","305361919_Security_Testing_and_Assessment_of_Vulnerability_Scanners_in_Quest_of_Current_Information_Security_Landscape","281583879_Cross_Site_Request_Forgery_Preventive_Measures","277180688_Preventing_Input_Type_Validation_Vulnerabilities_Using_Network_Based_Intrusion_Detection_Systems","269670003_ADMIT-_A_Five_Dimensional_Approach_towards_Standardization_of_Network_and_Computer_Attack_Taxonomies","258651977_Preventing_SQL_Injection_Attacks","311677980_Information_Security_Assessment_by_Quantifying_Risk_Level_of_Network_Vulnerabilities"]}
