{"id":"326202525_A_Deep_Modular_RNN_Approach_for_Ethos_Mining","abstract":"Automatically recognising and extracting the reasoning expressed in natural language text is extremely demanding and only very recently has there been significant headway. While such argument mining focuses on logos (the content of what is said) evidence has demonstrated that using ethos (the character of the speaker) can sometimes be an even more powerful tool of influence. We study the UK parliamentary debates which furnish a rich source of ethos with linguistic material signalling the ethotic relationships between politicians. We then develop a novel deep modular recurrent neural network, DMRNN, approach and employ proven methods from argument mining and sentiment analysis to create an ethos mining pipeline. Annotation of ethotic statements is reliable and its extraction is robust (macro-F1 = 0.83), while annotation of polarity is perfect and its extraction is solid (macro-F1 = 0.84). By exploring correspondences between ethos in political discourse and major events in the political landscape through ethos analytics, we uncover tantalising evidence that identifying expressions of positive and negative ethotic sentiment is a powerful instrument for understanding the dynamics of governments.","authors":["Rory Duthie","Katarzyna Budzynska"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.24963/ijcai.2018/562","Conference: Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence {IJCAI-18}","Project: ArgDiaP"],"references":[]}
