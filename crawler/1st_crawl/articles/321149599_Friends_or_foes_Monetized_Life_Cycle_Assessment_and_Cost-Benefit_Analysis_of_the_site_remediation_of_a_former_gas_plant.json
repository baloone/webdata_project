Every contaminated site has its own specific characteristics and the increased availability and efficiency of remediation techniques makes the choice of remediation alternative increasingly complicated. In this paper an attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the secondary environmental impacts of a site remediation is performed and its results are monetized using two different monetization techniques, namely Stepwise 2006 and Ecovalue 08. Secondly, we perform a social Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) on the same case study using the same data sources. The case study used in this paper entails the soil and groundwater remediation of a tar, poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and cyanide contamination of a school ground by a former gas plant. The remediation alternative chosen in this case study is excavation with off-site thermal treatment of the contaminated soil. The outcome of the social CBA, stating that the remediation project is socially beneficial in the long term, is critically compared to the outcome of the different LCA monetization methods. This comparison indicates that monetized LCA is a good complement to social CBA when it comes to the assessment of secondary environmental impacts. Combining the two methods provides decision makers with a more extensive and detailed assessment of the soil remediation project.","authors":["Lies Huysegoms","Sandra Rousseau","Val√©rie Cappuyns"],"meta":["November 2017Science of The Total Environment 619-620:258-271","DOI:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.330"],"references":["336444374_Progress_in_the_management_of_Contaminated_Sites_in_Europe_2014","318038544_Cost-benefit_analysis_of_copper_recovery_in_remediation_projects_A_case_study_from_Sweden","300423649_Life_Cycle_Assessment_of_activated_carbon_production_from_coconut_shells","271826521_Estimating_residents'_willingness_to_pay_for_groundwater_protection_in_the_Vietnamese_Mekong_Delta","266204363_Monetary_valuation_in_Life_Cycle_Assessment_A_review","259934714_Environmental_Improvement_Potentials_of_Meat_and_Dairy_Products_EUR_23491","257348904_Environmental_impact_associated_with_activated_carbon_preparation_from_olive-waste_cake_via_life_cycle_assessment","248398132_Contaminated_Sites_in_Europe_Review_of_the_Current_Situation_Based_on_Data_Collected_through_a_European_Network","233150649_Valuation_of_Market_uncertainties_for_contaminated_land","229307027_Economic_valuation_of_air_pollution_mortality_A_9-country_contingent_valuation_survey_of_value_of_a_life_year_VOLY","225889798_Economic_benefits_of_large-scale_remediation_of_contaminated_marine_sediments-a_literature_review_and_an_application_to_the_Grenland_fjords_in_Norway","225530233_Life_cycle_assessment_of_soil_and_groundwater_remediation_technologies_Literature_review","221914794_Cost-Benefit_Analysis_of_the_Clean-Up_of_Hazardous_Waste_Sites","7421201_Aerobic_Mineralization_of_Trichloroethylene_Vinyl_Chloride_and_Aromatic_Compounds_by_Rhodococcus_Species","7330328_Environmental_costs_of_mercury_pollution","299030436_Cost-benefit_analysis_and_the_environment","289367503_Cost-benefit_calculation_of_phytoremediation_technology_for_heavy-metal-contaminated_soil","286351022_The_Ethics_and_Politics_of_Environmental_Cost-Benefit_Analysis","275413346_Cost-benefit_analysis_as_a_part_of_sustainability_assessment_of_remediation_alternatives_for_contaminated_land","269878144_Removal_of_organic_compounds_from_water_Life_cycle_environmental_impacts_and_economic_costs_of_the_Arvia_process_compared_to_granulated_activated_carbon","269175069_Is_phytoremediation_without_biomass_valorization_sustainable_-_Comparative_LCA_of_landfilling_vs_anaerobic_co-digestion","264469202_Cost-benefit_analysis_of_soil_remediation_in_Israeli_industrial_zones","262569507_Bridging_the_gap_between_LCA_LCC_and_CBA_as_sustainability_assessment_tools","257698325_Applying_a_multi-criteria_genetic_algorithm_framework_for_brownfield_reuse_optimization_Improving_redevelopment_options_based_on_stakeholder_preferences","257680087_Life_cycle_assessment_in_green_chemistry_Overview_of_key_parameters_and_methodological_concerns","257680032_Statistical_analysis_for_the_development_of_national_average_weighting_factors-visualization_of_the_variability_between_each_individual's_environmental_thought","257679726_Life_cycle_assessment_of_polychlorinated_biphenyl_contaminated_soil_remediation_processes","256684296_The_Economics_of_Climate_Change_The_Stern_Review","251623699_Ecovalue08-A_new_valuation_set_for_environmental_systems_analysis_tools","250840707_Quenching_of_the_3_B_1u_1_A_1g_emission_of_benzene_in_low_temperature_matrices_at_10_K","246960689_Weighting_in_LCA_Based_on_Ecotaxes_-_Development_of_a_Midpoint_Method_and_Experiences_from_Case_Studies","239360346_Study_of_the_environmental_impacts_based_on_the_green_tax_-_Applied_to_several_types_of_building_materials","232810829_Applications_of_life_cycle_assessment_and_cost_analysis_in_health_care_waste_management","227591970_How_costly_is_clean_An_analysis_of_the_benefits_and_costs_of_Superfund_site_remediations","226763690_Weighting_across_safeguard_subjects_for_LCIA_through_the_application_of_conjoint_analysis","225527720_Economic_Allocation_in_LCA_A_Case_Study_About_Aluminium_Window_Frames","223321414_Biofuel_or_excavation_-_Life_cycle_assessment_LCA_of_soil_remediation_options","222036936_Reducing_soil_contamination_Economic_incentives_and_potential_benefits","47697972_Environmental_Impacts_of_Remediation_of_a_Trichloroethene-Contaminated_Site_Life_Cycle_Assessment_of_Remediation_Alternatives","47678714_Designing_sustainable_and_economically_attractive_brownfield_revitalization_options_using_an_integrated_assessment_model","46490480_Using_the_budget_constraint_to_monetise_impact_assessment_results","44570045_Does_remediation_save_lives_On_the_cost_of_cleaning_up_arsenic-contaminated_sites_in_Sweden","40678530_Life-Cycle_Case_Study_Comparison_of_Permeable_Reactive_Barrier_versus_Pump-and-Treat_Remediation","7842805_Economical_and_ecological_comparison_of_granular_activated_carbon_GAC_adsorber_refill_strategies"]}
