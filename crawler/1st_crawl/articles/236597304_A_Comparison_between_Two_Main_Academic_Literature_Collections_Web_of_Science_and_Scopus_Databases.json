In which aspects these two databases are similar? Or, if\nthe researchers are forced to choose one of them, which one should they prefer?\nFor answering these questions, these two databases will be compared based on\ntheir qualitative and quantitative characteristics.","authors":["Arezoo aghaei chadegani","Hadi Salehi","Melor Md.
