{"id":"332352333_A_25D_approach_to_skin_wrinkles_segmentation","abstract":"Wrinkles or creases are common structures on surfaces. Their detection is often challenging, and can be an important step for many different applications. For instance, skin wrinkle segmentation is a crucial step for quantifying changes in skin wrinkling and assessing the beneficial effects of dermatological and cosmetic anti-ageing treatments. A 2.5D approach is proposed in this paper to segment individual wrinkles on facial skin surface described by 3D point clouds. The method, based on mathematical morphology, only needs a few physical parameters as input, namely the maximum wrinkle width, the minimum wrinkle length, and the minimum wrinkle depth. It has been applied to data acquired from eye wrinkles using a fringe projection system. An accurate evaluation was made possible thanks to manual annotations provided by three different experts. Results demonstrate the accuracy of this novel method.","authors":["Etienne Decenci√®re","Amira Belhedi","Serge Koudoro","Frederic Flament"],"meta":["April 2019Image Analysis and Stereology 38(1):75","DOI:10.5566/ias.1925","Project: Instrumental In Vivo Methods"],"references":["268882245_Fast_detection_of_facial_wrinkles_based_on_Gabor_features_using_image_morphology_and_geometric_constraints","262359069_Modeling_and_Detection_of_Wrinkles_in_Aging_Human_Faces_Using_Marked_Point_Processes","260382037_Parsimonious_Path_Openings_and_Closings","224545377_Point_cloud_segmentation_towards_urban_ground_modeling","258851565_Quantification_of_Age-Related_Facial_Wrinkles_in_Men_and_Women_Using_a_Three-Dimensional_Fringe_Projection_Method_and_Validated_Assessment_Scales","242421059_Age_classification_form_facial_images","237001165_Comparison_of_Validated_Assessment_Scales_and_3D_digital_fringe_projection_method_to_assess_lifetime_development_of_wrinkles_in_men","230837938_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Drainage_Network_Extraction_on_DEMs","225299838_Assessing_Facial_Wrinkles_Automatic_Detection_and_Quantification","224378045_Segmentation_and_Classification_of_Range_Images"]}
