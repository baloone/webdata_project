{"id":"330169734_ha_An_index_to_quantify_an_individual's_scientific_leadership","abstract":"The \\(\\alpha\\) person is the dominant person in a group. We define the \\(\\alpha\\)-author of a paper as the author of the paper with the highest h-index among all the coauthors, and an \\(\\alpha\\)-paper of a scientist as a paper authored or coauthored by the scientist where he/she is the \\(\\alpha\\)-author. For most but not all papers in the literature there is only one \\(\\alpha\\)-author. We define the \\(h_\\alpha\\) index of a scientist as the number of papers in the h-core of the scientist (i.e. the set of papers that contribute to the h-index of the scientist) where this scientist is the \\(\\alpha\\)-author. We also define the \\(h'_\\alpha\\) index of a scientist as the number of \\(\\alpha\\)-papers of this scientist that have \\(\\ge\\) \\(h'_\\alpha\\) citations. \\(h_\\alpha\\) and \\(h'_\\alpha\\) contain similar information, while \\(h'_\\alpha\\) is conceptually more appealing it is harder to obtain from existing databases, hence of less current practical interest. We propose that the \\(h_\\alpha\\) and/or \\(h'_\\alpha\\) indices, or other variants discussed in the paper, are useful complements to the h-index of a scientist to quantify his/her scientific achievement, that rectify an inherent drawback of the h-index, its inability to distinguish between authors with different coauthorships patterns. A high h index in conjunction with a high \\(h_\\alpha /h\\) ratio is a hallmark of scientific leadership.","authors":["J. E.
