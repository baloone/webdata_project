{"id":"327137299_Sub-200_fs_soliton_mode-locked_fiber_laser_based_on_bismuthene_saturable_absorber","abstract":"Few-layer bismuthene is an emerging two-dimensional material in the fields of physics, chemistry, and material. However, its nonlinear optical property and the related photonics device is few studied so far. Here, we demonstrate a sub-200 fs soliton modelocked erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) using a microfiber-based bismuthene saturable absorber for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. The bismuthene nanosheets are synthesized by the sonochemical exfoliation method and transferred onto the taper region of a microfiber by the optical deposition method. Stable soliton pulses centered at 1561 nm with the shortest pulse duration of about 193 fs were obtained. Our findings unambiguously imply that apart from its fantastic electric and thermal property, few-layer bismuthene may also possess attractive optoelectronic property for nonlinear photonics, such as mode-locker, Qswitcher, optical modulator and so on.","authors":["Bo Guo","Shi-Hao Wang","Zhi-Xin Wu","Ze-Xin Wang"],"meta":["September 2018Optics Express 26(18):22750-22760","DOI:10.1364/OE.26.022750","Projects: Broadband saturable absorption mechanism of bismuthene and its application in mid-infrared ultrafast fiber laser | 铋烯的宽带饱和吸收机制及其在中红外超快光纤激光器中的应用 (NSFH JJ2019LH1509)Mode-locked 3-5 μm mid-infrared fiber Raman laser with topological insulator | 拓扑绝缘体锁模的3-5 μm中红外光纤拉曼激光器 (6140414040116CB01012)"],"references":["322628375_2D_noncarbon_materials-based_nonlinear_optical_devices_for_ultrafast_photonics_Invited","316956321_Spatiotemporal_mode-locking_in_multimode_fiber_lasers","323270512_Epitaxial_Growth_of_Flat_Antimonene_Monolayer_A_New_Honeycomb_Analogue_of_Graphene","323179531_Excellent_nonlinear_absorption_properties_of_b-antimonene_nanosheets","322685911_Passively_mode-locked_Er-doped_fiber_laser_based_on_SnS_2_nanosheets_as_a_saturable_absorber","320632402_All-Optical_Switching_of_Two_Continuous_Waves_in_Few_Layer_Bismuthene_Based_on_Spatial_Cross-Phase_Modulation","320459242_Passively_Q-switched_erbium-doped_fiber_laser_based_on_SnS_2_saturable_absorber","320043347_Few-layer_Bismuthene_Sonochemical_Exfoliation_Nonlinear_Optics_and_Applications_for_Ultrafast_Photonics_with_Enhanced_Stability","319251579_Few-layer_antimonene_decorated_microfiber_Ultra-short_pulse_generation_and_all-optical_thresholding_with_enhanced_long_term_stability","318147281_Broadband_Nonlinear_Optical_Response_in_Few-Layer_Antimonene_and_Antimonene_Quantum_Dots_A_Promising_Optical_Kerr_Media_with_Enhanced_Stability"]}
