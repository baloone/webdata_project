Rapidly evolution of technology recently, leads to increase the intruderâ€™s ability and a main challenge to information security. Therefore, utilizing the non-traditional basics for information security is required, such as DNA which is focused as a new aspect to achieve better security. In this paper, a survey of more recent DNA based on data hiding algorithms are covered. With particular emphasis of different parameters several data hiding algorithms based on DNA has been reviewed. To present a more secure an efficient data hiding algorithms based on DNA for future works, this willbe helpful. </p","authors":["Nichirvan Asaad Zebari","Dilovan Zebari","Diyar Zeebaree","Jwan Najeeb Saeed"],"meta":["January 2021Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 21(1)","DOI:10.11591/ijeecs.v21.i1.pp338-347"],"references":["328610899_Data_Hiding_by_Image_Steganography_Appling_DNA_Sequence_Arithmetic","324201164_Design_and_Implementation_of_Advanced_Encryption_Standard_Security_Algorithm_using_FPGA","322626806_Security_Issues_in_DNA_Based_on_Data_Hiding_A_Review","322557949_A_review_of_data_compression_techniques","345233637_Amino_Acids_in_Data_Encryption","339101082_A_Simultaneous_Approach_for_Compression_and_Encryption_Techniques_Using_Deoxyribonucleic_Acid","338679633_DNA_QR_coding_for_data_security_using_DNA_sequence","338350416_Towards_DNA_based_data_security_in_the_cloud_computing_environment","334372234_A_Data_Hiding_Approach_Based_on_Reference-Affected_Matrix","334303372_Data_Compression_Using_Shannon-Fano_Algorithm"]}
