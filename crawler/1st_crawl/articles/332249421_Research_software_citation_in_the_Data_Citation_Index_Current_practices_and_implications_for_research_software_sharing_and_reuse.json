{"id":"332249421_Research_software_citation_in_the_Data_Citation_Index_Current_practices_and_implications_for_research_software_sharing_and_reuse","abstract":"The aim of this study is to explore the phenomenon of research software citation and, in particular, to draw attention to the increasing importance of this form of citation in scholarly communication. This research sheds light on the current status of formal software citation that is captured by citation databases. Data for the study were gathered from more than 67,000 research software records available in public repositories indexed by Clarivate Analytics' Data Citation Index (DCI). The metadata characteristics of the indexed records and citation data were then analyzed. Research software was rarely cited in the DCI, suggesting that the documented reuse of research software rarely occurs or is not well documented. Institutional repositories attracted few citations and had low rate of citation. It proved impossible, however, using the available data to isolate specific identifiers that can promote formal software citation. The findings presented here offer insights into research software citation that will be of interest to funding agencies, publishers, researchers, and research organizations.","authors":["Hyoungjoo Park","Dietmar Wolfram"],"meta":["May 2019Journal of Informetrics 13(2):574-582","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2019.03.005"],"references":["325269624_How_important_is_scientific_software_in_bioinformatics_research_A_comparative_study_between_international_and_Chinese_research_communities","314500591_A_Data_Citation_Roadmap_for_Scientific_Publishers","311939663_Software_citation_reuse_and_metadata_considerations_An_exploratory_study_examining_LAMMPS","311749761_Citations_for_Software_Providing_Identification_Access_and_Recognition_for_Research_Software","311704760_Software_vs_data_in_the_context_of_citation","310615183_Software_citation_principles","307643409_Transitive_Credit_and_JSON-LD","305339362_Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Taking_Advantage_of_Git_and_GitHub","281767581_Best_publishing_practices_to_improve_user_confidence_in_scientific_software","263847351_Transitive_Credit_as_a_Means_to_Address_Social_and_Technological_Concerns_Stemming_from_Citation_and_Attribution_of_Digital_Products","254666888_The_Anatomy_of_a_Data_Citation_Discovery_Reuse_and_Credit","239525631_BioNerDS_Exploring_bioinformatics'_database_and_software_use_through_literature_mining","221560692_Software_is_data_too","326688816_Informal_data_citation_for_data_sharing_and_reuse_is_more_common_than_formal_data_citation_in_biomedical_fields","324674760_Examining_the_usage_citation_and_diffusion_patterns_of_bibliometric_mapping_software_A_comparative_study_of_three_tools","320148994_How_is_R_cited_in_research_outputs_Structure_impacts_and_citation_standard","313123049_An_examination_of_research_data_sharing_and_re-use_implications_for_data_citation_practice","291437595_The_Challenge_and_Promise_of_Software_Citation_for_Credit_Identification_Discovery_and_Reuse","290950355_Paratexts_and_documentary_practices_Text_mining_authorship_and_acknowledgment_from_a_bioinformatics_corpus","282936072_Assessing_the_impact_of_software_on_science_A_bootstrapped_learning_of_software_entities_in_full-text_papers","276364280_Software_in_the_scientific_literature_Problems_with_seeing_finding_and_using_software_mentioned_in_the_biology_literature","276065918_AppCiter_A_Web_Application_for_Increasing_Rates_and_Accuracy_of_Scientific_Software_Citation","265130918_Better_Software_Better_Research","226169422_Developing_a_Metadata_Application_Profile_for_Sharing_Agricultural_Scientific_and_Scholarly_Research_Resources","221855369_The_case_for_open_computer_programs","220426859_Assessing_Open_Source_Software_as_a_Scholarly_Contribution"]}
