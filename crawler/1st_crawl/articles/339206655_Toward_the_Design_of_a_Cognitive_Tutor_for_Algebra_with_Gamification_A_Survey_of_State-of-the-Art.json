{"id":"339206655_Toward_the_Design_of_a_Cognitive_Tutor_for_Algebra_with_Gamification_A_Survey_of_State-of-the-Art","abstract":"A cognitive tutor is a kind of intelligent tutoring system, which is\nparticularly focused on providing individualized support for the improvement\nof complex cognitive abilities through the practice of problem resolution. The\ndevelopment of a cognitive tutor involves the analysis of diverse strategies and\ntheories related both to computer science and to pedagogy, as well as the analysis of models related to the discipline in which the tutor will be used. In this\npaper, an analysis of the state of the art of the topics that have been identified as\nnecessary for the design of a cognitive tutor with gamification to support students with the solving of algebraic problems is conducted. Whenever we talk\nabout an intelligent tutor, models capable of simulating decision making, such\nas fuzzy models, are required; thus, they are also considered for this analysis.\nAdditionally, comparison tables that allow the identification of opportunity areas for the development of solutions to problems that haven’t been thoroughly\ncovered in the literature are presented.","authors":["Blanca-Estela Pedroza-MÉndez","Juan Manuel Gonzalez Calleros","Josefina Guerrero García","Carlos-Alberto Reyes-García"],"meta":["December 2017Research in Computing Science 145(1):69-80","DOI:10.13053/rcs-145-1-5"],"references":["329988511_Metacognition_Motivation_and_Emotions_Contribution_of_Self-Regulated_Learning_to_Solving_Mathematical_Problems","309452444_Integrating_Virtual_Worlds_with_Tangible_User_Interfaces_for_Teaching_Mathematics_A_Pilot_Study","304455879_The_Impact_of_Game-Like_Features_on_Learning_from_an_Intelligent_Tutoring_System","339206021_Evocacion_de_habitos_en_personajes_virtuales_mediante_Mapas_Cognitivos_Difusos_y_tecnicas_de_videojuegos","333103060_Incremental_Dynamic_Case_Based_Reasoning_and_Multi-Agent_Systems_IDCBR-MAS_for_Intelligent_Tutoring_System","315467356_Personalized_Adaptive_Learner_Model_in_E-Learning_System_Using_FCM_and_Fuzzy_Inference_System","309261445_The_evaluation_of_the_cognitive_learning_process_of_the_renewed_bloom_taxonomy_using_a_web_based_expert_system","303689290_Teaching_Real-World_Problem_Solving_in_School_Mathematics_A_Multiple-Perspective_Framework","301677070_Using_Bayesian_Networks_for_Knowledge_Representation_and_Evaluation_in_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","299717662_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_Measuring_Student's_Effort_During_Assessment"]}
