{"id":"220110803_Online_algorithms_for_the_general_k-search_problem","abstract":"This paper investigates the general k-search problem, in which a player is to sell totally k units of some asset within n periods, aiming at maximizing the total revenue. At each period, the player observes a quoted price which expires before the next period, and decides irrecoverably the amount of the asset to be sold at the price. We present a deterministic online algorithm and prove it optimal for the case where k⩽n−1. For the other case where k⩾n, we show by numerical illustration that the gap between the upper and the lower bound of competitive ratio is quite small for many situations.","authors":["Wenming Zhang","Yinfeng Xu","Feifeng Zheng","Ming Liu"],"meta":["July 2011Information Processing Letters 111(14):678-682","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2011.04.008","SourceDBLP"],"references":["234784007_Amortized_efficiency_of_list_update_paging_rules","225453208_Optimal_Search_and_One-Way_Trading_Online_Algorithms","225264214_Optimal_Algorithms_for_k-Search_with_Application_in_Option_Pricing","225114268_Average-Case_Competitive_Analyses_for_One-Way_Trading","225109558_Optimal_Algorithms_for_the_Online_Time_Series_Search_Problem","221444860_Competitive_Algorithms_for_VWAP_and_Limit_Order_Trading","221427283_Average-Case_Competitive_Analyses_for_One-Way_Trading","221335288_Optimal_Algorithms_for_the_Online_Time_Series_Search_Problem","220223579_Online_Search_with_Time-Varying_Price_Bounds","220154901_Optimal_algorithms_for_the_online_time_series_search_problem"]}
