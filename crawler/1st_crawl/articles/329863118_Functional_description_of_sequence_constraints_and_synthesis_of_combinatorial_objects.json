{"id":"329863118_Functional_description_of_sequence_constraints_and_synthesis_of_combinatorial_objects","abstract":"Contrary to the standard approach consisting in introducing ad hoc constraints and designing dedicated algorithms for handling their combinatorial aspect, this thesis takes another point of view. On the one hand, it focusses on describing a family of sequence constraints in a compositional way by multiple layers of functions. On the other hand, it addresses the combinatorial aspect of both a single constraint and a conjunction of such constraints by synthesising compositional combinatorial objects, namely bounds, linear inequalities, non-linear constraints and finite automata. These objects are obtained in a systematic way and are not instance-specific: they are parameterised by one or several constraints, by the number of variables in a considered sequence of variables, and by the initial domains of the variables. When synthesising such objects we draw full benefit both from the declarative view of such constraints, based on regular expressions, and from the operational view, based on finite transducers and register automata.There are many advantages of synthesising combinatorial objects rather than designing dedicated algorithms: 1) parameterised formulae can be applied in the context of several resolution techniques such as constraint programming or linear programming, whereas algorithms are typically tailored to a specific technique; 2) combinatorial objects can be combined together to provide better performance in practice; 3) finally, the quantities computed by some formulae cannot just be used in an optimisation setting, but also in the context of data mining.","authors":["Ekaterina Arafailova"],"meta":["September 2018"],"references":[]}
