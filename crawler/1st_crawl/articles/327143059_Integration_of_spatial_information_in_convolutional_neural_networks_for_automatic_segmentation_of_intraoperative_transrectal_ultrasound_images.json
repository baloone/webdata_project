{"id":"327143059_Integration_of_spatial_information_in_convolutional_neural_networks_for_automatic_segmentation_of_intraoperative_transrectal_ultrasound_images","abstract":"Image guidance systems that register scans of the prostate obtained using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging are becoming increasingly popular as a means of enabling tumor-targeted prostate cancer biopsy and treatment. However, intraoperative segmentation of TRUS images to define the three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of the prostate remains a necessary task in existing guidance systems, which often require significant manual interaction and are subject to interoperator variability. Therefore, automating this step would lead to more acceptable clinical workflows and greater standardization between different operators and hospitals. In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatically segmenting the prostate in two-dimensional (2-D) TRUS slices of a 3-D TRUS volume was developed and tested. The network was designed to be able to incorporate 3-D spatial information by taking one or more TRUS slices neighboring each slice to be segmented as input, in addition to these slices. The accuracy of the CNN was evaluated on data from a cohort of 109 patients who had undergone TRUS-guided targeted biopsy, (a total of 4034 2-D slices). The segmentation accuracy was measured by calculating 2-D and 3-D Dice similarity coefficients, on the 2-D images and corresponding 3-D volumes, respectively, as well as the 2-D boundary distances, using a 10-fold patient-level cross-validation experiment. However, incorporating neighboring slices did not improve the segmentation performance in five out of six experiment results, which include varying the number of neighboring slices from 1 to 3 at either side. The up-sampling shortcuts reduced the overall training time of the network, 161 min compared with 253 min without the architectural addition.","authors":["Nooshin Ghavami","Yipeng Hu","Ester Bonmati","Rachael Rodell"],"meta":["August 2018Journal of Medical Imaging 6(01):1","DOI:10.1117/1.JMI.6.1.011003"],"references":["319461995_Detection_and_Characterization_of_the_Fetal_Heartbeat_in_Free-hand_Ultrasound_Sweeps_with_Weakly-supervised_Two-streams_Convolutional_Networks","314219855_Convolutional_neural_network_based_deep-learning_architecture_for_prostate_cancer_detection_on_multiparametric_magnetic_resonance_images","313857891_A_Survey_on_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Image_Analysis","311715240_FusionNet_A_Deep_Fully_Residual_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Image_Segmentation_in_Connectomics","311458048_Fine-grained_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Automatic_Prostate_Segmentation_in_Ultrasound_Images","276923248_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","275587332_Posterior_subcapsular_prostate_cancer_Identification_with_mpMRI_and_MRITRUS_fusion-guided_biopsy","261922145_Computer-Aided_Detection_of_Prostate_Cancer_inMRI","259719935_Evaluation_of_prostate_segmentation_algorithms_for_MRI_The_PROMISE12_challenge","256984657_MRI-targeted_prostate_biopsy_A_review_of_technique_and_results","49628567_Adaptively_Learning_Local_Shape_Statistics_for_Prostate_Segmentation_in_Ultrasound","41416495_Discrete_Deformable_Model_Guided_by_Partial_Active_Shape_Model_for_TRUS_Image_Segmentation","326171157_Label-driven_weakly-supervised_learning_for_multimodal_deformable_image_registration","325512119_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Real_Time_Prostate_Segmentation_in_Freehand_Ultrasound_Guided_Biopsy","323718501_Automatic_slice_segmentation_of_intraoperative_transrectal_ultrasound_images_using_convolutional_neural_networks","319461030_Clinical_Target-Volume_Delineation_in_Prostate_Brachytherapy_Using_Residual_Neural_Networks","318560138_The_Devil_is_in_the_Decoder","315936049_MP33-20_THE_SMARTTARGET_BIOPSY_TRIAL_A_PROSPECTIVE_PAIRED_BLINDED_TRIAL_WITH_RANDOMISATION_TO_COMPARE_VISUAL-ESTIMATION_AND_IMAGE-FUSION_TARGETED_PROSTATE_BIOPSIES","314219868_Prostate_Cancer_Diagnosis_using_Deep_Learning_with_3D_Multiparametric_MRI","286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","261444037_Management_of_low_risk_prostate_cancer_Active_surveillance_and_focal_therapy","260432225_Representation_Learning_A_Unified_Deep_Learning_Framework_for_Automatic_Prostate_MR_Segmentation","221401697_Automated_Segmentation_of_3D_US_Prostate_Images_Using_Statistical_Texture-Based_Matching_Method","7254399_Deformable_segmentation_of_3-D_ultrasound_prostate_images_using_statistical_texture_matching_method","7232857_Yushkevich_PA_Piven_J_Hazlett_HC_Smith_RG_Ho_S_Gee_JC_Gerig_GUser-guided_3D_active_contour_segmentation_of_anatomical_structures_significantly_improved_efficiency_and_reliability_Neuroimage_311116-112","7122397_Segmentation_of_Prostate_Boundaries_From_Ultrasound_Images_Using_Statistical_Shape_Model"]}
