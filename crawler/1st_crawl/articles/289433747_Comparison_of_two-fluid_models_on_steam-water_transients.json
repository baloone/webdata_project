{"id":"289433747_Comparison_of_two-fluid_models_on_steam-water_transients","abstract":"This paper is devoted to the comparison of three two-fluid models in steam-water applications involving phase transition and shock waves. The three models are presented in a common formalism that helps to underline their shared properties. A numerical method based on previous work is extended to all models and to more complex Equations Of State. Particular attention is paid to the verification of every step of the method so that convergence studies can be carried out. Afterwards, models are compared with each other and with experimental data in two different cases of steam-water transients. The first one is Simpson water-hammer experiment and the second one is a rapid depressurization with flashing studied in Canon experiment.","authors":["Hippolyte Lochon","Frédéric Daude","Pascal Galon","Jean-Marc Hérard"],"meta":["November 2016ESAIM Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis 50(6):1631 - 1657","DOI:10.1051/m2an/2016001","Projects: Development in the fast transient dynamics code Europlexus.Multiphase flow models and associated numerical schemes"],"references":["282599936_Closure_Conditions_for_Non-Equilibrium_Multi-Component_Models","278670449_Dynamic_relaxation_processes_in_compressible_multiphase_flows_Application_to_evaporation_phenomena","278273666_Approximate_solutions_of_the_Baer-Nunziato_model","270894531_Large_Water-Hammer_Pressures_for_Column_Separation_in_Pipelines","267896669_Validation_of_a_two-fluid_model_on_unsteady_liquid-vapor_water_flows","263539151_RELAP-7_Demonstrating_Seven-Equation_Two-Phase_Flow_Simulation_in_a_Single-_Pipe_Two-Phase_Reactor_Core_and_Steam_SeparatorDryer","278090064_HLLC-Type_Riemann_Solver_for_the_Baer-Nunziato_Equations_of_Compressible_Two-Phase_Flow","270725707_A_three_phase_flow_model","264901254_Une_classe_de_modeles_diphasiques_bifluides_avec_changement_de_regime","264901088_Une_approche_bifluide_statistique_de_modelisation_des_ecoulements_diphasiques_a_phases_compressibles"]}
