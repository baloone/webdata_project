{"id":"228945005_Exploring_regular_reversibility_in_Watson-Crick_finite_automata","abstract":"Watson-Crick finite automata were inspired by formal language theory, finite states machines and some ingredients from DNA computing such as working with molecules as double stranded complementary strings. Here, we define different kinds of regular reversibility in this model. Mainly, we will explore regular reversibility in the upper (lower) strand and in the double strand.","authors":["Jos√© M.
