{"id":"269997990_Triple_Massey_products_and_absolute_Galois_groups","abstract":"Let $p$ be a prime number, $F$ a field containing a root of unity of order\n$p$, and $G_F$ the absolute Galois group. Extending results of Hopkins,\nWickelgren, Minac and Tan, we prove that the triple Massey product\n$H^1(G_F)^3\\to H^2(G_F)$ contains $0$ whenever it is nonempty. This gives a new\nrestriction on the possible profinite group structure of $G_F$.","authors":["Ido Efrat","Eliyahu Matzri"],"meta":["December 2014Journal of the European Mathematical Society 19(12)","DOI:10.4171/JEMS/748","SourcearXiv","Project: Massey products in Galois cohomology"],"references":["266396637_Vanishing_of_Massey_Products_and_Brauer_Groups","260909552_Triple_Massey_products_over_global_fields","251876269_Triple_Massey_products_and_Galois_theory","285908961_n-Nilpotent_obstructions_to_p1-sections_of_P1set_minus0_1_and_Massey_products_In_Conference_on_Galois-Teichmuller_Theory_and_Arithmetic_Geometry","267665044_Cohomology_of_Number_Fields","265807334_Techniques_of_geometric_topology","259220317_The_kernel_unipotent_conjecture_and_the_vanishing_of_Massey_products_for_odd_rigid_fields","243111856_On_the_Galois_group_of_2-extensions_with_restricted_ramification","243086700_Milnor_invariants_and_Massey_products_for_prime_numbers","243076158_Massey_Higher_Products","243018335_Division_algebras_of_exponent_2_and_characteristic_2","234059929_The_Zassenhaus_filtration_Massey_Products_and_Representations_ofProfinite_Groups","233866220_Higher_Massey_products_in_the_cohomology_of_mild_pro-p-groups","232276091_Splitting_Varieties_for_Triple_Massey_Products","228590752_Algebraic_invariants_of_links"]}
