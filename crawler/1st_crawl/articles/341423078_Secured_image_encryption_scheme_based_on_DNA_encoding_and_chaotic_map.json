{"id":"341423078_Secured_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_DNA_encoding_and_chaotic_map","abstract":"Recent research has considered DNA as a medium for ultra-scale computation and ultra-compact information storage. In recent years, the chaos based cryptographic algorithms have suggested some new and efficient ways to develop secure image encryption techniques. In this communication, we propose a new approach for image encryption based on hybrid model of chaotic logistic maps, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) masking and DNA replacement algorithm in order to meet the requirements of the secure image transfer. The significant advantage of this approach is improving the quality of DNA masks to obtain the best mask that is compatible with plain images. The experimental results and entropy analysis both confirm that the proposed scheme not only demonstrates excellent encryption but also resists various typical attacks.","authors":["Soumya Paul","Pranjal Dasgupta","Prabir Kr.
