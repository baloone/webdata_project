{"id":"273127270_A_Transformation_of_Accelerated_Double_Step_Size_Method_for_Unconstrained_Optimization","abstract":"A reduction of the originally double step size iteration into the single step length scheme is derived under the proposed condition\nthat relates two step lengths in the accelerated double step size gradient descent scheme.The proposed transformation is numerically\ntested. Obtained results confirm the substantial progress in comparison with the single step size accelerated gradient descent\nmethod defined in a classical way regarding all analyzed characteristics: number of iterations, CPU time, and number of function\nevaluations. Linear convergence of derived method has been proved.","authors":["Predrag Stanimirovic","Gradimir V. Milovanovic","Milena J.
