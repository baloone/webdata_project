{"id":"262986470_The_Complexity_of_Ergodic_Mean-payoff_Games","abstract":"We study two-player (zero-sum) concurrent mean-payoff games played on a finite-state graph. We focus on the important sub-class of ergodic games where all states are visited infinitely often with probability 1. The algorithmic study of ergodic games was initiated in a seminal work of Hoffman and Karp in 1966, but all basic complexity questions have remained unresolved. Our main results for ergodic games are as follows: We establish (1) an optimal exponential bound on the patience of stationary strategies (where patience of a distribution is the inverse of the smallest positive probability and represents a complexity measure of a stationary strategy); (2) the approximation problem lie in FNP; (3) the approximation problem is at least as hard as the decision problem for simple stochastic games (for which NP intersection coNP is the long-standing best known bound). We present a variant of the strategy-iteration algorithm by Hoffman and Karp; show that both our algorithm and the classical value-iteration algorithm can approximate the value in exponential time; and identify a subclass where the value-iteration algorithm is a FPTAS. We also show that the exact value can be expressed in the existential theory of the reals, and establish square-root sum hardness for a related class of games.","authors":["Krishnendu Chatterjee","Rasmus Ibsen-Jensen"],"meta":["March 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-43951-7_11","Conference: International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming"],"references":["221590597_Some_algebraic_and_geometric_computations_in_PSPACE","220617437_On_the_Complexity_of_Nash_Equilibria_and_Other_Fixed_Points","4355054_Automatic_verification_of_probabilistic_concurrent_finite_state_programs","315162179_Recursive_Concurrent_Stochastic_Games","313559347_Stochastic_Games_with_Zero_Stop_Probabilities","290113970_Chapter_8_Markov_decision_processes","286292797_A_Potential_Reduction_Algorithm_for_Ergodic_Two-Person_Zero-Sum_Limiting_Average_Payoff_Stochastic_Games","266066629_Competitive_Markov_Decision_Processes","261836371_The_Complexity_of_Ergodic_Mean-payoff_Games","244506915_The_Asymptotic_Theory_of_Stochastic_Games","242327888_Finite_markov_decision_processes","230887855_Markov_Decision_Processes_Discrete_Stochastic_Dynamic_Programming","227442979_On_Nonterminating_Stochastic_Games","227025584_Stochastic_games","226438140_Random_walks_on_finite_groups_and_rapidly_mixing_Markov_chains","225531486_Stochastic_limit-average_games_are_in_EXPTIME","222785304_The_complexity_of_mean_payoff_games_on_graphs","222678929_Quantitative_Solution_of_Omega-Regular_Games","222444446_The_complexity_of_stochastic_games","221591213_Exact_algorithms_for_solving_stochastic_games","38365114_The_big_match","7191525_Stochastic_Games"]}
