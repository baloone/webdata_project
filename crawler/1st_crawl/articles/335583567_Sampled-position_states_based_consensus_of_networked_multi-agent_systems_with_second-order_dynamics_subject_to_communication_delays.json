{"id":"335583567_Sampled-position_states_based_consensus_of_networked_multi-agent_systems_with_second-order_dynamics_subject_to_communication_delays","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the sampled-position states based consensus of networked multi-agent systems with second-order dynamics, where agents are connected through communication channels subject to time-varying communication delays. Note that consensus in such systems cannot be reached if using only the current sampled-position states. This paper investigates the positive effects of time-varying communication delays on the consensus. For two cases, where a directed graph has a fixed or switching topology, several sufficient conditions on consensus are derived by using a discretized Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method. Based on the obtained conditions, suitable control protocols can be devised through tuning two parameters. Finally, simulation shows that consensus can be achieved using sampled-position states if the time-varying communication delays are within a certain time interval with its lower bound strictly greater than zero.","authors":["Yanping Yang","Xian-Ming Zhang","Wangli He","Qing-Long Han"],"meta":["September 2019Information Sciences 509","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2019.08.073"],"references":["328404406_An_overview_of_recent_advances_in_stability_of_linear_systems_with_time-varying_delays","320895126_An_Overview_of_Recent_Advances_in_Event-Triggered_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems","270764231_Network-based_output_tracking_control_for_T-S_fuzzy_systems_using_an_event-triggered_communication_scheme","265648771_Network-Based_Output_Tracking_Control_for_a_Class_of_T-S_Fuzzy_Systems_That_Can_Not_Be_Stabilized_by_Nondelayed_Output_Feedback_Controllers","331735263_A_Survey_on_Model-Based_Distributed_Control_and_Filtering_for_Industrial_Cyber-Physical_Systems","329052797_Mobile_Robot_Networks_for_Environmental_Monitoring_A_Cooperative_Receding_Horizon_Temporal_Logic_Control_Approach","327757193_Distributed_event-triggered_consensus_for_nonlinear_multi-agent_systems_subject_to_cyber_attacks","326962623_H_Synchronization_of_Networked_Master-Slave_Oscillators_With_Delayed_Position_Data_The_Positive_Effects_of_Network-Induced_Delays","326137207_Prescribed_Finite-Time_Consensus_Tracking_for_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Nonholonomic_Chained-Form_Dynamics","324961552_Network-Based_T-S_Fuzzy_Dynamic_Positioning_Controller_Design_for_Unmanned_Marine_Vehicles","324367236_Rolling_optimization_formation_control_for_multi-agent_systems_under_unknown_prior_desired_shapes","324071284_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems_With_Nonlinear_Dynamics_Using_an_Integrated_Sampled-Data-Based_Event-Triggered_Communication_Scheme","323949537_An_Overview_of_Recent_Advances_in_Fixed-Time_Cooperative_Control_of_Multiagent_Systems","323716543_Event-Triggered_Consensus_for_Linear_Continuous-time_Multi-agent_Systems_Based_on_a_Predictor","321664157_Hierarchical_Type_Stability_Criteria_for_Delayed_Neural_Networks_via_Canonical_Bessel-Legendre_Inequalities","319926914_Fault-Tolerant_Coordination_Control_for_Second-Order_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Partial_Actuator_Effectiveness","319699609_Achieving_Cluster_Formation_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_Under_Aperiodic_Sampling_and_Communication_Delays","313691249_Consensus_seeking_in_multi-agent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies","309305479_Sampled-Data_Control_of_Switched_Linear_Systems_With_Application_to_an_F-18_Aircraft","301719608_Observer_Design_for_Tracking_Consensus_in_Second-Order_Multi-Agent_Systems_Fractional_Order_Less_Than_Two","297769144_Consensus_Algorithms_for_Double-integrator_Dynamics","297676312_A_PD-Like_Protocol_With_a_Time_Delay_to_Average_Consensus_Control_for_Multi-Agent_Systems_Under_an_Arbitrarily_Fast_Switching_Topology","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","285435889_Network-based_leader-following_consensus_of_nonlinear_multi-agent_systems_via_distributed_impulsive_control","284122950_Event-triggered_consensus_control_for_discrete-time_stochastic_multi-agent_systems_The_input-to-state_stability_in_probability","284122790_Some_necessary_and_sufficient_conditions_for_consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_sampled_position_data","277027250_Hierarchy_of_LMI_conditions_for_the_stability_analysis_of_time-delay_systems","267928786_Sampled-data_leader-following_consensus_for_nonlinear_multi-agent_systems_with_Markovian_switching_topologies_and_communication_delay","262424479_Wirtinger-based_integral_inequality_Application_to_time-delay_systems","260542223_Stationary_Consensus_of_Asynchronous_Discrete-Time_Second-Order_Multi-Agent_Systems_Under_Switching_Topology","254320514_Accelerating_average_consensus_by_using_the_information_of_second-order_neighbours_with_communication_delays","241045043_Stability_of_Time-Delay_Systems","229672585_A_Generalized_Discretization_Scheme_of_Lyapunov_Functional_in_the_Stability_Problem_of_Linear_Uncertain_Time-Delay_Systems","229091513_Recent_Research_in_Cooperative_Control_of_Multi-Vehicle_Systems","227753103_Consensus_of_multi-agent_systems_with_nonlinear_dynamics_and_sampled-data_information_A_delayed-input_approach","223009305_Distributed_Observers_Design_for_Leader-following_Control_of_Multi-Agent_Networks","222872078_Tracking_Control_for_Multi-Agent_consensus_with_an_Active_Leader_and_Variable_Topology","222826458_Average_consensus_in_networks_of_dynamic_agents_with_switching_topologies_and_multiple_time-varying_delays","220519441_Second-order_consensus_for_multi-agent_systems_with_switching_topology_and_communication_delay","220157743_Second-order_consensus_in_multi-agent_dynamical_systems_with_sampled_position_data"]}
