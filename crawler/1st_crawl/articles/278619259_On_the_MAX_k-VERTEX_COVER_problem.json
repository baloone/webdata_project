{"id":"278619259_On_the_MAX_k-VERTEX_COVER_problem","abstract":"Given a graph G(V,E) of order n and a constant k ≤ n, the MAX k-VERTEX COVER problem consists of determining k vertices that cover the maximum number of edges in G. In its (standard) parameterized version, MAX k-VERTEX COVER can be stated as follows: \"given G, k and parameter ℓ, does G contain k vertices that cover at least ℓ edges?\". We first devise moderately exponential exact algorithms for MAX k-VERTEX COVER, with complexity exponential to n (note that the known results concerned time bounds of the form $n^(O(k))$) by developing a branch and reduce method based upon the measure-and-conquer technique. We then prove that, interestingly enough, although MAX k-VERTEX COVER is non fixed parameter tractable with respect to ℓ, it is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the size τ of a minimum vertex cover of G. We also point out that the same happens for a lot of well-known problems quite different from MAX k-VERTEX COVER. We finally study approximation MAX k-VERTEX COVER by moderately exponential algorithms. The general goal of the issue of moderately exponential approximation is to catch-up on polynomial inapproximability, by providing algorithms achieving, with worst-case running times importantly smaller than those needed for exact computation, approximation ratios unachievable in polynomial time.","authors":["Federico Della Croce","Vangelis Paschos"],"meta":["March 2011"],"references":["225449378_Fixed-Parameter_Approximation_Conceptual_Framework_and_Approximability_Results","220530560_Some_New_Techniques_in_Design_and_Analysis_of_Exact_Exponential_Algorithms","220430761_A_Measure_Conquer_Approach_for_the_Analysis_of_Exact_Algorithms","268247843_On_the_complexity_of_the_subgraph_problem","251362708_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Graph_Partitioning_Problems_Extended_Abstract","226258132_On_Colouring_the_Nodes_of_a_Network","223445877_On_Efficient_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms_for_Weighted_Vertex_Cover","222686213_Exponential-time_approximation_of_weighted_set_cover","222673286_Vertex_Cover_Further_Observations_and_Further_Improvements","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222551950_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximization_Problems_Arising_in_Graph_Partitioning","222509268_Clustering_and_domination_in_perfect_graphs","222072921_Efficient_approximation_of_min_set_cover_by_moderately_exponential_algorithms","220992949_Parameterized_Approximation_Problems","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220617850_Set_Partitioning_via_Inclusion-Exclusion","220149047_Exact_and_approximate_bandwidth","220112015_Parameterized_approximation_of_dominating_set_problems","48445026_Efficient_Approximation_of_Combinatorial_Problems_by_Moderately_Exponential_Algorithms","45856085_An_Exponential_Time_2-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Bandwidth","41221933_Efficient_approximation_of_MIN_COLORING_by_moderately_exponential_algorithms","30987754_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Cardinality_Constrained_Optimization_Problems","29642899_Effcient_approximation_by_low-complexity_exponential_algorithms","2560621_On_Efficient_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms_for_Weighted_Vertex_Cover"]}
