{"id":"332415379_Internet_of_Things_IoT_Operating_Systems_Management_Opportunities_Challenges_and_Solution","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing and contributing drastically to improve the quality of life. Immense technological innovations and growth is a key factor in IoT advancements. Readily available low cost IoT hardware is essential for continuous adaptation of IoT. Advancements in IoT Operating System (OS) to support these newly developed IoT hardware along with the recent standards and techniques for all the communication layers are the way forward. The variety of IoT OS availability demands to support interoperability that requires to follow standard set of rules for development and protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous deployment scenarios. IoT requires to be intelligent to self-adapt according to the network conditions. In this paper, we present brief overview of different IoT OSs, supported hardware, and future research directions. Therein, we provide overview of the accepted papers in our Special Issue on IoT OS management: opportunities, challenges, and solution. Finally, we conclude the manuscript.","authors":["Yousaf Bin Zikria","Sung Won Kim","Oliver Hahm","Muhammad Khalil Afzal"],"meta":["April 2019Sensors 8(19):1-10","DOI:10.3390/s19081793"],"references":["332996159_A_Novel_Internet_of_Things-Enabled_Accident_Detection_and_Reporting_System_for_Smart_City_Environments","332564432_Spatial-Temporal_Sensing_and_Utilization_in_Full_Duplex_Spectrum-Heterogeneous_Cognitive_Radio_Networks_for_the_Internet_of_Things","331683715_A_Secured_Proxy-Based_Data_Sharing_Module_in_IoT_Environments_Using_Blockchain","331652334_Transparent_CoAP_Services_to_IoT_Endpoints_through_ICN_Operator_Networks","331171335_Process_Management_in_IoT_Operating_Systems_Cross-Influence_between_Processing_and_Communication_Tasks_in_End-Devices","330797115_YetiOS_an_Adaptive_Operating_System_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","328956857_Information-Centric_Network-Based_Vehicular_Communications_Overview_and_Research_Opportunities","328487522_Multiple_Access_Control_for_Cognitive_Radio-Based_IEEE_80211ah_Networks","327949196_Void_Hole_Avoidance_for_Reliable_Data_Delivery_in_IoT_Enabled_Underwater_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","328325550_Unlocking_5G_Spectrum_Potential_for_Intelligent_IoT_Opportunities_Challenges_and_Solutions"]}
