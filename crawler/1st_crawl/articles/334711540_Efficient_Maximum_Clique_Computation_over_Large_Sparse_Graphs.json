{"id":"334711540_Efficient_Maximum_Clique_Computation_over_Large_Sparse_Graphs","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of MCC-Sparse, Maximum Clique Computation over large real-world graphs that are usually Sparse. In the literature, MCC-Sparse has been studied separately and less extensively than its dense counterpart MCC-Dense, and advanced algorithmic techniques that are developed for MCC-Dense have not been utilized in the existing MCC-Sparse solvers. In this paper, we design an algorithm MC-BRB which transforms an instance of MCC-Sparse to instances of k-clique finding over dense subgraphs (KCF-Dense) that can be computed by the existing MCC-Dense solvers. To further improve the efficiency, we then develop a new branch-reduce-&-bound framework for KCF-Dense by proposing light-weight reducing techniques and leveraging the existing advanced branching and bounding techniques of MCC-Dense solvers. In addition, we also design an ego-centric algorithm MC-EGO for heuristically computing a near-maximum clique in near-linear time. We conduct extensive empirical studies on large real graphs and demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our techniques.","authors":["Lijun Chang"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3292500.3330986","Conference: the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference"],"references":["317756946_Finding_near-optimal_independent_sets_at_scale","316849563_Computing_A_Near-Maximum_Independent_Set_in_Linear_Time_by_Reducing-Peeling","313851224_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Finding_Maximum_and_Maximal_Cliques_and_Their_Applications","268988477_New_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem_on_Large_Sparse_Graphs_with_Applications_to_Overlapping_Community_Detection","228771835_Emergent_clique_formation_in_terrorist_recruitment","227238953_The_Maximum_Clique_Problem","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","344745255_Cohesive_Subgraph_Computation_Over_Large_Sparse_Graphs","320074168_QFrag_distributed_graph_search_via_subgraph_isomorphism","319597741_Finding_the_maximum_clique_in_massive_graphs","314033019_On_Minimization_of_the_Number_of_Branches_in_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","304021440_DUALSIM_Parallel_Subgraph_Enumeration_in_a_Massive_Graph_on_a_Single_Machine","283850509_Parallel_Maximum_Clique_Algorithms_with_Applications_to_Network_Analysis","280979699_A_new_exact_maximum_clique_algorithm_for_large_and_massive_sparse_graphs","262212709_Combining_MaxSAT_Reasoning_and_Incremental_Upper_Bound_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","261087786_Scalable_maximum_clique_computation_using_MapReduce","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","222712643_Complex_networks_Structure_and_dynamics","222444611_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","222436546_The_Worst-Case_Time_Complexity_for_Generating_All_Maximal_Cliques_and_Computational_Experiments","221574099_Unsupervised_Anomaly_Detection_in_Network_Intrusion_Detection_Using_Clusters","221013447_A_Simple_and_Faster_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Clique","220617027_Arboricity_and_Subgraph_Listing_Algorithms","47660740_Large_cliques_in_Arabidopsis_gene_coexpression_network_and_motif_discovery"]}
