{"id":"317373263_A_high-resolution_head-related_transfer_function_and_three-dimensional_ear_model_database","abstract":"Nowadays immersive three-dimensional virtual scenes have become very popular. This paper presents and provides a database of 48 head-related transfer function (HRTF) datasets and the corresponding three-dimensional ear mesh models of individual subjects, in order to select or model an HRTF dataset for binaural synthesis and auditory reproduction. For easy access, the database of the Institute of Technical Acoustics (RWTH Aachen University, Germany) is accessible online. The HRTF measurement setup and the generation of the three-dimensionalmodels of the ear geometry, reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging scans, are specifically described in depth.","authors":["Ramona Bomhardt","Mat√≠as de la Fuente","Janina Fels"],"meta":["November 2016Proceedings of meetings on acoustics Acoustical Society of America 29(1):050002","DOI:10.1121/2.0000467","Conference: 172nd Meeting of the Acoustical Society of AmericaAt: Honolulu, Hawaii","Project: Individualization of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs)"],"references":["264707872_Dataset_of_head-related_transfer_functions_measured_with_a_circular_loudspeaker_array","236024151_On_the_Optimization_of_the_Multiple_Exponential_Sweep_Method","233582273_Calculation_of_Head-Related_Transfer_Functions_for_Arbitrary_Field_Points_Using_Spherical_Harmonics_Decomposition","228989052_Multiple_exponential_sweep_method_for_fast_measurement_of_head-related_transfer_functions","200045092_Spatial_hearing_the_psychophysics_of_human_sound_localization","14844055_Localization_using_nonindividualized_head-related_transfer_functions","311444702_Analytical_Ellipsoidal_Model_of_Interaural_Time_Differences_for_the_Individualization_of_Head-Related_Impulse_Responses","279713719_Head-related_transfer_functions_of_human_subjects","265413992_scshape_listen_hrtf_database","263712073_Personalization_of_head-related_transfer_functions_in_the_median_plane_based_on_the_anthropometry_of_the_listener's_pinnae","226626359_Anthropometric_Parameters_Influencing_Head-Related_Transfer_Functions","223467496_On_the_Relation_Between_Pinna_Reflection_Patterns_and_Head-Related_Transfer_Function_Features","21591929_The_dominant_role_of_low-frequency_interaural_time_differences_in_sound_localisation","17525870_Sound_Pressure_Generated_in_an_External-Ear_Replica_and_Real_Human_Ears_by_a_Nearby_Point_Source","3927289_The_CIPIC_HRTF_database","3334042_Analysis_and_design_of_spherical_microphone_arrays","3333560_Fast_deconvolution_of_multichannel_systems_using_regularization"]}
