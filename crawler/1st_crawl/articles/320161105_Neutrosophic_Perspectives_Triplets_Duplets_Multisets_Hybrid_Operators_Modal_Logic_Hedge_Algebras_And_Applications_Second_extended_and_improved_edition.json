Its aim is to present the last developments in the field. \nThis is the second extended and improved edition of Neutrosophic Perspectives (September 2017; first edition was published in June 2017).\nFor the first time, we now introduce:\n— Neutrosophic Duplets and the Neutrosophic Duplet Structures;\n— Neutrosophic Multisets (as an extension of the classical multisets);\n— Neutrosophic Spherical Numbers; \n— Neutrosophic Overnumbers / Undernumbers / Offnumbers; \n— Neutrosophic Indeterminacy of Second Type;\n— Neutrosophic Hybrid Operators (where the heterogeneous t-norms and t-conorms may be used in designing neutrosophic aggregations);\n— Neutrosophic Triplet Loop;\n— Neutrosophic Triplet Function;\n— Neutrosophic Modal Logic;\n— and Neutrosophic Hedge Algebras.\nThe Refined Neutrosophic Set / Logic / Probability were introduced in 2013 by F. Smarandache. Since year 2016 a new interest has been manifested by researchers for the Neutrosophic Triplets and their corresponding Neutros-ophic Triplet Algebraic Structures (introduced by F. Smarandache & M. Ali). Subtraction and Division of Neutrosophic Numbers were introduced by F. Smarandache - 2016, and Jun Ye – 2017.\nWe also present various new applications in: neutrosophic multi-criteria decision-making, neutrosophic psychology, neutrosophic geographical function (the equatorial virtual line), neutrosophic probability in target identification, neutrosophic dynamic systems, neutrosophic quantum computers, neutrosophic theory of evolution, and neutrosophic triplet structures in our everyday life.","authors":["Florentin Smarandache"],"meta":["October 2017","Project: New Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications"],"references":["308949482_Symbolic_Neutrosophic_Theory","304586431_Neutrosophic_Overset_Neutrosophic_Underset_and_Neutrosophic_Offset_Similarly_for_Neutrosophic_Over-Under-Off-_Logic_Probability_and_Statistics","282853586_Symbolic_Neutrosophic_Theory","281026425_A_survey_of_Cyber_Attack_Detection_Strategies","325693104_An_improved_score_function_for_ranking_neutrosophic_sets_and_its_application_to_decision-making_process","324359391_The_Lysenko_Affair","309457075_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","306105699_Introduction_to_neutrosophic_logic","275988758_Ancestors_The_Hard_Evidence","274491510_Unfinished_Synthesis","273994139_Dynamic_Model_on_the_Transmission_of_Malicious_Codes_in_Network","271367306_A_predator-prey-disease_model_with_immune_response_in_infected_prey","270087293_Evolution_The_History_of_an_Idea","269823508_The_Darwinian_Heritage","269151476_Foundations_of_many-valued_reasoning"]}
