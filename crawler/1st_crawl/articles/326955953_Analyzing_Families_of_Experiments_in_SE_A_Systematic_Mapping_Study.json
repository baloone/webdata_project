{"id":"326955953_Analyzing_Families_of_Experiments_in_SE_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","abstract":"Context: Families of experiments (i.e., groups of experiments with the same goal) are on the rise in Software Engineering (SE). Selecting unsuitable aggregation techniques to analyze families may undermine their potential to provide in-depth insights from experiments' results.","authors":["Adrian Santos","Omar S.
