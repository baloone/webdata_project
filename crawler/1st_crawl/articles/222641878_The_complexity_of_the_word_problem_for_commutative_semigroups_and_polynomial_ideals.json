{"id":"222641878_The_complexity_of_the_word_problem_for_commutative_semigroups_and_polynomial_ideals","abstract":"Any decision procedure for the word problems for commutative semigroups and polynomial deals inherently requires computational storage space growing exponentially with the size of the problem instance to which the procedure is applied. This bound is achieved by a simple procedure for the semigroup problem.","authors":["Ernst W. Mayr","Albert R.
