{"id":"267631509_L'espace_dans_la_modelisation_des_interactions_nature-societe","abstract":"The paper examines how space is usually included into models dedicated to simulate interactions between\nanthroposystems and environment. The role of space in modelling depends on the aim of the model. Today, most of the simulation models are focused on understanding the behaviour of complex socio-economic and\nbiophysical systems, with multiple interlinked components. These models are intended for specialists and quite difficult to use. At the same time, spatial models are needed to provide municipalities with a tool that they canuse easily to manage their territory and to assist decision-makers in local planning. These models are relevant to geoprospective purposes. An example of spatio-morphological modelling used to predict urban sprawl is presented.\nKEY WORDS : Space, system, image analysis, decision-maker, geoprospective purposes.","authors":["Christine Voiron-Canicio"],"meta":["May 2006","DOI:10.13140/2.1.2944.0963","Conference: Colloque Interactions Nature-Société, analyse et modèles.At: La Baule"],"references":["228462409_Espace_geographique_spatialisation_et_modelisation_en_dynamique_des_systemes","228362907_An_Open_Geographic_Modeling_Environment","37618591_Modelling_Decision-Making_in_Rural_Communities_at_the_Forest_Margin","332604477_Analyse_d'images_et_analyse_spatiale","292604498_Modelisation_spatio-temporelle_d'activites_humaines_a_fort_impact_environnemental_Application_a_l'etude_des_pratiques_agricoles_intensives_dans_le_departement_du_Finistere","265800222_MODELISATION_DYNAMIQUE_ET_SYSTEME_D'INFORMATION_GEOGRAPHIQUE","44433678_Analyse_spatiale_et_analyse_d'_images_par_la_morphologie_mathematique_Christine_Voiron-Canicio"]}
