Descriptive statistics, T -tests, one-way ANOVA and multiple regression analyses were used to analyze the data.\n\nFindings\nThe mean score of students' satisfaction was low ( m = 45.14, SD = 25.62). Regarding student's interaction, learner-instructor interaction had the highest total mean score ( m = 58.53, SD = 24.51), followed by learner-learner interaction ( m = 47.50, SD = 22.64). Learner-content interaction had the lowest total mean score ( m = 45.80, SD = 24.60). Significant differences in students' satisfaction were identified according to the level of education, university type and marital status. Significant predictors of students' satisfaction with online education were self-regulated learning, Internet self-efficacy, learner-content interaction, learner-learner interaction and the number of e-learning theoretical courses.\n\nOriginality/value\nOnline education is not well-established in developing countries. This study contributed to the limited knowledge of university studentsâ€™ preparedness and satisfaction with online education during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.","authors":["Khaldoun Hamdan","Ahmad M Al-Bashaireh","Zainab Zahran","Amal Al-Daghestani"],"meta":["January 2021International Journal of Educational Management ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print)","DOI:10.1108/IJEM-11-2020-0513"],"references":["340923805_Coronavirus_COVID-19_A_Review_of_Clinical_Features_Diagnosis_and_Treatment","340438391_Closure_of_Universities_Due_to_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_Impact_on_Education_and_Mental_Health_of_Students_and_Academic_Staff","340316597_Coronavirus_Disease_COVID-19_and_Pediatric_Patients_A_Review_of_Epidemiology_Symptomatology_Laboratory_and_Imaging_Results_to_Guide_the_Development_of_a_Management_Algorithm","337562144_Online_vs_Classroom_learning_Examining_motivational_and_SRL_strategies_among_VET_students","331558333_Participation_in_Online_Courses_and_Interaction_With_a_Virtual_Agent","331021518_Does_e-learning_service_quality_influence_e-learning_student_satisfaction_and_loyalty_Evidence_from_Vietnam","329379022_Students'_perceptions_toward_online_learning_and_face-to-face_learning_courses","328819554_An_Analysis_on_Adult_Learners'_Satisfaction_in_Online_Education_Programmes","321184426_Applying_Best_Practice_Online_Learning_Teaching_and_Support_to_Intensive_Online_Environments_An_Integrative_Review","317154551_Guidelines_for_developing_translating_and_validating_a_questionnaire_in_perioperative_and_pain_medicine","314196348_Should_Gender_Differences_be_Considered_When_Assessing_Student_Satisfaction_in_the_Online_Learning_Environment_for_Millennials","309567185_On-campus_or_online_examining_self-regulation_and_cognitive_transfer_skills_in_different_learning_settings","302890628_Grades_Student_Satisfaction_and_Retention_in_Online_and_Face-to-Face_Introductory_Psychology_Units_A_Test_of_Equivalency_Theory","296704124_Self-Efficacy_In_Online_Learning_Environments_A_Literature_Review","289151844_The_importance_of_interaction_in_web-based_education_A_program-level_case_study_of_online_MBA_courses","286315126_Is_the_Online_Generation_Ready_for_Online_Learning_A_Study_of_Online_Technologies_Self-Efficacy_Perceptions_as_Predictors_of_Academic_Success_in_Virtual_Education_Programs","279320409_Online_Instruction_E-Learning_and_Student_Satisfaction_A_Three_Year_Study","252541449_Class_size_and_interaction_in_online_courses","249798035_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Three_Types_of_Interaction_Treatments_in_Distance_Education","220316483_Interaction_in_Distance_Education_and_Online_Learning_Using_Evidence_and_Theory_to_Improve_Practice","322409323_Student-to-Student_Interaction_in_Distance_Education_Classes_What_Do_Graduate_Students_Want","313420462_Self-regulated_learning_and_performance_An_introduction_and_an_overview","313284284_Social_Presence_in_Relation_to_Students'_Satisfaction_and_Learning_in_the_Online_Environment_A_Meta-analysis","303163025_Effects_of_Online_Interaction_on_Adult_Students'_Satisfaction_and_Learning","285831994_Self-Efficacy_The_Exercise_of_Control","284041463_Key_factors_for_determining_student_satisfaction_in_online_courses","277349850_Factors_Affecting_Perceived_Learning_Satisfaction_and_Quality_in_the_Online_MBA_A_Structural_Equation_Modeling_Approach","277055469_Student_Satisfaction_of_Online_Courses_for_Educational_Leadership","276833107_Factors_Influencing_Student_Satisfaction_and_Perceived_Learning_in_Online_Courses","267696133_K-12_teachers'_perceptions_of_and_their_satisfaction_with_interaction_type_in_blended_learning_environments","265303586_SELF-REGULATION_AND_ONLINE_COURSE_SATISFACTION_IN_HIGH_SCHOOL","262830134_Students'_characteristics_self-regulated_learning_technology_self-efficacy_and_course_outcomes_in_online_learning","262576714_Effects_of_online_college_student's_Internet_self-efficacy_on_learning_motivation_and_performance","259143526_Instructor_scaffolding_for_interaction_and_students'_academic_engagement_in_online_learning_Mediating_role_of_perceived_online_class_goal_structures","258099307_Interaction_Internet_self-efficacy_and_self-_regulated_learning_as_predictors_of_student_satisfaction_in_online_education_courses","257496488_Students'_self-regulation_for_interaction_with_others_in_online_learning_environments","251690339_Evaluation_of_E-learning_program_versus_traditional_lecture_instruction_for_undergraduate_nursing_students_in_a_faculty_of_nursing","237455406_A_Comparison_Of_Student_Outcomes_And_Student_Satisfaction_In_Three_MBA_Human_Resource_Management_Classes_Based_On_Traditional_Vs_Online_Learning","227048853_Assessing_Response_Rates_and_Nonresponse_Bias_in_Web_and_Paper_Surveys","46051655_Interaction_Internet_Self-Efficacy_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_as_Predictors_of_Student_Satisfaction_in_Distance_Education_Courses"]}
