{"id":"285270660_Spatially_Distributed_Sampling_and_Reconstruction","abstract":"A spatially distributed system contains a large amount of agents with limited\nsensing, data processing, and communication capabilities. Recent technological\nadvances have opened up possibilities to deploy spatially distributed systems\nfor signal sampling and reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce a graph\nstructure for a distributed sampling and reconstruction system by coupling\nagents in a spatially distributed system with innovative positions of signals.\nA fundamental problem in sampling theory is the robustness of signal\nreconstruction in the presence of sampling noises. For a distributed sampling\nand reconstruction system, the robustness could be reduced to the stability of\nits sensing matrix. In a traditional centralized sampling and reconstruction\nsystem, the stability of the sensing matrix could be verified by its central\nprocessor, but the above procedure is infeasible in a distributed sampling and\nreconstruction system as it is decentralized. In this paper, we split a\ndistributed sampling and reconstruction system into a family of overlapping\nsmaller subsystems, and we show that the stability of the sensing matrix holds\nif and only if its quasi-restrictions to those subsystems have uniform\nstability. This new stability criterion could be pivotal for the design of a\nrobust distributed sampling and reconstruction system against supplement,\nreplacement and impairment of agents, as we only need to check the uniform\nstability of affected subsystems. In this paper, we also propose an\nexponentially convergent distributed algorithm for signal reconstruction, that\nprovides a suboptimal approximation to the original signal in the presence of\nbounded sampling noises.","authors":["Cheng Cheng","Yingchun Jiang","Qiyu Sun"],"meta":["November 2015Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis 47(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.acha.2017.07.007","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265069795_Wiener's_lemma_Pictures_at_an_exhibition","260686706_Collective_Motion_Sensor_Networks_and_Ocean_Sampling","259633349_Rate_of_Innovation_for_Non-Periodic_Signals_and_Optimal_Lower_Stability_Bound_for_Filtering","245577822_Autonomous_Oceanographic_Sampling_Network","238282902_Non-uniform_sampling_and_reconstruction_in_shift-invariant_spaces","237324432_Shannon_sampling_and_function_reconstruction_from_point_values","235892382_Distributed_Optimization_Over_Time-Varying_Directed_Graphs","232743809_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_of_Spatial_Fields_Using_Mobile_Sensors","232272943_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs","228649353_Exact_iterative_reconstruction_algorithm_for_multivariate_irregularly_sampled_functions_in_spline-like_spaces_The_L_p-theory","228346405_The_Noncommutative_Wiener_Lemma_Linear_Independence_and_Spectral_Properties_of_the_Algebra_of_Time-Frequency_Shift_Operators","226636560_Beurling_Dimension_of_Gabor_Pseudoframes_for_Affine_Subspaces","226378872_Convolution_Average_Sampling_and_a_Calderon_Resolution_of_the_Identity_for_Shift-Invariant_Spaces","225915336_Beurling-Landau-Type_theorems_for_non-uniform_sampling_in_shift_invariant_spline_spaces","225693010_Efficient_numerical_methods_in_non-uniform_sampling_theory","225402272_Reconstructing_Signals_with_Finite_Rate_of_Innovation_from_Noisy_Samples","224327960_Nonlinear_and_Nonideal_Sampling_Theory_and_Methods","222534027_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","220656591_Fast_Local_Reconstruction_Methods_for_Nonuniform_Sampling_in_Shift_Invariant_Spaces","344552624_Symmetry_and_inverse-closedness_of_matrix_algebras_and_functional_calculus_for_infinite_matrices","286199959_Mean_squared_error_Love_it_or_leave_it_A_new_look_at_Signal_Fidelity_Measures","282921747_Spatially_distributed_sampling_and_reconstruction_of_high-dimensional_signals","269634058_Robust_Uncertainty_Principles_Exact_Signal_Frequency_Information","266619383_Sampling_and_Galerkin_reconstruction_in_reproducing_kernel_spaces","266544518_Multiuser_Optimization_Distributed_Algorithms_and_Error_Analysis","266539792_Harmonic_analysis_on_spaces_of_homogeneous_type_With_a_preface_by_Yves_Meyer","262981434_Sampling_Curves_With_Finite_Rate_of_Innovation","257478574_Dynamical_sampling_Time-space_trade-off","243080786_Wiener's_lemma_for_infinite_matrices","242144031_Nonuniform_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_in_Shift-Invariant_Spaces","239403778_Analyse_Harmonique_Non-Commutative_sur_Certain_Es-paces_Homogen'es","239222885_Exact_signal_reconstruction_from_highly_incomplete_frequency_information","238877890_An_Efficient_Algorithmic_Procedure_for_Obtaining_a_Minimum_L_infty_Norm_Solution_to_a_System_of_Consistent_Linear_Equations","238877850_A_Finite_Algorithm_for_the_Minimum_l_infty_Solution_to_a_System_of_Consistent_Linear_Equations","236136873_Localized_nonlinear_functional_equations_and_two_sampling_problems_in_signal_processing","234113920_Beyond_Consistent_Reconstructions_Optimality_and_Sharp_Bounds_for_Generalized_Sampling_and_Application_to_the_Uniform_Resampling_Problem","233407299_Spectral_Graph_Theory","232243124_Proprietes_des_matrices_bien_localisees_pres_de_leur_diagonale_et_quelques_applications","232243117_Wiener's_lemma_for_infinite_matrices_with_polynomial_off-diagonal_decay","232243116_Wiener's_lemma_for_localized_integral_operators","228383253_Symmetry_and_inverse-closedness_of_matrix_algebras_and_functional_calculus_for_infinite_matrices","227307154_Wiener's_Lemma_for_Infinite_Matrices_II","226081950_Wiener's_Lemma_Theme_and_Variations_An_Introduction_to_Spectral_Invariance_and_Its_Applications","224381249_Bovik_AC_Mean_squared_error_love_it_or_leave_it_-_A_new_look_at_signal_fidelity_measures_IEEE_Sig_Process_Mag_26_98-117","222828513_Sampling_and_reconstruction_of_signals_in_a_reproducing_kernel_subspace_of_L-PR-d","222653293_Slanted_matrices_Banach_frames_and_sampling","222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey","222409903_Fusion_Frames_and_Distributed_Processing","221933013_Incremental_Adaptive_Strategies_Over_Distributed_Networks","220390859_Frames_in_spaces_with_finite_rate_of_innovation","220390816_Characterization_of_local_sampling_sequences_for_spline_subspaces","220390737_Local_reconstruction_for_sampling_in_shift-invariant_spaces","220132364_Nonuniform_Average_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_of_Signals_with_Finite_Rate_of_Innovation","200673835_Metric_and_geometric_quasiconformality_in_Ahlfors_regular_Loewner_spaces","200524212_The_finite_section_method_and_problems_in_frame_theory"]}
