{"id":"317067821_Intertranslatability_of_Abstract_Argumentation_Frameworks","abstract":"At the heart of abstract argumentation lies the Dungâ€™s argumentation framework.\nOver the years, many of its extensions were proposed, ranging from the ones employing\nvarious strengths and preferences to those that focus on researching new types of relations\nbetween arguments. With such an amount of available structures, it is only natural to ask\nwhether one can move between the frameworks while still preserving the behavior of the\nsemantics, what would be the costs of such a process and what we gain or lose in it. The\naim of this work is to introduce new translations between the available frameworks and to\nrecall the existing ones when possible. Thus, our aim is to create a comprehensive study\non the intertranslatability of abstract argumentation frameworks. We also propose a translation\nclassification system and new transformation approaches for structures with support.\nFinally, we discuss the quality of our translations, point out what can be improved and if\npossible, show the limits of the enhancements we can make.","authors":["Sylwia Polberg"],"meta":["March 2017","Report number: DBAI-TR-2017-104"],"references":[]}
