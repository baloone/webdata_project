{"id":"316902678_Cross-domain_image_localization_by_adaptive_feature_fusion","abstract":"We address the problem of cross-domain image localization, i.e., the ability of estimating the pose of a landmark from visual content acquired under various conditions, such as old photographs, paintings, photos taken at a particular season, etc. We explore a 2D approach where the pose is estimated from geo-localized reference images that visually match the query image. This work focuses on the retrieval of similar images, which is a challenging task for images across different domains. We propose a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) framework that adaptively combines multiple image descriptions. A regression model is used to select the best feature combinations according to their spatial complementarity, globally for a whole dataset as well as adaptively for each given image. The framework is evaluated on different datasets and the experiments prove its advantage over classical retrieval approaches.","authors":["Neelanjan Bhowmik","Li Weng","Val√©rie Gouet-Brunet","Bahman Soheilian"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1109/JURSE.2017.7924572","Conference: 2017 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event (JURSE)"],"references":["307530130_GPS-denied_geo-localisation_using_visual_odometry","303093897_6-DOF_Image_Localization_from_Massive_Geo-tagged_Reference_Images","319770714_Photo_tourism_Exploring_photo_collections_in_3D","319770310_City-Scale_Location_Recognition","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","304409315_PoseNet_A_Convolutional_Network_for_Real-Time_6-DOF_Camera_Relocalization","282792083_Efficient_fusion_of_multidimensional_descriptors_for_image_retrieval","278705221_Comparison_on_Late_Fusion_Methods_of_Low_Level_Features_for_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval","277560717_Cross-Domain_Image_Retrieval_with_a_Dual_Attribute-Aware_Ranking_Network","268733104_Speeded-up_robust_features_SURF"]}
