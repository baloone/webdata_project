{"id":"322075697_Denoising_of_3D_magnetic_resonance_images_with_multi-channel_residual_learning_of_convolutional_neural_network","abstract":"Purpose: \nTo test if the proposed deep learning based denoising method denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNN) with residual learning and multi-channel strategy can denoise three dimensional MR images with Rician noise robustly.\n\nMaterials and methods: \nMulti-channel DnCNN (MCDnCNN) method with two training strategies was developed to denoise MR images with and without a specific noise level, respectively. To evaluate our method, three datasets from two public data sources of IXI dataset and Brainweb, including T1 weighted MR images acquired at 1.5 and 3 T as well as MR images simulated with a widely used MR simulator, were randomly selected and artificially added with different noise levels ranging from 1 to 15%. For comparison, four other state-of-the-art denoising methods were also tested using these datasets.\n\nResults: \nIn terms of the highest peak-signal-to-noise-ratio and global of structure similarity index, our proposed MCDnCNN model for a specific noise level showed the most robust denoising performance in all three datasets. Next to that, our general noise-applicable model also performed better than the rest four methods in two datasets. Furthermore, our training model showed good general applicability.\n\nConclusion: \nOur proposed MCDnCNN model has been demonstrated to robustly denoise three dimensional MR images with Rician noise.","authors":["Dongsheng Jiang","Weiqiang Dou","Luc Vosters","Xiayu Xu"],"meta":["December 2017Japanese Journal of Radiology 36(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11604-018-0758-8"],"references":["313452898_A_3D_MRI_denoising_algorithm_based_on_Bayesian_theory","306187437_Beyond_a_Gaussian_Denoiser_Residual_Learning_of_Deep_CNN_for_Image_Denoising","303040007_Global_denoising_for_3D_MRI","298798326_Simple_noise_reduction_for_diffusion_weighted_images","283954386_A_MRI_Denoising_Method_Based_on_3D_Nonlocal_Means_and_Multidimensional_PCA","282277944_Automatic_brain_MR_image_denoising_based_on_texture_feature-based_artificial_neural_networks","274487894_An_Optimized_LMMSE_based_Method_for_3D_MRI_Denoising","272200767_MRI_noise_estimation_and_denoising_using_non-local_PCA","266588202_The_EM_Method_in_a_Probabilistic_Wavelet-based_MRI_Denoising","265556805_Denoising_of_3D_Magnetic_Resonance_Images_by_Using_Higher-Order_Singular_Value_Decomposition","263130330_Denoising_MR_Images_Using_Non-Local_Means_Filter_with_Combined_Patch_and_Pixel_Similarity","260412553_Robust_Brain_MRI_Denoising_and_Segmentation_Using_Enhanced_non-local_Means_Algorithm","43401208_An_Optimized_Blockwise_Nonlocal_Means_Denoising_Filter_for_3-D_Magnetic_Resonance_Images","5422326_3D_Wavelet_Sub-Bands_Mixing_for_Image_Denoising","327804465_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Classification","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","307434370_Global_denoising_for_3D_MRI","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","278733352_Deep_Generative_Image_Models_using_a_Laplacian_Pyramid_of_Adversarial_Networks","275718026_A_Majorize-Minimize_Framework_for_Rician_and_Non-Central_Chi_MR_Images","256467911_Laplacian_based_non-local_means_denoising_of_MR_images_with_Rician_noise","51125452_MRI_denoising_based_on_Sparseness_and_Self-Similarity","14601371_The_Rician_distribution_of_noisy_MRI_Data"]}
