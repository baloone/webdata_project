{"id":"226628893_Spatial_Data_Mining","abstract":"Spatial Data Mining is the process of discovering interesting and previously unknown, but potentially useful patterns from\nlarge spatial datasets. Extracting interesting and useful patterns from spatial datasets is more difficult than extracting\nthe corresponding patterns from traditional numeric and categorical data due to the complexity of spatial data types, spatial\nrelationships, and spatial autocorrelation. This chapter provides an overview on the unique features that distinguish spatial\ndata mining from classical Data Mining, and presents major accomplishments of spatial Data Mining research.","authors":["Shashi Shekhar","Pusheng Zhang","Yan Huang"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.1007/0-387-25465-X_39","In book: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook (pp.833-851)"],"references":["319393723_Fast_algorithms_for_mining_association_rules","314731688_Outliers_in_Statistical_Data","313757008_Modelling_Spatial_Patterns","312975482_Exploratory_spatial_data_analysis_and_geographic_information_systems","275904204_Development_Geography_and_Economic_Theory","275774734_Identification_of_Outliers","270254975_Statistics_for_Spatial_Data_Revised","270053689_Spatial_Econometrics_Methods_and_Models","268493544_Identification_of_Outliers","267988168_A_Regression_Method_for_Spatial_Disease_Rates_An_Estimating_Function_Approach","265350354_Cellular_Geography","265259380_An_Introduction_to_Spatial_Databases","247646422_Statistics_for_Spatial_Data_revised_ed_New_York_Wiley","247088416_Outliers_In_Statistical_Data","245255162_Algorithms_for_Clustering_Data_Prentice_Hall"]}
