{"id":"306167325_Synthesis_of_reactive_systems","abstract":"These lecture notes trace the developments triggered by Church's classic synthesis problem from the early solutions in the 1960s to the practical tools that have come out in the past few years. The article gives an overview on the automata- and game-theoretic foundations of the synthesis problem. We then explore the spectrum of logics for the synthesis of reactive systems, from reduced logics, like GR(1), to advanced logics such as strategy and coordination logic. Finally, we discuss the ideas behind recent synthesis approaches, like bounded synthesis and symbolic and SAT-based methods.","authors":["B.
