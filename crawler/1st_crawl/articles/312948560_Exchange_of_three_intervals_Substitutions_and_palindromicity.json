{"id":"312948560_Exchange_of_three_intervals_Substitutions_and_palindromicity","abstract":"We study purely morphic words coding symmetric non-degenerate three interval exchange transformation which are known to be palindromic, i.e., they contain infinitely many palindromes. We prove that such words are fixed by a conjugate to a morphism of class , that is, a morphism such that each letter is mapped to where and are both palindromes. We thus provide a new family of palindromic infinite words satisfying the conjecture of Hof, Knill and Simon. Given a morphism fixing such word, we give a formula to determine the parameters of the underlying three interval exchange and the intercept of the word.","authors":["Zuzana Masáková","Edita Pelantova","Štěpán Starosta"],"meta":["May 2017European Journal of Combinatorics 62:217-231","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2017.01.003"],"references":["312073776_Itineraries_induced_by_exchange_of_three_intervals","273471744_Interval_Exchange_Words_and_the_Question_of_Hof_Knill_and_Simon","268247171_On_Sturmian_sequences_which_are_invariant_under_some_substitutions","265632240_Some_properties_of_abelian_return_words","255576079_Languages_of_k-interval_exchange_transformations","228942235_Characterization_of_Substitution_Invariant_Words_Coding_Exchange_of_Three_Intervals","225515022_Structure_of_three_interval_exchange_transformations_II_A_combinatorial_description_of","220165390_Morphisms_fixing_words_associated_with_exchange_of_three_intervals","2618431_Singular_Continuous_Spectrum_for_Palindromic_Schrodinger_Operators","2216428_Sturm_Numbers_and_Substitution_Invariance_of_3iet_Words","287370913_Sturmian_Sequences_and_Invertible_Substitutions","268550152_Une_generalisation_du_developpement_en_fraction_continue","266240247_On_the_number_of_return_words_in_infinite_words_constructed_by_interval_exchange_transformations","266204201_Palindromic_sequences_generated_from_marked_morphisms","258230063_Topological_dynamics","246871414_Morphismes_sturmiens_et_regles_de_Rauzy","246546830_A_Counterexample_to_a_Question_of_Hof_Knill_and_Simon","245680755_Codages_de_rotations_et_ph'enomenes_d''autosimilarit'e","242764616_Palindromic_lacunas_of_the_Thue-Morse_word","239955944_Echanges_d'intervalles_et_transformations_induites","226587858_Interval_exchange_transformations","225976012_Interval_exchange_transformations","223125340_Mirror_substitutions_and_palindromic_sequences","222548175_A_Characterization_of_Sturmian_Words_by_Return_Words","220975430_On_the_Conjugation_of_Standard_Morphisms","220148456_Palindromic_complexity_of_codings_of_rotations"]}
