{"id":"323133671_Stream_Processing_Dual-Track_CGRA_for_Object_Inference","abstract":"With the development of machine learning technology, the exploration of energy-efficient and flexible architectures for object inference algorithms is of growing interest in recent years. However, not many publications concentrate on a coarsegrained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) for object inference algorithms. This paper provides a stream processing, dual-track programming CGRA-based approach to address the inherent computing characteristics of algorithms in object inference. Based on the proposed approach, an architecture called stream dual-track CGRA (SDT-CGRA) is presented as an implementation prototype. To evaluate the performance, the SDT-CGRA is realized in Verilog HDL and implemented in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation 55-nm process, with the footprint of 5.19 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nat 450 MHz. Seven object inference algorithms, including convolutional neural network (CNN), k-means, principal component analysis (PCA), spatial pyramid matching (SPM), linear support vector machine (SVM), Softmax, and Joint Bayesian, are selected as benchmarks. The experimental results show that the SDT-CGRA can gain on average 343.8 times and 17.7 times higher energy efficiency for Softmax, PCA, and CNN, 621.0 times and 1261.8 times higher energy efficiency for k-means, SPM, linear-SVM, and Joint-Bayesian algorithms when compared with the Intel Xeon E5-2637 CPU and the Nvidia TitanX graphics processing unit. When compared with the state-of-the-art solutions of AlexNet on field-programmable gate array and CGRA, the proposed SDT-CGRA can achieve a 1.78 times increase in energy efficiency and a 13 times speedup, respectively.","authors":["Xitian Fan","Di Wu","Wei Cao","Wayne Luk"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems PP(99):1-14","DOI:10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2797600"],"references":["319856813_In-Datacenter_Performance_Analysis_of_a_Tensor_Processing_Unit","318025612_A_Multithreaded_CGRA_for_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Processing","317613363_In-Datacenter_Performance_Analysis_of_a_Tensor_Processing_Unit","316077428_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Architecture_With_Reconfigurable_Computation_Patterns","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","292869497_Eyeriss_An_Energy-Efficient_Reconfigurable_Accelerator_for_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","273081081_Scalable_crossbar_network_a_non-blocking_interconnection_network_for_large-scale_systems","269211398_A_Fully_Pipelined_and_Dynamically_Composable_Architecture_of_CGRA","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","261119155_Applying_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_concepts_to_hybrid_NN-HMM_model_for_speech_recognition","259286614_BilRC_An_Execution_Triggered_Coarse_Grained_Reconfigurable_Architecture","258381977_A_Coarse-Grained_Reconfigurable_Architecture_with_Compilation_for_High_Performance","237222052_A_High_Performance_FPGA-Based_Accelerator_for_BLAS_Library_Implementation","225761164_SURF_Speeded_up_robust_features","224128061_EGRA_A_Coarse_Grained_Reconfigurable_Architectural_Template","221405546_Architectural_Exploration_of_the_ADRES_Coarse-Grained_Reconfigurable_Array","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","221340963_Design_and_implementation_of_a_rendering_algorithm_in_a_SIMD_reconfigurable_architecture_MorphoSys","221060231_Synthesis_of_synchronous_elastic_architectures","220659463_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_VOC_challenge","220423225_Roofline_An_Insightful_Visual_Performance_Model_for_Multicore_Architectures","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","319372030_A_106-to-509_TOPSW_reconfigurable_hybrid-neural-network_processor_for_deep_learning_applications","314296599_142_DNPU_An_81TOPSW_reconfigurable_CNN-RNN_processor_for_general-purpose_deep_neural_networks","312448985_DaDianNao_A_machine-learning_supercomputer","309142325_Cambricon_An_Instruction_Set_Architecture_for_Neural_Networks","308871961_DT-CGRA_Dual-track_coarse-grained_reconfigurable_architecture_for_stream_applications","308834204_A_CGRA-Based_Approach_for_Accelerating_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","308822832_A_high_performance_FPGA-based_accelerator_for_large-scale_convolutional_neural_networks","305994966_Deep_Survival_Analysis","305540233_Erratum_An_Energy-Efficient_Coarse-Grained_Reconfigurable_Processing_Unit_for_Multiple-Standard_Video_Decoding_IEEE_Transactions_on_Multimedia_2015_1710_1706-1720","301367952_Optimizing_FPGA-based_Accelerator_Design_for_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","283024298_DaDianNao_A_Machine-Learning_Supercomputer","281896486_An_Energy-Efficient_Coarse-Grained_Reconfigurable_Processing_Unit_for_Multiple-Standard_Video_Decoding","280082402_ShiDianNao_shifting_vision_processing_closer_to_the_sensor","277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","266912085_Computer_System_Design_System_on_a_Chip","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","262294970_Bayesian_Face_Revisited_A_Joint_Formulation","262174473_Convolution_Engine_Balancing_Efficiency_and_Flexibility_in_Specialized_Computing","260331671_DySER_Unifying_Functionality_and_Parallelism_Specialization_for_Energy-Efficient_Computing","222853341_Parameterisation_to_tailor_commodity_clusters_to_applications","221363206_A_Discriminatively_Trained_Multiscale_Deformable_Part_Model","220884856_A_Programmable_Parallel_Accelerator_for_Learning_and_Classification","4246227_Beyond_Bags_of_Features_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Recognizing_Natural_Scene_Categories"]}
