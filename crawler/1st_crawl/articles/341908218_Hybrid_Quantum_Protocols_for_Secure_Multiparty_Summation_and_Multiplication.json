{"id":"341908218_Hybrid_Quantum_Protocols_for_Secure_Multiparty_Summation_and_Multiplication","abstract":"The summation and multiplication are two basic operations for secure multiparty quantum computation. The existing secure multiparty quantum summation and multiplication protocols have (n, n) threshold approach and their computation type is bit-by-bit, where n is total number of players. In this paper, we propose two hybrid (t, n) threshold quantum protocols for secure multiparty summation and multiplication based on the Shamir’s secret sharing, SUM gate, quantum fourier transform, and generalized Pauli operator, where t is a threshold number of players that can perform the summation and multiplication. Their computation type is secret-by-secret with modulo d, where d, n ≤ d ≤ 2n, is a prime. The proposed protocols can resist the intercept-resend, entangle-measure, collusion, collective, and coherent quantum attacks. They have better computation as well as communication costs and no player can get other player’s private input.","authors":["Kartick Sutradhar","Hari Om"],"meta":["June 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-65871-8"],"references":["333906188_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_for_Summation_and_Multiplication_with_Mutually_Unbiased_Bases","324658413_Secure_multi-party_quantum_summation_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","318755023_Quantum_solution_to_a_class_of_two-party_private_summation_problems","317934887_An_Novel_Protocol_for_the_Quantum_Secure_Multi-Party_Summation_Based_on_Two-Particle_Bell_States","291420684_Secure_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_for_Summation_and_Multiplication","347783970_Secure_multiparty_quantum_summation","313321156_Multi-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party_based_on_single_particles","276455918_Three-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party","260456504_High-Capacity_Quantum_Summation_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","238660293_INVERSE_OF_THE_VANDERMONDE_MATRIX_W1TH_APPLICATIONS"]}
