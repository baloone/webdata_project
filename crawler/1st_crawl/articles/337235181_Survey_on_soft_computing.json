{"id":"337235181_Survey_on_soft_computing","abstract":"Soft computing triggers a revolutionary change in the field of computer science and technology. How did soft computing evolve? What is soft computing application situation? Which fields are soft computing widely used? Which fields does soft computing still need popularizing? All of these problems resort to the survey on the development of soft computing.","authors":["Yun Liang","Tian-ping He"],"meta":["January 2020Soft Computing 24(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-019-04508-z"],"references":["319543756_Magnesium_and_Magnesium_Alloys","315712860_Magnesium_and_magnesium_alloys","315384966_Studies_in_Fuzziness_and_Soft_Computing","296758683_DNA_computing_and_soft_computing","291138160_Assessing_value_classification_of_oil_and_gas_reserve_based_on_support_vector_machine","290524383_Research_and_development_of_fault_intelligent_diagnosis_based_on_models","260688952_Making_computers_think_like_people_The_term_fuzzy_thinkingA_is_pejorative_when_applied_to_humans_but_fuzzy_logic_is_an_asset_to_machines_in_applications_from_expert_systems_to_process_control","257610951_Mechanical_and_microstructural_properties_prediction_by_artificial_neural_networks_in_FSW_processes_of_dual_phase_titanium_alloys","257376936_Prediction_of_welding-induced_angular_distortions_in_thin_butt-welded_plates_using_artificial_neural_networks","243598210_Making_Computers_Think_Like_People","240635786_Soft_Computing_Methods_in_Human_Sciences","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","220093051_Soft_Computing_and_Fuzzy_Logic","5596012_Rough-Fuzzy_MLP_Knowledge_Encoding_and_Classification","3455649_Toward_Human_Level_Machine_Intelligence_-_Is_It_Achievable_The_Need_for_a_Paradigm_Shift"]}
