{"id":"283279914_Distributed_Communication_in_Bare-Bones_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"We consider wireless networks in which the effects of interference are\ndetermined by the SINR model. We address the question of structuring\ndistributed communication when stations have very limited individual\ncapabilities. In particular, nodes do not know their geographic coordinates,\nneighborhoods or even the size~$n$ of the network, nor can they sense\ncollisions. Each node is equipped only with its unique name from a range $\\{1,\n\\dots, N\\}$. We study the following three settings and distributed algorithms\nfor communication problems in each of them. In the uncoordinated-start case,\nwhen one node starts an execution and other nodes are awoken by receiving\nmessages from already awoken nodes, we present a randomized broadcast algorithm\nwhich wakes up all the nodes in $O(n \\log^2 N)$ rounds with high probability.\nIn the synchronized-start case, when all the nodes simultaneously start an\nexecution, we give a randomized algorithm that computes a backbone of the\nnetwork in $O(\\Delta\\log^{7} N)$ rounds with high probability. Finally, in the\npartly-coordinated-start case, when a number of nodes start an execution\ntogether and other nodes are awoken by receiving messages from the already\nawoken nodes, we develop an algorithm that creates a backbone network in time\n$O(n\\log^2 N +\\Delta\\log^{7} N)$ with high probability.","authors":["Bogdan S Chlebus","Dariusz Kowalski","Shailesh Vaya"],"meta":["November 2021Distributed Computing","DOI:10.1007/s00446-021-00413-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["336940932_Broadcast_in_the_Ad_Hoc_SINR_Model","335576455_Distributed_Dominating_Set_and_Connected_Dominating_Set_Construction_Under_the_Dynamic_SINR_Model","313481424_Deterministic_Protocols_in_the_SINR_Model_without_Knowledge_of_Coordinates","311491109_Distributed_communication_in_bare-bones_wireless_networks","308808979_On_setting-up_asynchronous_ad_hoc_wireless_networks","305676081_Brief_Announcement_Data_Dissemination_in_Unified_Dynamic_Wireless_Networks","305660919_Brief_Announcement_Multi-Broadcasting_under_the_SINR_Model","303226526_Distributed_Randomized_Broadcasting_in_Wireless_Networks_under_the_SINR_Model","300251303_Nearly_Optimal_Local_Broadcasting_in_the_SINR_Model_with_Feedback","299669336_On_Local_Broadcasting_Schedules_and_CONGEST_Algorithms_in_the_SINR_Model","276922957_A_Local_Broadcast_Layer_for_the_SINR_Network_Model","289823416_Broadcast_in_the_Ad_Hoc_SINR_Model","283072219_Distributed_Randomized_Broadcasting_in_Wireless_Networks_under_the_SINR_Model","274730735_Multi-Broadcasting_under_the_SINR_Model","273186751_Efficiency_of_Wireless_Networks_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Physical_Interference_Model"]}
