{"id":"315348067_Collection_and_characterization_of_grapevine_genetic_resources_Vitis_vinifera_in_the_Holy_Land_towards_the_renewal_of_ancient_winemaking_practices","abstract":"The importance and extent of wine consumption in all life aspects at the Holy Land is well documented. The Muslim influence in this region led to the abandonment of winemaking practices, and possible loss of indigenous wine varieties. Here we present a country wide collection of the local grapevine population including wild and cultivated forms, and its characterization by genetic, ampelographic and enological methods. The ampelographic analysis shows clear differences between Sativa and Sylvestris groups in flower, leaf and cluster parameters, and that most Sativa belong to proles orientalis. Genetic population analysis was conducted by analyzing 22 common SSR markers, determining first the unique genotypes, and internally assessing the populationâ€™s structure, showing the existence of two distinct Sativa and Sylvestris populations, and a third mixed one. Likewise, the relationship between the Israeli grapevine population and grapevine populations in Europe and parts of Asia was investigated, showing that the Israeli Sativa and Sylvestris populations cluster closely together, suggesting a common genetic source. Lastly, the enological characteristics of selected Sativa and Sylvestris genotypes are presented, demonstrating their potential for quality wine production. This research significantly contributes toward the re-establishment of indigenous and traditional local grapevine varieties into the modern international wine industry.","authors":["Elyashiv Drori","Oshrit Rahimi","Annarita Marrano","Yakov Henig"],"meta":["March 2017Scientific Reports 7(1):44463","DOI:10.1038/srep44463","Project: local israely grapevined varieties"],"references":["284726993_Genetic_diversity_and_relationships_in_the_grapevine_germplasm_collection_from_Central_Asia","283615234_Domestication_of_Plants_in_the_Old_World_-_The_Origin_and_Spread_of_Domesticated_Plants_in_South-west_Asia_Europe_and_the_Mediterranean_Basin","281061165_Ampelographic_and_genetic_characterization_of_an_initial_Israeli_grapevine_germplasm_collection","274698257_Characterization_of_Vitis_vinifera_L_subspecies_sylvestris_Gmelin_Hegi_in_the_Ebro_river_Basin_Spain","265689450_Italian_wild_grapevine_Vitis_vinifera_L_subsp_sylvestris_population_insights_into_eco-geographical_aspects_and_genetic_structure","313159598_Inference_of_Population_Structure_Using_Multilocus_Genotype_Data","287239757_Ancient_wine_The_search_for_the_origins_of_viniculture","285526496_Introduction_to_wine_laboratory_practices_and_procedures","274246934_Presses_for_Oil_and_Wine_in_the_Southern_Levant_in_the_Byzantine_Period","262994348_Abscisic_Acid_Content_and_Osmotic_Relations_of_Salt-Stressed_Grapevine_Leaves","259956747_Molecular_Identification_and_Genetic_Relationships_of_Palestinian_Grapevine_Cultivars","239744842_A_catalogue_of_wild_relatives_of_cultivated_plants_native_to_Europe","236146371_Production_of_Anthocyanins_in_Grape_Cell_Cultures_A_Potential_Source_of_Raw_Material_for_Pharmaceutical_Food_and_Cosmetic_Industries","236051481_Genetic_diversity_and_population_structure_assessed_by_SSR_and_SNP_markers_in_a_large_germplasm_collection_of_grape","235439643_Genetic_structure_in_cultivated_grapevines_is_linked_to_geography_and_human_selection"]}
