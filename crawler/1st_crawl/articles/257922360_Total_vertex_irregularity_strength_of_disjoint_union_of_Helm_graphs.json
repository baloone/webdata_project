{"id":"257922360_Total_vertex_irregularity_strength_of_disjoint_union_of_Helm_graphs","abstract":"A total vertex irregular k-labeling φ of a graph G is a labeling of the vertices and edges of G with labels from the set {1,2,⋯,k} in such a way that for any two different vertices x and y their weights wt(x) and wt(y) are distinct. Here, the weight of a vertex x in G is the sum of the label of x and the labels of all edges incident with the vertex x. The minimum k for which the graph G has a vertex irregular total k-labeling is called the total vertex irregularity strength of G. We have determined an exact value of the total vertex irregularity strength of disjoint union of Helm graphs.","authors":["Ali Ahmad","Edy Tri Baskoro","Muhammad Imran"],"meta":["January 2012Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory","DOI:10.7151/dmgt.1619"],"references":["262691706_On_vertex_irregular_total_labelings","234055343_Total_vertex_irregularity_strength_of_wheel_related_graphs","267124343_Total_vertex_irregular_labelings_of_wheels_fans_suns_and_frienship_graphs","262256051_Note_The_irregularity_strength_of_K_mm_is_4_for_odd_m","256157681_Irregular_networks_regular_graphs_and_integer_matrices_with_distinct_row_and_column_sums","245426469_A_new_upper_bound_for_the_total_vertex_irregularity_strength_of_graphs","234058028_Total_vertex_irregular_labeling_of_complete_bipartite_graphs","228526618_On_graph_irregularity_strength","220549005_On_the_irregularity_strength_of_trees","220533318_Linear_Bound_on_the_Irregularity_Strength_and_the_Total_Vertex_Irregularity_Strength_of_Graphs"]}
