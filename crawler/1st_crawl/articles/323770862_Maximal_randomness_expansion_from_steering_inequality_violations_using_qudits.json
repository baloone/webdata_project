{"id":"323770862_Maximal_randomness_expansion_from_steering_inequality_violations_using_qudits","abstract":"We consider the generation of randomness based upon the observed violation of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering inequality, known as one-sided device-independent randomness expansion. We show that in the simplest scenario -- involving only two parties applying two measurements with $d$ outcomes each -- that there exist EPR steering inequalities whose maximal violation certifies the maximal amount of randomness, equal to log(d) bits. We further show that all pure partially entangled full-Schmidt-rank states in all dimensions can achieve maximal violation of these inequalities, and thus lead to maximal randomness expansion in the one-sided device-independent setting. More generally, the amount of randomness that can be certified is given by a semidefinite program, which we use to study the behaviour for non-maximal violations of the inequalities.","authors":["Paul Skrzypczyk","Daniel Cavalcanti"],"meta":["March 2018Physical Review Letters 120(26)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.260401"],"references":["323684948_Multidimensional_quantum_entanglement_with_large-scale_integrated_optics","309738760_Randomness_in_Quantum_Mechanics_Philosophy_Physics_and_Technology","305389041_Bell_inequalities_for_maximally_entangled_states","301899096_Quantum_Random_Number_Generators","275669345_Optimal_randomness_certification_in_the_quantum_steering_and_prepare-and-measure_scenarios","263020530_Quantum_randomness_extraction_for_various_levels_of_characterization_of_the_devices","227343731_Certifiable_quantum_dice","51959340_Security_of_practical_private_randomness_generation","51939255_One-sided_Device-Independent_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Securityfeasibility_and_the_connection_with_steering","43148427_Random_Numbers_Certified_by_Bell's_Theorem","11558079_Bell_Inequalities_for_Arbitrarily_High-Dimensional_Systems","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","318845004_Universal_Security_for_Randomness_Expansion_from_the_Spot-Checking_Protocol","311470621_Certified_randomness_in_quantum_physics","309470733_Robust_Protocols_for_Securely_Expanding_Randomness_and_Distributing_Keys_Using_Untrusted_Quantum_Devices","305006987_Simple_and_Tight_Device-Independent_Security_Proofs","301835340_Quantum_steering_a_short_review_with_focus_on_semidefinite_programming","281393356_Loss-tolerant_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_steering_for_arbitrary-dimensional_states_Joint_measurability_and_unbounded_violations_under_losses","259783181_Randomness_extraction_from_quantum_systems_with_different_levels_of_trust_in_the_working_of_the_devices","258052473_Infinite_Randomness_Expansion_and_Amplification_with_a_Constant_Number_of_Devices","236651628_Negativity_and_steering_A_stronger_Peres_conjecture","235903572_Bell_nonlocality","229058134_Convex_Optimization","200703048_Can_Quantum-Mechanical_Description_of_Physical_Reality_Be_Considered_Complete","47819734_Private_Randomness_Expansion_With_Untrusted_Devices","6331409_Steering_Entanglement_Nonlocality_and_the_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_Paradox"]}
