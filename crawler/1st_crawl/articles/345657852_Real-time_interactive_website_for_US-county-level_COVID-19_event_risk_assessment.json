{"id":"345657852_Real-time_interactive_website_for_US-county-level_COVID-19_event_risk_assessment","abstract":"Large events and gatherings, particularly those taking place indoors, have been linked to multitransmission events that have accelerated the pandemic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To provide real-time, geolocalized risk information, we developed an interactive online dashboard that estimates the risk that at least one individual with SARS-CoV-2 is present in gatherings of different sizes in the United States. The website combines documented case reports at the county level with ascertainment bias information obtained via population-wide serological surveys to estimate real-time circulating, per-capita infection rates. These rates are updated daily as a means to visualize the risk associated with gatherings, including county maps and state-level plots. The website provides data-driven information to help individuals and policy makers make prudent decisions (for example, increasing mask-wearing compliance and avoiding larger gatherings) that could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in hard-hit regions.","authors":["Aroon Chande","Seolha Lee","Mallory Harris","Quan Nguyen"],"meta":["December 2020Nature Human Behaviour 4(12):1-7","DOI:10.1038/s41562-020-01000-9"],"references":["343802799_Estimating_unobserved_SARS-CoV-2_infections_in_the_United_States","343296153_Reopening_Primary_Schools_during_the_Pandemic","343131887_Reconciling_early-outbreak_estimates_of_the_basic_reproductive_number_and_its_uncertainty_framework_and_applications_to_the_novel_coronavirus_SARS-CoV-2_outbreak","343115003_Seroprevalence_of_Antibodies_to_SARS-CoV-2_in_10_Sites_in_the_United_States_March_23-May_12_2020","342689234_Chopping_the_tail_how_preventing_superspreading_can_help_to_maintain_COVID-19_control","342559600_Suppression_of_a_SARS-CoV-2_outbreak_in_the_Italian_municipality_of_Vo'","342336181_Reconstruction_of_Transmission_Pairs_for_Novel_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_in_Mainland_China_Estimation_of_Superspreading_Events_Serial_Interval_and_Hazard_of_Infection","342182508_Report_9_Impact_of_non-pharmaceutical_interventions_NPIs_to_reduce_COVID-19_mortality_and_healthcare_demand","341777581_Spread_of_COVID-19_through_Georgia_USA_Near-term_projections_and_impacts_of_social_distancing_via_a_metapopulation_model","341759437_Socioeconomic_disparities_in_subway_use_and_COVID-19_outcomes_in_New_York_City","341096891_The_flow_physics_of_COVID-19","340033724_Identifying_and_Interrupting_Superspreading_Events-Implications_for_Control_of_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_2","339964860_Substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates_the_rapid_dissemination_of_novel_coronavirus_SARS-CoV2","340215637_COVID-19_Biomedical_research_in_a_world_under_social-distancing_measures","340214784_Turbulent_Gas_Clouds_and_Respiratory_Pathogen_Emissions_Potential_Implications_for_Reducing_Transmission_of_COVID-19"]}
