{"id":"348458849_Image_reconstruction_through_a_multimode_fiber_with_a_simple_neural_network_architecture","abstract":"Multimode fibers (MMFs) have the potential to carry complex images for endoscopy and related applications, but decoding the complex speckle patterns produced by mode-mixing and modal dispersion in MMFs is a serious challenge. Several groups have recently shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained to perform high-fidelity MMF image reconstruction. We find that a considerably simpler neural network architecture, the single hidden layer dense neural network, performs at least as well as previously-used CNNs in terms of image reconstruction fidelity, and is superior in terms of training time and computing resources required. The trained networks can accurately reconstruct MMF images collected over a week after the cessation of the training set, with the dense network performing as well as the CNN over the entire period.","authors":["Changyan Zhu","Eng Aik Chan","You Wang","Weina Peng"],"meta":["January 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-79646-8"],"references":["346860503_Robust_position_sensing_with_wave_fingerprints_in_dynamic_complex_propagation_environments","342962737_Actor_neural_networks_for_the_robust_control_of_partially_measured_nonlinear_systems_showcased_for_image_propagation_through_diffuse_media","337543770_Space_division_multiplexing_in_standard_multi-mode_optical_fibers_based_on_speckle_pattern_classification","336960054_Imaging_through_multimode_fibers_using_deep_learning_The_effects_of_intensity_versus_holographic_recording_of_the_speckle_pattern","334259554_Long-range_spatio-temporal_correlations_in_multimode_fibers_for_pulse_delivery","354241625_High-speed_multimode_fiber_imaging_system_based_on_conditional_generative_adversarial_network","340146318_Controlling_spatiotemporal_nonlinearities_in_multimode_fibers_with_deep_neural_networks","336622880_Learning_Spatiotemporal_Nonlinearities_in_Graded-Index_Multimode_Fibers_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","334345352_Deep_learning_the_high_variability_and_randomness_inside_multimode_fibers","333298438_Image_reconstruction_through_dynamic_scattering_media_based_on_deep_learning"]}
