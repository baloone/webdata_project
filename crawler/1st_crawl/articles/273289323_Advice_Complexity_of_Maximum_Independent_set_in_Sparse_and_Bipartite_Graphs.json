{"id":"273289323_Advice_Complexity_of_Maximum_Independent_set_in_Sparse_and_Bipartite_Graphs","abstract":"We study the advice complexity of the online version of the Maximum Independent Set problem, restricted to the sparse, and bipartite graphs, respectively. We show that for sparse graphs, constant-sized advice is sufficient to obtain a constant competitive ratio, whereas for bipartite graphs, only competitive ratio Omega(log(n/a)/loglog(n/a)) can be obtained with an advice of size a > loglogn. However, competitive ratio O(logn) can be achieved with advice O(loglogn).","authors":["Stefan Dobrev","Rastislav Královič","Richard Královič"],"meta":["January 2014Theory of Computing Systems 56(1):197-219","DOI:10.1007/s00224-014-9592-2"],"references":["257379911_On-line_graph_coloring_of_mathbbP_5-free_graphs","256737425_Online_Coloring_of_Bipartite_Graphs_with_and_without_Advice","240745501_ON-LINE_MAXIMUM_INDEPENDENT_SET_IN_CHORDAL_GRAPHS","234784007_Amortized_efficiency_of_list_update_paging_rules","226657157_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_Online_Problems","226242568_Trade-offs_Between_the_Size_of_Advice_and_Broadcasting_Time_in_Trees","226184013_Semi-Online_Preemptive_Scheduling_One_Algorithm_for_All_Variants","225955009_Online_Independent_Sets","221513054_On-Line_Maximum-Order_Induces_Hereditary_Subgraph_Problems","220975711_Information_Complexity_of_Online_Problems","220780519_Online_Coloring_Known_Graphs","220544286_Local_MST_Computation_with_Short_Advice","220397650_Vertex_Colouring_and_Forbidden_Subgraphs_-_A_Survey","220342632_Online_Coloring_Known_Graphs","29603113_Distributed_Computing_with_Advice_Information_Sensitivity_of_Graph_Coloring","2500035_Lower_Bounds_for_On-line_Graph_Problems_with_Application_to_On-line_Circuit_and_Optical_Routing","312627367_Online_independent_sets","262238486_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","231178767_On-line_models_and_algorithms_for_max_independent_set","229699907_On-line_and_first-fit_coloring_of_graphs","225586332_On-Line_Maximum-Order_Induced_Hereditary_Subgraph_Problems","225551944_Drawing_Maps_with_Advice","225492195_On_the_Advice_Complexity_of_the_k-Server_Problem","222692430_Communication_algorithms_with_advice","222431035_Tree_exploration_with_advice","222411454_Fast_Radio_Broadcasting_with_Advice","221233806_Drawing_Maps_with_Advice","220898782_Online_Computation_with_Advice","220689517_Online_Computation_and_Competitive_Analyses","220197489_On-line_graph_coloring_of_P","220165528_Measuring_the_problem-relevant_information_in_input","47842313_Randomized_on-line_algorithms_and_lower_bounds_for_computing_large_independent_sets_in_disk_graphs","2284562_Online_Interval_Scheduling"]}
