{"id":"282307709_A_hybrid_morphing_NACA4412_airfoil_concept","abstract":"This paper details the design and development of a hybrid actuator system combining surface actuated Shape memory alloys (SMAs) and trailing-edge Macro fibre composites (MFCs) for a NACA 4412 airfoil. This design allows both for a high-frequent (â‰ˆ 100 Hz) low-displacement actuation as well as a low-frequent large-displacement actuation. The design of the actuator system is highlighted, the simulation model is described and the test-setup is illustrated. Preliminary results are promising regarding the control of the desired lift.","authors":["Johannes Scheller","Karl-Joseph Rizzo","Gurvan Jodin","Eric Duhayon"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICIT.2015.7125385","Project: Electroactive hybrid morphing, application to Airbus A320 wings."],"references":["274706683_Morphing_Winglets_for_Aircraft_Multi-Phase_Improvement","266577774_Electromechanical_Modeling_of_Piezoelectric_Energy_Harvesters","252834340_Development_and_whirl_tower_test_of_the_SMART_active_flap_rotor","239547388_ANALYSIS_AND_DESIGN_OF_A_HYPER-ELLIPTICAL_CAMBERED_SPAN_MORPHING_AIRCRAFT_WING","231122591_On_the_role_of_thermoelectric_heat_transfer_in_the_design_of_SMA_actuators_Theoretical_modeling_and_experiment","228531008_Morphing_Trailing_Edges_with_Shape_Memory_Alloy_Rods","221785999_Natural_Heat-Sinking_Control_Method_for_High-Speed_Actuation_of_the_SMA","23614531_Aeroservoelastic_and_Structural_Dynamics_Research_on_Smart_Structures_Conducted_at_NASA_Langley_Research_Center","290391684_Activation_d'une_voilure_deformable_par_des_cables_d'AMF_repartis_en_surface","288655937_Macro_Fiber_Composites_and_Substrate_Materials_for_MAV_Wing_Morphing","272609010_Hybrid_Electroactive_Wings_Morphing_for_Aeronautic_Applications","262180638_Electromechanical_Modeling_of_Piezoelectric_Energy_Harvesters","260807256_Trailing-edge_dynamics_and_morphing_of_a_deformable_flat_plate_at_high_Reynolds_number_by_time-resolved_PIV","252184539_Design_and_testing_of_a_double_X-frame_piezoelectric_actuator","245022535_Piezoelectric_Energy_Harvesting_from_Macro-Fiber_Composites_with_an_Application_to_Morphing-Wing_Aircrafts","232411550_Shape_control_of_NITINOL-reinforced_composite_beams","231119691_Model_for_resistance_evolution_in_shape_memory_alloys_including_R-phase","231057194_Macro-Fiber_Composite_actuated_simply_supported_thin_airfoils","230963706_Robust_control_of_a_shape_memory_alloy_wire_actuated_flap","230939551_Analytical_development_of_single_crystal_Macro_Fiber_Composite_actuators_for_active_twist_rotor_blades","230917059_Design_of_a_High_Efficiency_Large_Stroke_Electromechanical_Actuator","229231994_NITINOL-reinforced_plates_Part_I_Thermal_characteristics","225117468_A_Novel_SMA-based_Concept_for_Airfoil_Structural_Morphing","222360957_An_accurate_self-sensing_method_for_the_control_of_shape_memory_alloy_actuated_flexures","37605059_Active_Fiber_Composites_for_Structural_Actuation"]}
