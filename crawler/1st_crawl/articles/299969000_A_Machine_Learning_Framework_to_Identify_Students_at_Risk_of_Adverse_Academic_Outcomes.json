{"id":"299969000_A_Machine_Learning_Framework_to_Identify_Students_at_Risk_of_Adverse_Academic_Outcomes","abstract":"Many school districts have developed successful intervention programs to help students graduate high school on time. However, identifying and prioritizing students who need those interventions the most remains challenging. This paper describes a machine learning framework to identify such students, discusses features that are useful for this task, applies several classification algorithms, and evaluates them using metrics important to school administrators. To help test this framework and make it practically useful, we partnered with two U.S. school districts with a combined enrollment of approximately 200,000 students. We together designed several evaluation metrics to assess the goodness of machine learning algorithms from an educator's perspective. This paper focuses on students at risk of not finishing high school on time, but our framework lays a strong foundation for future work on other adverse academic outcomes.","authors":["Hima Lakkaraju","Everaldo Aguiar","Carl Shan","David Miller"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1145/2783258.2788620","Conference: the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference"],"references":["271297360_Identifying_At-Risk_Students_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques_A_Case_Study_with_IS_100","268424401_Why_Students_Drop_Out_of_School_A_Review_of_25_Years_of_Research","266660233_Predicting_student_risks_through_longitudinal_analysis","262403751_Engagement_vs_performance_Using_electronic_portfolios_to_predict_first_semester_engineering_student_retention","253478618_Preventing_Student_Disengagement_and_Keeping_Students_on_the_Graduation_Path_in_Urban_Middle-Grades_Schools_Early_Identification_and_Effective_Interventions","228965727_Evaluating_probability_estimates_from_decision_trees","228333631_Obtaining_Calibrated_Probabilities_from_Boosting","221665812_Data_Mining_Applications_A_comparative_Study_for_Predicting_Student'sperformance","220466684_Learning_to_rank_for_information_retrieval_LR4IR_2009","216790801_Consequences_in_Health_Status_and_Costs_In_Levin_H_and_Belfield_C_eds_The_Price_We_Pay_Economic_and_Social_Consequences_of_Inadequate_Education","312449512_Mining_Frequent_Patterns_without_Candidate_Generation","308751225_Engagement_vs_Performance_Using_Electronic_Portfolios_to_Predict_First_Semester_Engineering_Student_Persistence","307175251_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","300852882_Who_when_and_why","288906520_Random_forests","284529345_Rank_Correlation_Methods","284529285_Rank_Correlation_Methods","277405361_Who_When_and_Why_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Prioritizing_Students_at_Risk_of_not_Graduating_High_School_on_Time","271754129_Predicting_High_School_Graduation_and_College_Enrollment_Comparing_Early_Warning_Indicator_Data_and_Teacher_Intuition","260103484_Do_We_Know_Who_Will_Drop_Out_A_Review_of_the_Predictors_of_Dropping_out_of_High_School_Precision_Sensitivity_and_Specificity","258304769_Machine_Learning_Volume_45_Number_1_-_SpringerLink","239795378_Why_Tenth_Graders_Fail_to_Finish_High_School_A_Dropout_Typology_Latent_Class_Analysis","239667393_Yiwen_Yin_Mining_Frequent_Patterns_without_Candidate_Generation","228654443_Predicting_students_drop_out_A_case_study","227893179_School_Dropout_as_Predicted_by_Peer_Rejection_and_Antisocial_Behavior","227716471_Machine_Learning_that_Matters","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","225555946_A_note_on_Platt's_probabilistic_outputs_for_support_vector_machines","221299328_Learning_to_Rank_for_Information_Retrieval","221214987_Mining_Frequent_Patterns_Without_Candidate_Generation","220613774_Learning_to_Rank_for_Information_Retrieval","220479775_Introduction_to_special_issue_on_learning_to_rank_for_information_retrieval","216900305_Rank_Correlation_Method"]}
