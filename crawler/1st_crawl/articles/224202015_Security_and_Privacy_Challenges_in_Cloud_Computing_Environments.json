{"id":"224202015_Security_and_Privacy_Challenges_in_Cloud_Computing_Environments","abstract":"The cloud computing paradigm is still evolving, but has recently gained tremendous momentum. However, security and privacy issues pose as the key roadblock to its fast adoption. In this article, the authors present security and privacy challenges that are exacerbated by the unique aspects of clouds and show how they're related to various delivery and deployment models. They discuss various approaches to address these challenges, existing solutions, and future work needed to provide a trustworthy cloud computing environment.","authors":["Daniel Takabi","James B. D.
