{"id":"344428956_Augmented_Reality_and_Virtual_Reality_A_360_Immersion_into_Western_History_of_Architecture","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to describe the importance of\nusing new technology-based tools in the form of augmented\nreality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) as an adequate solution to\nhelp meet students' educational needs, and help in their\nprofessional development. Both tools, put together, play an\nimportant role in the History of Architecture teaching\nprocess, providing an entertaining and engaging way of\nacquiring information and building critical thinking skills.\nHistory curricula and all core architecture courses are\nprepared for students’ performance attainment balancing\nbetween theoretical and professional training. However,\nstudents’ performance, their learning and interest in the\ncourses may be affected by the teaching method. This paper\ncontributes by presenting different approaches for using AR\nand VR tools and concludes about the potential of their use in:\n1) improving significantly the learning experience in the\nWestern History course, and 2) positively changing the mental\nimage the students previously had about the course.","authors":["D.
