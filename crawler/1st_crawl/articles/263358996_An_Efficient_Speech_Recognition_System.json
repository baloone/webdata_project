{"id":"263358996_An_Efficient_Speech_Recognition_System","abstract":"This paper describes the development of an efficient speech recognition system using different techniques such as MFCC, VQ and HMM. This paper explains how speaker recognition followed by speech recognition is used to recognize the speech faster, efficiently and accurately. MFCC is used to extract the characteristics from the input speech signal with respect to a particular word uttered by a particular speaker. Then HMM is used on Quantized feature vectors to identify the word by evaluating the maximum log likelihood values for the spoken word","authors":["Suma Swamy","Kollengode Ramakrishnan"],"meta":["August 2013Computer Science & Engineering An International Journal 3(4)","DOI:10.5121/cseij.2013.3403"],"references":["45907470_Voice_Recognition_Algorithms_using_Mel_Frequency_Cepstral_Coefficient_MFCC_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping_DTW_Techniques","238732205_Voice_Command_Recognition_System_Based_on_MFCC_and_VQ_Algorithms","237708212_Vector_Quantization_In_Text_Dependent_Automatic_Speaker_Recognition_Using_Mel-frequency_Cepstrum_Coefficient","235607054_An_Improved_Speech_Recognition_System","235166512_Isolated_Word_Recognition_From_In-Ear_Microphone_Data_Using_Hidden_Markov_Models_HMM","229068216_Readings_in_human-computer_interaction_towards_year_2000","224171567_Arabic_speech_recognition_using_Hidden_Markov_Model_ToolkitHTK","3342595_Filtering_on_hidden_Markov_models","2984124_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_on_Speech_Recognition"]}
