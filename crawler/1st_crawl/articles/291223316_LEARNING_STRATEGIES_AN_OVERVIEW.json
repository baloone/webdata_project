{"id":"291223316_LEARNING_STRATEGIES_AN_OVERVIEW","abstract":"Learning strategies can be defined as the behaviors of a learner that are intended to influence how the learner processes information. Examples include underlining of key ideas in a passage, outlining of the ideas in a lecture, or trying to put some newly learned information into one's own words. This chapter presents a conceptual overview of learning strategies, with special focus on cognitive issues. It presents three basic models of learning and four components in the models—instruction, learning processes, learning outcomes, and performance. The chapter describes how learning strategy training can affect the process and outcome of learning, with special emphasis on an exemplary research study. Because learning strategies are intended to influence the process of learning, any useful theory of learning strategies must be based on an underlying theory of human learning. The chapter discusses three major types of theories of learning—quantitative, qualitative, and behaviorist.","authors":["Richard E.
