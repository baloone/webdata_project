{"id":"334776543_Direct_calculation_of_computer-generated_holograms_in_sparse_bases","abstract":"Computer-generated holography is computationally intensive, making it especially challenging for holographic displays where high-resolutions and video rates are needed. To this end, we propose a technique for directly calculating short-time Fourier transform coefficients without the need for a look-up table. Because point spread functions are sparse in this transform domain, only a small fraction of the coefficients need to be updated, enabling significant speed gains. Twenty-fold accelerations are reported over the reference implementation. This approach generalizes the notion of the phase-added stereogram, allowing for the calculatiion of an arbitrary number of Fourier coefficients per block, enabling high calculation speed with holograms of good visual quality, targeting minimal memory requirements.","authors":["David Blinder"],"meta":["August 2019Optics Express 27(16):23124","DOI:10.1364/OE.27.023124","Project: INTERFERE"],"references":["328083273_Signal_processing_challenges_for_digital_holographic_video_display_systems","328029631_Real-time_layer-based_computer-generated_hologram_calculation_for_the_Fourier_transform_optical_system","324429923_Colour_computer-generated_holography_for_point_clouds_utilizing_the_Phong_illumination_model","322459256_Accelerated_computer_generated_holography_using_sparse_bases_in_the_STFT_domain","310837859_Recent_progress_in_computer-generated_holography_for_three-dimensional_scenes","329721671_Large-scale_electroholography_by_HORN-8_from_a_point-cloud_model_with_400000_points","313890235_Rendering_of_specular_curved_objects_in_polygon-based_computer_holography","313856940_An_accelerated_hologram_calculation_using_the_wavefront_recording_plane_method_and_wavelet_transform","312265061_Fast_generation_of_computer-generated_holograms_using_wavelet_shrinkage","312048310_Fast_computer_generated_hologram_calculation_with_a_mini_look-up_table_incorporated_with_radial_symmetric_interpolation"]}
