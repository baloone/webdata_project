{"id":"301913147_Identification_of_plant_species_using_non-imaging_hyperspectral_data","abstract":"Hyperspectral non-imaging data provides the spectral range from 400â€“2500nm which has the ability to identify each and every unique materials on the surface. The plant species identification is critical task manually and computationally. In the present paper, we have proposed plant species identification system based on non-imaging hyperspectral data and designed our own database for experiment. Also we have identified various plant species and performed support vector machine (SVM) algorithm on it for recognition. The overall accuracy 91% was achieved through SVM.","authors":["Amarsinh Varpe","Yogesh Rajendra","Amol Vibhute","Sandeep Vasant Gaikwad"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1109/MAMI.2015.7456613","Conference: 2015 International Conference on Man and Machine Interfacing (MAMI)"],"references":["269039896_Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_of_Urban_Areas_An_Overview_of_Techniques_and_Applications","228882904_Spectroradiometer_data_structuring_pre-processing_and_analysis_-_An_IT_based_approach","276241047_Plant_Species_Identification_Based_on_Independent_Component_Analysis_for_Hyperspectral_Data","270663694_Fast_and_robust_fixed-point_algorithms_for_independent_component_analysis","260623075_Generalized_Composite_Kernel_Framework_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","258789256_Learn_Multiple-Kernel_SVMs_for_Domain_Adaptation_in_Hyperspectral_Data","257018659_Spectral_difference_analysis_and_airborne_imaging_classification_for_citrus_greening_infected_trees","256822743_Label_propagation_based_supervised_locality_projection_analysis_for_plant_leaf_classification","242269086_Plant_species_discrimination_using_spectralspatial_descrip-_tive_statistics","224199205_A_multiple_classifier_approach_for_spectral-spatial_classification_of_hyperspectral_data","223197164_Plant_species_identification_using_Elliptic_Fourier_leaf_shape_analysis","224174209_Multiple_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_Approach_for_Hyperspectral_Data","220492175_Multi-and_Hyperspectral_geologic_remote_sensing_A_review","220405729_EMD_Based_on_Independent_Component_Analysis_and_Its_Application_in_Machinery_Fault_Diagnosis","220405537_An_improving_MFCC_features_extraction_based_on_FastICA_algorithm_plus_RASTA_filtering"]}
