{"id":"279864619_A_new_Universal_Resample_Stable_Bootstrap-based_Stopping_Criterion_in_PLS_Components_Construction","abstract":"We develop a new robust stopping criterion in Partial Least Squares\nRegressions (PLSR) components construction characterised by a high level of\nstability. This new criterion is defined as a universal one since it is\nsuitable both for PLSR and its extension to Generalized Linear Regressions\n(PLSGLR). This criterion is based on a non-parametric bootstrap process and has\nto be computed algorithmically. It allows to test each successive components on\na preset significant level alpha. In order to assess its performances and\nrobustness with respect to different noise levels, we perform intensive\ndatasets simulations, with a preset and known number of components to extract,\nboth in the case n>p (n being the number of subjects and p the number of\noriginal predictors), and for datasets with n<p. We then use t-tests to compare\nthe performance of our approach to some others classical criteria. The property\nof robustness is particularly tested through resampling processes on a real\nallelotyping dataset. Our conclusion is that our criterion presents also better\nglobal predictive performances, both in the PLSR and PLSGLR (Logistic and\nPoisson) frameworks.","authors":["Jérémy Magnanensi","Frédéric Bertrand","Maumy Myriam","Nicolas Meyer"],"meta":["May 2017Statistics and Computing 27(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11222-016-9651-4","SourcearXiv","Project: High dimensional inference"],"references":["343212409_Choosing_the_number_of_factors_in_partial_least_squares_regression_estimating_and_minimizing_the_mean_squared_error-_of_prediction","313669983_Selection_of_optimal_regression_models_via_crossvalidation","313199586_PLS_regression_methods","303538686_The_generalization_of_Student's_problem_when_several_different_population_variances_are_involved","280746118_Choosing_the_number_of_factors_in_partial_least_squares_regression_Estimating_and_minimizing_the_mean_squared_error_of_prediction","278861485_Comparing_the_predictive_accuracy_of_models_using_a_simple_randomization_test","273134799_Estimating_the_Dimension_of_a_Model","272467538_Cross-Validation_in_Principal_Component_Analysis","271196714_New_Look_at_Statistical-Model_Identification","268835946_Bootstrapping_regression_models_with_many_parameters"]}
