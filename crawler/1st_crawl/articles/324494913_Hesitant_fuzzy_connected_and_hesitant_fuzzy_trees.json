{"id":"324494913_Hesitant_fuzzy_connected_and_hesitant_fuzzy_trees","abstract":"The most appreciate theory to deal with uncertainties is the theory of Fuzzy sets. Recently, a new extension of fuzzy sets so-called Hesitant Fuzzy sets has been introduced to deal with hesitant situations. And the connectivity has an important role in neural networks, computer network, and clustering. We introduce the notions of Hesitant fuzzy path, Hesitant Fuzzy connected,Hesitant Fuzzy cycles and Hesitant Fuzzy Tree in this paper.","authors":["R. Rajeswari","M.G. Rani","K.H.
