{"id":"317158840_A_Java_application_programming_interface_for_in-vehicle_infotainment_devices","abstract":"Traveling long distances by vehicle in the modern world has become bearable with the availability of In-Vehicle Infotainment systems to entertain and inform both drivers and other occupants. One of the problems faced by application developers for In-Vehicle Infotainment systems is the lack of an open and standard platform across different vehicle manufacturers. The Application Programming Interface and the concepts proposed in this paper should reduce the closed, proprietary and non-extensible systems being released today and bolster the design and development of open, more complete, feature-full systems in vehicles that will not only assist but also entertain drivers and passengers.","authors":["Branimir Kovacevic","M.
