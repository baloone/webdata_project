{"id":"321374792_Representation_Learning_for_Scale-free_Networks","abstract":"Network embedding aims to learn the low-dimensional representations of vertexes in a network, while structure and inherent properties of the network is preserved. Existing network embedding works primarily focus on preserving the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximity of vertexes, while the macroscopic scale-free property is largely ignored. Scale-free property depicts the fact that vertex degrees follow a heavy-tailed distribution (i.e., only a few vertexes have high degrees) and is a critical property of real-world networks, such as social networks. In this paper, we study the problem of learning representations for scale-free networks. We first theoretically analyze the difficulty of embedding and reconstructing a scale-free network in the Euclidean space, by converting our problem to the sphere packing problem. Then, we propose the \"degree penalty\" principle for designing scale-free property preserving network embedding algorithm: punishing the proximity between high-degree vertexes. We introduce two implementations of our principle by utilizing the spectral techniques and a skip-gram model respectively. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that our algorithms are able to not only reconstruct heavy-tailed distributed degree distribution, but also outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various network mining tasks, such as vertex classification and link prediction.","authors":["Rui Feng","Yang Yang","Wenjie Hu","Fei Wu"],"meta":["November 2017"],"references":["318916856_metapath2vec_Scalable_Representation_Learning_for_Heterogeneous_Networks","311762129_Powerlaw_A_python_package_for_analysis_of_heavy-tailed_distributions","305624423_Efficient_embedding_of_complex_networks_to_hyperbolic_space_via_their_Laplacian","305997704_node2vec_Scalable_Feature_Learning_for_Networks","285599320_Laplacian_Eigenmaps_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Data_Representation","285380039_Bounds_for_Packings_on_a_Sphere_and_in_Space","283598027_Learning_to_discover_social_circles_in_ego_networks","261588607_The_Proof_and_Measurement_of_Association_Between_Two_Things","261136952_DeepWalk_Online_Learning_of_Social_Representations","242512892_A_New_Measure_of_Rank_Correlation"]}
