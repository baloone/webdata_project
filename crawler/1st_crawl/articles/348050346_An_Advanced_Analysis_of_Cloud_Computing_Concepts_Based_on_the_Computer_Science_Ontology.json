{"id":"348050346_An_Advanced_Analysis_of_Cloud_Computing_Concepts_Based_on_the_Computer_Science_Ontology","abstract":"Our primary research hypothesis stands on a simple idea: The evolution of top-rated publications on a particular theme depends heavily on the progress and maturity of related topics. And this even when there are no clear relations or some concepts appear to cease to exist and leave place for newer ones starting many years ago. We implemented our model based on Computer Science Ontol-ogy (CSO) and analyzed 44 years of publications. Then we derived the most important concepts related to Cloud Computing (CC) from the scientific collection offered by Clarivate Analytics. Our methodology includes data extraction using advanced web crawling techniques, data preparation, statistical data analysis , and graphical representations. We obtained related concepts after aggregating the scores using the Jaccard coefficient and CSO Ontology. Our article reveals the contribution of Cloud Computing topics in research papers in leading scientific journals and the relationships between the field of Cloud Computing and the interdependent subdivisions identified in the broader framework of Computer Science.","authors":["Pawe≈Ç Lula","Octavian Dospinescu","Daniel Homocianu","Napoleon-Alexandru Sireteanu"],"meta":["December 2020Computers, Materials and Continua 66(3):2425-2443","DOI:10.32604/cmc.2021.013771"],"references":["330890037_Electronic_Word-of-Mouth_for_Online_Retailers_Predictors_of_Volume_and_Valence","330013697_Towards_evaluation_of_cloud_ontologies","331443619_Cloud-assisted_gamification_for_education_and_learning_-_Recent_advances_and_challenges","330747150_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Cloud_Computing_Use_in_Supply_Chain_Integration","330111231_Trusted_Cloud_Computing_Architectures_for_Infrastructure_as_a_Service_Survey_and_Systematic_Literature_Review","329341629_Understanding_the_effect_of_cloud_computing_on_organizational_agility_An_empirical_examination","328734311_Internet_of_Things_IoT_mobile_cloud_cloudlet_mobile_IoT_IoT_cloud_fog_mobile_edge_and_edge_emerging_computing_paradigms_Disambiguation_and_research_directions","328632266_GiPlot_An_interactive_cloud-based_tool_for_visualizing_and_interpreting_large_spectral_data_sets","328086523_Examining_the_role_of_the_AIS_research_literature_using_the_natural_experiment_of_the_2018_JIS_conference_on_cloud_computing","327992751_Recent_security_challenges_in_cloud_computing"]}
