{"id":"319193772_Cell-centered_Lagrangian_Lax-Wendroff_HLL_hybrid_method_for_elasto-plastic_flows","abstract":"The Wilkins hypoelastic model of the solid dynamics is numerically treated by the cell-centered Lagrangian Laxâ€“Wendroff HLL hybrid scheme proposed recently for the Lagrangian hydrodynamics. The scheme is applied to the mass, momentum and energy conservation laws, while the elastic part of the incremental constitutive law is treated by the numerical method introduced by Maire et. al. [P.H. Maire et. al., J, Comput. Phys. 235:626,(2013)] and the plastic part by the Wilkins radial return. The performance of the numerical scheme is demonstrated on several test cases.","authors":["David Fridrich","Richard Liska","Burton Wendroff"],"meta":["August 2017Computers & Fluids 157","DOI:10.1016/j.compfluid.2017.08.030"],"references":["284065142_Consistent_hypo-elastic_behavior_using_the_four-dimensional_formalism_of_differential_geometry","283133059_A_high-order_cell-centered_Lagrangian_scheme_for_one-dimensional_elastic-plastic_problems","280880204_Reduction_of_dissipation_in_Lagrange_cell-centered_hydrodynamics_CCH_through_corner_gradient_reconstruction_CGR","264216447_A_finite_volume_cell-centered_Lagrangian_hydrodynamics_approach_for_solids_in_general_unstructured_grids","261253990_A_hyperbolic_model_for_viscous_Newtonian_flows","308272089_Some_Cell-centered_Lagrangian_Lax-Wendroff_HLL_Hybrid_Schemes","305136706_Incremental_constitutive_models_for_elastoplastic_materials_undergoing_finite_deformations_by_using_a_four-dimensional_formalism","301872746_On_direct_Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian_ADER-WENO_finite_volume_schemes_for_the_HPR_model_of_nonlinear_hyperelasticity","281102261_An_upwind_vertex_centred_Finite_Volume_solver_for_Lagrangian_solid_dynamics","267008735_Fundamental_methods_in_hydrodynamics","260971250_High_order_curvilinear_finite_elements_for_elastic-plastic_Lagrangian_dynamics","259633620_Analysis_of_oblique_shock_waves_in_solids_using_shock_polars","238949473_Modelling_wave_dynamics_of_compressible_elastic_materials","237026921_A_cell-centered_Lagrangian_finite_volume_approach_for_computing_elasto-plastic_response_of_solids_in_cylindrical_axisymmetric_geometries","236997068_A_cell-centered_Lagrangian_Godunov-like_method_for_solid_dynamics","236646908_A_nominally_second-order_cell-centered_Lagrangian_scheme_for_simulating_elastic-plastic_flows_on_two-dimensional_unstructured_grids","234183158_Errors_for_calculations_of_strong_shocks_using_an_artificial_viscosity_and_an_artificial_heat_flux","227776700_A_higher-order_Godunov_method_for_modeling_finite_deformation_in_elastic-plastic_solids","222825552_A_subcell_remapping_method_on_staggered_polygonal_grids_for_Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian_methods","222545543_A_Free-Lagrange_Augmented_Godunov_Method_for_the_Simulation_of_Elastic-Plastic_Solids","222524160_A_High-Order_Eulerian_Godunov_Method_for_Elastic-Plastic_Flow_in_Solids","222406064_A_high-order_cell-centered_Lagrangian_scheme_for_two-dimensional_compressible_fluid_flows_on_unstructured_meshes","220206953_Discretization_of_hyperelasticity_on_unstructured_mesh_with_a_cell-centered_Lagrangian_scheme","24382978_On_Upstream_Differencing_and_Godunov-Type_Schemes_for_Hyperbolic_Conservation_Laws"]}
