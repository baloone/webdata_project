{"id":"262284865_Web_30_-_Based_personalisation_of_learning_objects_in_virtual_learning_environments","abstract":"The paper aims at research on Web 3.0 - based personalisation of learning objects (LOs) while learning in virtual learning environments. Learning personalisation is analysed in terms of suitability of LOs and VLEs to particular learning styles. The novel sets portrait analysing interconnections between students' learning styles, their preferred learning activities, relevant teaching/learning methods, and LOs types is presented in more detail. The well-known standardised vocabularies of teaching/learning methods and LOs types were used to establish these interconnections. The sets portrait of these interconnections is followed by the appropriate ontology. The ontology is considered as an appropriate tool to create learners' personalised learning environments consisting of LOs, suitable teaching/learning methods and activities according to their preferred learning styles. The ontology should help the learner to find suitable LOs according to preferred learning methods/activities, and vice versa, and thus to personalise learning. The presented Web 3.0 - based approaches are the typical cases of information and communication technologies (ICT's) application for development of human capital.","authors":["Eugenijus Kurilovas","Svetlana Kubilinskiene","Valentina Dagiene"],"meta":["January 2014Computers in Human Behavior 30:654-662","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2013.07.039"],"references":["285663126_Towards_a_Personalised_Learning_Style_Based_Collaborative_Blended_Learning_Model_with_Individual_Assessment","285011173_A_Stochastic_Approach_for_Automatic_and_Dynamic_Modeling_of_Students'_Learning_Styles_in_Adaptive_Educational_Systems","284540085_Intelligence_Reframed_Multiple_Intelligences_for_the_21st_Century","275963626_Adaptive_Educational_Software_by_Applying_Reinforcement_Learning","319393976_The_Educational_Semantic_Web","313241423_Connecting_learning_objects_to_instructional_design_theory_A_definition_a_metaphor_and_a_taxonomy","289245800_Approach_to_Dynamic_Assembling_of_Individualized_Learning_Paths","285679285_A_recommender_engine_for_advanced_personalized_feedback_in_e-learning_environments","285676214_Development_of_an_Intelligent_Instruction_System_for_Mathematical_Computation","279541369_The_relationship_between_incentives_explicit_and_tacit_knowledge_contribution_in_online_engineering_education_project"]}
