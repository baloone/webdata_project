{"id":"328620106_Interactive_Computer_Science_Learning_in_Primary_School","abstract":"In recent years, the tendency to introduce computer science and programming into pupils' learning has been on the rise in primary school. Until recently, this training took place in elective training classes - clubs of interest, etc. The new Law on Pre-school and School Education in Bulgaria determines the study of computer programming elements in the elementary school level in the subject \"Computer Modeling\" in the obligatory preparation of the students. The characteristics of the students at this age determine the need to use a variety of interactive methods such as game-based learning, use of robotic devices, interactive whiteboard, etc. The report will share the authors' experience in applying such interactive technologies to the learning process, and will comment on the opportunities they provide to achieve the different educational vand development goals.","authors":["Todorka Glushkova","Veneta Tabakova-Komsalova","Irina Krasteva"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.26883/2010.181.849","Project: ФП17-ФМИ-008"],"references":["320207260_COMPUTER_MODELING_TRAINING_IN_PRIMARY_SCHOOL_-_RESULTS_CONCLUSIONS_AND_ASSESSMENTS","320206286_APPLICATION_OF_ROBOTICS_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_EDUCATION","271762983_Application_of_game-based_learning_in_secondary_school"]}
