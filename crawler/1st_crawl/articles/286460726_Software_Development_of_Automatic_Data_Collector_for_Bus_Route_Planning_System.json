{"id":"286460726_Software_Development_of_Automatic_Data_Collector_for_Bus_Route_Planning_System","abstract":"Public transportation is important issue in Taiwan. Recently, mobile application named Bus Route Planning was developed to help the user to get information about public transportation using bus. But, this application often gave the user inaccurate bus information and this application has less attractive GUI. To overcome those 2 problems, it needed 2 kinds of solutions. First, a more accurate time prediction algorithm is needed to predict the arrival time of bus. Second, augmented reality technology can be used to make a GUI improvement. In this research, Automatic Data Collector system was proposed to give support for those 2 solutions at once. This proposed system has 3 main functionalities. First, data collector function to provide some data sets that can be further analyzed as an base of time prediction algorithm. Second, data updater functions to provide the most updated bus information for used in augmented reality system. Third, data management function to gave the system better functionality to supported those 2 related systems. This proposed Automatic Data Collector system was developed using batch data processing scenario and SQL native query in Java programming language. The result of testing shown this data processing scenario was very effective to made database manipulation especially for large-sized data.
