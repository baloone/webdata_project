{"id":"259367487_Large-Scale_Multi-label_Text_Classification_-_Revisiting_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Large-scale datasets with multi-labels are becoming readily available, and\nthe demand for large-scale multi-label classification algorithm is also\nincreasing. In this work, we propose to utilize a single-layer Neural Networks\napproach in large-scale multi-label text classification tasks with recently\nproposed learning techniques. We carried out experiments on six textual\ndatasets with varying characteristics and size, and show that a simple Neural\nNetworks model equipped with recent advanced techniques for Neural Networks\ncomponents such as activation layer, optimization, and generalization\nalgorithms performs as well as or even outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches on large-scale datasets with diverse\ncharacteristics.","authors":["Jinseok Nam","Jungi Kim","Iryna Gurevych","Johannes FÃ¼rnkranz"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44851-9_28","SourcearXiv","Conference: Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases"],"references":["273859036_Multi-Label_Classification_An_Overview","319770387_Deep_Sparse_Rectifier_Neural_Networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","313418906_Bayes_optimal_multilabel_classification_via_probabilistic_classifier_chains","308161218_Introduction_to_information_retrieval_chapt","285278428_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features","281328550_On_the_Non-existence_of_Convex_Calibrated_Surrogate_Losses_for_Ranking","276935841_Introduction_to_Information_Retrieval","270878508_Parsing_with_Compositional_Vector_Grammars","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","239033363_Accelerated_learning_in_layered_neural_networks","261159435_On_rectified_linear_units_for_speech_processing","260637318_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition_The_Shared_Views_of_Four_Research_Groups","257618355_Multilabel_classification_with_meta-level_features_in_a_learning-to-rank_framework","243134514_BoosTexter_A_Boosting-based_System_for_Text_Categorization"]}
