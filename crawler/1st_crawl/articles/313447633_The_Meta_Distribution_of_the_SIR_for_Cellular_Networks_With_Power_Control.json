{"id":"313447633_The_Meta_Distribution_of_the_SIR_for_Cellular_Networks_With_Power_Control","abstract":"The meta distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) provides fine-grained information about the performance of individual links in a wireless network. This paper focuses on the analysis of the meta distribution of the SIR for both the cellular network uplink and downlink with fractional power control. For the uplink scenario, an approximation of the interfering user point process with a non-homogeneous Poisson point process is used. The moments of the meta distribution for both scenarios are calculated. Some bounds, the analytical expression, the mean local delay, and the beta approximation of the meta distribution are provided. The results give interesting insights into the effect of the power control in both the uplink and downlink. Detailed simulations show that the approximations made in the analysis are well justified.","authors":["Yuanjie Wang","Martin Haenggi","Zhenhui Tan"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE Transactions on Communications PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780218","Project: Meta Distributions"],"references":["318810638_Spatial_outage_capacity_of_poisson_bipolar_networks","301876400_A_Primer_on_Cellular_Network_Analysis_Using_Stochastic_Geometry","318374457_A_Fine-Grained_Analysis_of_Millimeter-Wave_Device-to-Device_Networks","316034653_Analysis_of_D2D_Underlaid_Cellular_Networks_SIR_Meta_Distribution_and_Mean_Local_Delay","310953440_User_Point_Processes_in_Cellular_Networks","308913177_Downlink_Coordinated_Joint_Transmission_for_Mutual_Information_Accumulation","305389020_Ergodic_Spectral_Efficiency_in_MIMO_Cellular_Networks","305313418_Analyzing_Uplink_SINR_and_Rate_in_Massive_MIMO_Systems_Using_Stochastic_Geometry","278798683_A_New_Phase_Transitions_for_Local_Delays_in_MANETs","278332526_Stochastic_Geometry_Modeling_of_Cellular_Networks_Analysis_Simulation_and_Experimental_Validation"]}
