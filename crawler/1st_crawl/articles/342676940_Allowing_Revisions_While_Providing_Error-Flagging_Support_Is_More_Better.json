{"id":"342676940_Allowing_Revisions_While_Providing_Error-Flagging_Support_Is_More_Better","abstract":"In this study, we studied whether the number of revisions allowed per problem when error-flagging feedback is provided has a significant effect on learning. We used a partial cross-over study and analyzed the data collected by two adaptive tutors on while loops and for loops over six semesters. We found that when students were unfamiliar with the concepts, they solved fewer problems and therefore, learned significantly less when they were provided more opportunities for revision with error-flagging feedback. But, once they became more familiar with the concepts, allowing for more revisions had no deleterious effect on learning.","authors":["Amruth Kumar"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-52240-7_27","In book: Artificial Intelligence in Education (pp.147-151)"],"references":["283695030_A_Model_for_Deploying_Software_Tutors","261848403_Limiting_the_Number_of_Revisions_while_Providing_Error-Flagging_Support_during_Tests","237736373_Explanation_of_step-by-step_execution_as_feedback_for_problems_on_program_analysis_and_its_generation_in_model-based_problem-solving_tutors","225256918_A_Scalable_Solution_for_Adaptive_Problem_Sequencing_and_Its_Evaluation","221413959_Error-Flagging_Support_for_Testing_and_Its_Effect_on_Adaptation","221297327_Error-Flagging_Support_and_Higher_Test_Scores","223094982_The_worked-example_effect_Not_an_artefact_of_lousy_control_conditions"]}
