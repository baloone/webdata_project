{"id":"272752290_Time-Approximation_Trade-offs_for_Inapproximable_Problems","abstract":"In this paper we focus on problems which do not admit a constant-factor\napproximation in polynomial time and explore how quickly their approximability\nimproves as the allowed running time is gradually increased from polynomial to\n(sub-)exponential.\nWe tackle a number of problems: For Min Independent Dominating Set, Max\nInduced Path, Forest and Tree, for any $r(n)$, a simple, known scheme gives an\napproximation ratio of $r$ in time roughly $r^{n/r}$. We show that, for most\nvalues of $r$, if this running time could be significantly improved the ETH\nwould fail. For Max Minimal Vertex Cover we give a non-trivial\n$\\sqrt{r}$-approximation in time $2^{n/r}$. We match this with a similarly\ntight result. We also give a $\\log r$-approximation for Min ATSP in time\n$2^{n/r}$ and an $r$-approximation for Max Grundy Coloring in time $r^{n/r}$.\nFurthermore, we show that Min Set Cover exhibits a curious behavior in this\nsuper-polynomial setting: for any $\\delta > 0$ it admits an\n$m^\\delta$-approximation, where $m$ is the number of sets, in just\nquasi-polynomial time. We observe that if such ratios could be achieved in\npolynomial time, the ETH or the Projection Games Conjecture would fail.","authors":["Ã‰douard Bonnet","Michael Lampis","Vangelis Paschos"],"meta":["February 2015Journal of Computer and System Sciences 92","DOI:10.1016/j.jcss.2017.09.009","SourcearXiv"],"references":["255731515_Independent_Set_Induced_Matching_and_Pricing_Connections_and_Tight_Subexponential_Time_Approximation_Hardnesses","299317382_Effective-Resistance-Reducing_Flows_Spectrally_Thin_Trees_and_Asymmetric_TSP","255965613_Fixed-Parameter_and_Approximation_Algorithms_A_New_Look","237091989_New_Inapproximability_Bounds_for_TSP","236661612_Analytical_Approach_to_Parallel_Repetition","227656765_On_the_worst-case_performance_of_some_algorithms_for_the_asymmetric_traveling_salesman_problem","226547527_Fast_Algorithms_for_min_independent_dominating_set","225599997_Exact_and_Approximate_Bandwidth","223117539_Approximating_the_minimum_maximal_independence_number","222686213_Exponential-time_approximation_of_weighted_set_cover"]}
