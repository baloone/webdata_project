{"id":"315807103_Greed_is_Good_Near-Optimal_Submodular_Maximization_via_Greedy_Optimization","abstract":"It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \\varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.","authors":["Moran Feldman","Christopher Harshaw","Amin Karbasi"],"meta":["April 2017"],"references":["266262048_Lazier_Than_Lazy_Greedy","309854527_Constrained_Submodular_Maximization_via_a_Non-symmetric_Technique","306186951_Constrained_Submodular_Maximization_Beyond_1e","301405062_Submodularity_for_Data_Selection_in_Machine_Translation","288242526_Near-optimal_MAP_inference_for_determinantal_point_processes","285833853_Fast_algorithms_for_maximizing_submodular_functions","284504706_Submodular_Maximization_with_Cardinality_Constraints","280912053_Deterministic_Algorithms_for_Submodular_Maximization_Problems","266748154_Matrix_Completion_and_Low-Rank_SVD_via_Fast_Alternating_Least_Squares","266477774_Comparing_Apples_and_Oranges_Query_Tradeoff_in_Submodular_Maximization"]}
