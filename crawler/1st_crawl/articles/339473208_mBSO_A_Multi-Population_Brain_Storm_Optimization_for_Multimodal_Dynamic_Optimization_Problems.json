{"id":"339473208_mBSO_A_Multi-Population_Brain_Storm_Optimization_for_Multimodal_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems","abstract":"Brain Storm Optimization (BSO), which is an effective swarm intelligence method inspired by the human brain-storming process, has shown promising results in solving static optimization problems. However, The search spaces of many real-world problems change over time, in which the original BSO and its variants are not able to cope with. This paper extends BSO as an adaptive multi-population based algorithm, i.e., mBSO, to solve dynamic optimization problems (DOPs). Firstly, a modified BSO, which uses new update mechanisms independent from the maximum number of iterations and objective space grouping method, is proposed. Then, the modified BSO is embedded in a multi-population framework. Several mechanisms such as convergence detection, exclusion, and re-diversification are employed to address the challenging issues of DOPs. The moving peaks benchmark (MPB) is used to evaluate the performance of mBSO along with comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. The outcome indicates the efficiency of the proposed mBSO in locating optima and tracking them after environmental changes.","authors":["Farhad Pourpanah","Ran Wang","Xizhao Wang","Yuhui Shi"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.1109/SSCI44817.2019.9002850","Conference: 2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)At: Xiamen, China"],"references":["331528458_Scaling_Up_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems_A_Divide-and-Conquer_Approach","330250614_Brain_Storm_Optimization_Graph_Theory_BSOGT_and_Energy_Resource_Aware_Virtual_Network_Mapping_ERVNM_for_Medical_Image_System_in_Cloud","326906844_Changing_or_keeping_solutions_in_dynamic_optimization_problems_with_switching_costs","325562153_Robust_Optimization_Over_Time_by_Learning_Problem_Space_Characteristics","315638766_A_New_Multi-swarm_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_Robust_Optimization_Over_Time","312027904_A_survey_of_swarm_intelligence_for_dynamic_optimization_Algorithms_and_applications","280555578_CEC_2016_Special_Session_on_Brain_Storm_Optimization_Algorithms","265160522_Continuous_dynamic_optimisation_using_evolutionary_algorithms","263058566_Speciation_based_firefly_algorithm_for_optimization_in_dynamic_environments","262495155_Evolutionary_Dynamic_Optimization_A_Survey_of_the_State_of_the_art","262400968_Brain_Storm_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Multi-objective_Optimization_Problems","257512309_A_comprehensive_survey_Artificial_bee_colony_ABC_algorithm_and_applications","235248605_A_Novel_Hybrid_Algorithm_for_Optimization_in_Multimodal_Dynamic_Environments","226962021_Particle_Swarms_for_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems","224169929_A_Clustering_Particle_Swarm_Optimizer_for_Locating_and_Tracking_Multiple_Optima_in_Dynamic_Environments","4307845_Using_regression_to_improve_local_convergence","332967457_Feature_selection_based_on_brain_storm_optimization_for_data_classification","330371849_A_Hybrid_Model_of_Fuzzy_Min-Max_and_Brain_Storm_Optimization_for_Feature_Selection_and_Data_Classification","327533760_A_Novel_Framework_for_Improving_Multi-Population_Algorithms_for_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems_A_Scheduling_Approach","326847305_Quantum_firefly_swarms_for_multimodal_dynamic_optimization_problems","303867376_A_Novel_Approach_for_Optimization_in_Dynamic_Environments_Based_on_Modified_Artificial_Fish_Swarm_Algorithm","281281058_Multi-Bacterial_Foraging_Optimization_for_Dynamic_Environments","260622139_A_General_Framework_of_Multipopulation_Methods_With_Clustering_in_Undetectable_Dynamic_Environments","257636329_A_novel_multi-swarm_algorithm_for_optimization_in_dynamic_environments_based_on_particle_swarm_optimization","228941981_Fast_Multi-Swarm_Optimization_for_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems","220885642_Genetic_Algorithms_with_Sharing_for_Multimodalfunction_Optimization","220289447_Using_Competitive_Population_Evaluation_in_a_differential_evolution_algorithm_for_dynamic_environments","3810317_Memory_Enhanced_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Changing_Optimization_Problems","3418895_Multiswarms_exclusion_and_anti-convergence_in_dynamic_environments"]}
