{"id":"312829051_A_Tool_for_Intersecting_Context-Free_Grammars_and_Its_Applications","abstract":"This paper describes a tool for intersecting context-free grammars. Since this problem is undecidable the tool follows a refinement-based approach and implements a novel refinement which is complete for regularly separable grammars. We show its effectiveness for safety verification of recursive multi-threaded programs.","authors":["Graeme Gange","Jorge A.
