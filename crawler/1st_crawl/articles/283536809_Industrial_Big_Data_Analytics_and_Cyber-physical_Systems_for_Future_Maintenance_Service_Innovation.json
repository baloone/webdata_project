{"id":"283536809_Industrial_Big_Data_Analytics_and_Cyber-physical_Systems_for_Future_Maintenance_Service_Innovation","abstract":"With the rapid advancement of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the integration of advanced analytics into manufacturing, products and services, many industries are facing new opportunities and at the same time challenges of maintaining their competency and market needs. Such integration, which is called Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), is transforming the industry into the next level. CPS facilitates the systematic transformation of massive data into information, which makes the invisible patterns of degradations and inefficiencies visible and yields to optimal decision-making. This paper focuses on existing trends in the development of industrial big data analytics and CPS. Then it briefly discusses a systematic architecture for applying CPS in manufacturing called 5C. The 5C architecture includes necessary steps to fully integrate cyber-physical systems in the manufacturing industry. Finally, a case study for designing smart machines through the 5C CPS architecture is presented.","authors":["Jay Lee","Hossein Davari","Shanhu Yang","Behrad Bagheri"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia CIRP 38:3-7","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2015.08.026","Project: CPS and Smart Industrial Agents"],"references":["277940337_A_Unified_Framework_and_Platform_for_Designing_of_Cloud-Based_Machine_Health_Monitoring_and_Manufacturing_Systems","269709304_A_Cyber-Physical_Systems_architecture_for_Industry_40-based_manufacturing_systems","262880066_Recent_advances_and_trends_in_predictive_manufacturing_systems_in_big_data_environment","228934884_A_Survey_of_Cyber_Physical_Systems","226232395_Internet_of_Things","223946574_Implementation_of_total_productive_maintenance_A_case_study"]}
