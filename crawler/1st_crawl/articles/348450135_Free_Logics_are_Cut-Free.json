{"id":"348450135_Free_Logics_are_Cut-Free","abstract":"The paper presents a uniform proof-theoretic treatment of several kinds of free logic, including the logics of existence and definedness applied in constructive mathematics and computer science, and called here quasi-free logics. All free and quasi-free logics considered are formalised in the framework of sequent calculus, the latter for the first time. It is shown that in all cases remarkable simplifications of the starting systems are possible due to the special rule dealing with identity and existence predicate. Cut elimination is proved in a constructive way for sequent calculi adequate for all logics under consideration.","authors":["Andrzej Indrzejczak"],"meta":["January 2021Studia Logica 109(1):1-28","DOI:10.1007/s11225-020-09929-8"],"references":["343698193_A_More_Unified_Approach_to_Free_Logics","335959560_Full_Cut_Elimination_and_Interpolation_for_Intuitionistic_Logic_with_Existence_Predicate","333164749_Rule-Generation_Theorem_and_its_Applications","335148187_CUT_ELIMINATION_IN_HYPERSEQUENT_CALCULUS_FOR_SOME_LOGICS_OF_LINEAR_TIME","321525659_First-Order_Modal_Logic","319393762_Foundations_of_Constructive_Mathematics","302525885_More_Free_Logic","290706642_Hypersequent_Calculi_for_Modal_Logics_Extending_S4","268902432_On_the_rules_of_suppositions_in_formal_logic","267132292_Logic_bivalence_and_denotation_2_ed"]}
