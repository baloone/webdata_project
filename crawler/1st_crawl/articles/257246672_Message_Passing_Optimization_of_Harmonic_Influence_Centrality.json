{"id":"257246672_Message_Passing_Optimization_of_Harmonic_Influence_Centrality","abstract":"This paper proposes a new measure of node centrality in social networks, the\nHarmonic Influence Centrality, which emerges naturally in the study of social\ninfluence over networks. Using an intuitive analogy between social and\nelectrical networks, we introduce a distributed message passing algorithm to\ncompute the Harmonic Influence Centrality of each node. Although its design is\nbased on theoretical results which assume the network to have no cycle, the\nalgorithm can also be successfully applied on general graphs.","authors":["Luca Vassio","Fabio Fagnani","Paolo Frasca","Asuman E.
