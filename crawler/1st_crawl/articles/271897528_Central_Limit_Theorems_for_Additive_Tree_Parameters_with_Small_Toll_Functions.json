{"id":"271897528_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_Additive_Tree_Parameters_with_Small_Toll_Functions","abstract":"We call a tree parameter additive if it can be determined recursively as the sum of the parameter values of all branches, plus a certain toll function. In this paper, we prove central limit theorems for very general toll functions, provided that they are bounded and small on average. Simply generated families of trees are considered as well as PÃ³lya trees, recursive trees and binary search trees, and the results are illustrated by several examples of parameters for which we prove normal or log-normal limit laws.","authors":["Stephan Georg Wagner"],"meta":["January 2014Combinatorics Probability and Computing 24(01):1-25","DOI:10.1017/S0963548314000443"],"references":["259420889_Limit_Theorems_for_Subtree_Size_Profiles_of_Increasing_Trees","231818474_Limiting_Distributions_for_Path_Lengths_in_Recursive_Trees","221218921_Varieties_of_Increasing_Trees","220533452_Phase_Changes_in_Subtree_Varieties_in_Random_Recursive_and_Binary_Search_Trees","41448325_Conditional_limit_theorems_for_branching_processes","30825085_The_distribution_of_degrees_in_a_large_random_tree","2482937_Phase_Change_of_Limit_Laws_in_the_Quicksort_Recurrence_Under_Varying_Toll_Functions","305975807_On_the_total_heights_of_random_rooted_trees","285843680_The_distribution_of_nodes_of_given_degree_in_random_trees","268852446_On_the_expected_distance_from_the_centroid_of_a_tree","268534991_On_subtrees_of_certain_families_of_rooted_trees","267125313_Additive_tree_functionals_with_small_toll_functions_and_subtrees_of_random_trees","267120942_Random_trees_An_interplay_between_combinatorics_and_probability","266529755_Distribution_properties_of_induced_subgraphs_of_trees","256693751_On_centroid_branches_of_trees_from_certain_families","243716387_The_number_of_trees","239030788_On_the_Altitude_of_Nodes_in_Random_Trees","227705379_Limit_Laws_for_Local_Counters_in_Random_Binary_Search_Tree","222694419_Limiting_distributions_for_additive_functionals_on_Catalan_trees","222649757_Singularity_analysis_Hadamard_products_and_tree_recurrences","222544163_The_Shape_of_Unlabeled_Rooted_Random_Trees","220617534_Limit_Laws_for_Sums_of_Functions_of_Subtrees_of_Random_Binary_Search_Trees","220345415_On_the_log-product_of_the_subtree-sizes_of_random_trees","220345411_Patterns_in_Random_Binary_Search_Trees","220345355_On_the_distribution_of_binary_search_trees_under_the_random_permutation_model","220296595_Addendum_Twelve_Countings_with_Rooted_Plane_Trees","220186805_On_the_number_of_induced_subgraphs_of_trees","220078365_On_the_average_number_of_nodes_in_a_subtree_of_a_tree","220078267_The_average_order_of_a_subtree_of_a_tree","38363009_Asymptotic_Fringe_Distributions_for_General_Families_of_Random_Trees","2873968_Twelve_Countings_With_Rooted_Plane_Trees","2559708_Analytic_Combinatorics","2476231_Asymptotic_Degree_Distribution_In_Random_Recursive_Trees","2475861_On_Convergence_Rates_in_the_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_Combinatorial_Structures","2459774_The_Distribution_Of_Nodes_Of_Given_Degree_In_Random_Trees","2409775_The_Wiener_Index_Of_Simply_Generated_Random_Trees","2353441_Total_Path_Length_for_Random_Recursive_Trees"]}
