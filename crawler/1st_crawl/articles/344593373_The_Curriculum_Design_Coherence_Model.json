{"id":"344593373_The_Curriculum_Design_Coherence_Model","abstract":"Auckland University, Sheffield Hallam University, and Keele and North\nStaffordshire Teacher Education are collaborating to develop a curriculum\ndesign tool (Rata, 2019) that informs an appreciation of subject coherence and\ndevelops teacher curriculum design expertise. Our initial findings suggest that\nseparating subject concepts, subject content and subject competencies enables\nteachers to effectively design the curriculum using the logical order imposed by\nthe Curriculum Design Coherence (CDC) model. These distinctions can be made\nclear to students through specialised curriculum language. As a longitudinal\nmodel, and as a logic, the CDC approach contributes to and promotes\ncurriculum thinking. It works on the basis that the curriculum is the progression\nmodel, enabling teachers to identify powerful knowledge as the hooks for a\nspiral curriculum that provides a strong narrative for learning and teaching.","authors":["Richard Pountney"],"meta":["March 2020","Conference: A RESEARCH APPROACH TO CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENTAt: Alfred Salter Primary School, Rotherhithe, London,"],"references":["332237782_Learner_Agency_and_the_Curriculum_a_Critical_Realist_Perspective","320600258_The_contribution_of_vocabulary_knowledge_and_semantic_orthographic_fluency_to_text_quality_through_elementary_school_in_Catalan","281440747_Developing_teachers_as_agents_of_inclusion_and_social_justice","271407202_Measuring_productive_elements_of_multi-word_phrase_vocabulary_knowledge_among_children_with_English_as_an_additional_or_only_language","249020088_The_contribution_of_special_education_to_our_understanding_of_values_schooling_and_the_curriculum","333376145_Knowledge-rich_teaching_A_model_of_curriculum_design_coherence","284897938_Pedagogies_for_inclusion_of_students_with_disabilities_in_a_national_curriculum_A_central_human_capabilities_approach","262244978_Second_language_learning_in_the_early_schools_years_Trends_and_Contexts","248994759_The_Political_Construction_of_the_'Whole_Curriculum'"]}
