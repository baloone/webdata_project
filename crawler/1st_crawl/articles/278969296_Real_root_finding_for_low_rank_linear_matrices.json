{"id":"278969296_Real_root_finding_for_low_rank_linear_matrices","abstract":"The problem of finding low rank $m\\times m$ matrices in a real affine\nsubspace of dimension n has many applications in information and systems\ntheory, where low rank is synonymous of structure and parcimony. We design a\nsymbolic computation algorithm to solve this problem efficiently, exactly and\nrigorously: the input are the rational coefficients of the matrices spanning\nthe affine subspace as well as the expected maximum rank, and the output is a\nrational parametrization encoding a finite set of points that intersects each\nconnected component of the low rank real algebraic set. The complexity of our\nalgorithm is studied thoroughly. It is essentially polynomial in\nbinomial(n+m(m--r),n) where r is the expected maximum rank; it improves on the\nstate-of-the-art in the field. Moreover, computer experiments show the\npractical efficiency of our approach.","authors":["Didier Henrion","Simone Naldi","Mohab Safey El Din"],"meta":["March 2020Applicable Algebra in Engineering Communication and Computing 31(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00200-019-00396-w","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281084615_Exact_Algorithms_for_Linear_Matrix_Inequalities","321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","313364158_Low_Rank_Approximation_Algorithms_Implementation_Applications","309738747_SPECTRA_-a_Maple_library_for_solving_linear_matrix_inequalities_in_exact_arithmetic","309701573_A_Nearly_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Deciding_Connectivity_Queries_in_Smooth_and_Bounded_Real_Algebraic_Sets","308913123_Distortion_Varieties","308362419_Exact_algorithms_for_linear_matrix_inequalities","303488949_Bit_complexity_for_multi-homogeneous_polynomial_system_solving_Application_to_polynomial_minimization","301819732_Determinantal_Sets_Singularities_and_Application_to_Optimal_Control_in_Medical_Imagery","279366745_International_Series_in_Operations_Research_Management_Science"]}
