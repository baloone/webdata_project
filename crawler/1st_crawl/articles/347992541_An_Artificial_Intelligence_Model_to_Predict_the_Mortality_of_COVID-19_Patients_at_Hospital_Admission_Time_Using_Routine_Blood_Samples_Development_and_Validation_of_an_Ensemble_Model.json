{"id":"347992541_An_Artificial_Intelligence_Model_to_Predict_the_Mortality_of_COVID-19_Patients_at_Hospital_Admission_Time_Using_Routine_Blood_Samples_Development_and_Validation_of_an_Ensemble_Model","abstract":"Background: COVID-19, which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress, multiple organ failure, and death, has spread worldwide much faster than previously thought. However, at present, it has limited treatments. Objective: To overcome this issue, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model of COVID-19, named EDRnet (ensemble learning model based on deep neural network and random forest models), to predict in-hospital mortality using a routine blood sample at the time of hospital admission. Methods: We selected 28 blood biomarkers and used the age and gender information of patients as model inputs. To improve the mortality prediction, we adopted an ensemble approach combining deep neural network and random forest models. We trained our model with a database of blood samples from 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and applied it to 106 COVID-19 patients in three Korean medical institutions. Results: In the testing data sets, EDRnet provided high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91%), and accuracy (92%). To extend the number of patient data points, we developed a web application (BeatCOVID19) where anyone can access the model to predict mortality and can register his or her own blood laboratory results. Conclusions: Our new AI model, EDRnet, accurately predicts the mortality rate for COVID-19. It is publicly available and aims to help health care providers fight COVID-19 and improve patientsâ€™ outcomes.","authors":["Hoon Ko","Heewon Chung","Wu","Seong Kang"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Medical Internet Research 22(12):e25442"],"references":["343972529_Early_coagulation_tests_predict_risk_stratification_and_prognosis_of_COVID-19","343957961_Predictive_value_of_neutrophil_to_lymphocyte_and_platelet_to_lymphocyte_ratio_in_COVID-19","343864549_Severe_Coronavirus_disease_2019_pneumonia_patients_showed_signs_of_aggravated_renal_impairment","342816889_Higher_level_of_Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte_is_associated_with_severe_COVID-19","342718217_Clinical_evaluation_of_potential_usefulness_of_serum_lactate_dehydrogenase_LDH_in_2019_novel_coronavirus_COVID-19_pneumonia","342275729_D-Dimer_and_Prothrombin_Time_Are_the_Significant_Indicators_of_Severe_COVID-19_and_Poor_Prognosis","344234598_Low_levels_of_total_and_ionized_calcium_in_blood_of_COVID-19_patients","343882930_Lactate_dehydrogenase_An_old_enzyme_reborn_as_a_COVID-19_marker_and_not_only","343660365_Elevated_Lactate_Dehydrogenase_LDH_level_as_an_independent_risk_factor_for_the_severity_and_mortality_of_COVID-19","342472279_Serum_calcium_as_a_biomarker_of_clinical_severity_and_prognosis_in_patients_with_coronavirus_disease_2019"]}
