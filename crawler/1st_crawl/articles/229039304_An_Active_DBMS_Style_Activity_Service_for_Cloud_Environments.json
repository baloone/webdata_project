{"id":"229039304_An_Active_DBMS_Style_Activity_Service_for_Cloud_Environments","abstract":"We propose an activity service as a component in cloud computing with the particular novelty that we base this service on the well-defined and proven semantics of Active Database Management Systems (Active DBMS). In addition, we utilize well-known principles of service oriented architectures. Furthermore we aim to provide an integration with a cloud service mediation component to automatically react to changes occurring in the cloud environment and in this way to imple-ment agility and self management of cloud applications. As contribution of this paper we provide the high-level design of this activity service. This includes architecture, core interfaces and a semantically well-defined rule and execution model, based on extended Active DBMS semantics.","authors":["Marc Schaaf","Arne Koschel","Stella Gatziu Grivas","Irina Astrova"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["221542944_Event_Cloud_-_Searching_for_Correlated_Business_Events","221399931_Cloud_Broker_Bringing_Intelligence_into_the_Cloud","304620857_Above_the_clouds_A_berkeley_view_of_cloud_computing","255664408_Active_Rules_in_Database_Systems","242556447_Event_Monitoring_Web_Services_for_Heterogeneous_Information_Systems","242100716_Active_Database_Systems_Triggers_and_Rules_For_Advanced_Database_Processing","228090867_Enterprise_SOA_-_Service-Oriented_Architecture_Best_Practices","227279341_The_Power_of_Events_An_Introduction_to_Complex_Event_Processing_in_Distributed_Enterprise_Systems","222368210_Distributed_events_in_active_database_systems_Letting_the_genie_out_of_the_bottle","221400052_Policy-Based_Event-Driven_Services-Oriented_Architecture_for_Cloud_Services_Operation_Management"]}
