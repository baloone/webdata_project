{"id":"286245681_Strict_Minimizers_For_Geometric_Optimization","abstract":"We introduce the idea of strict minimizers for geometric distortion measures used in shape interpolation, deformation, parametrization, and other applications involving geometric mappings. The L-infinity-norm ensures the tightest possible control on the worst-case distortion. Unfortunately, it does not yield a unique solution and does not distinguish between solutions with high or low distortion below the maximum. The strict minimizer is a minimal L infinity-norm solution, which always prioritizes higher distortion reduction. We propose practical algorithms for computing strict minimizers. We also offer an efficient algorithm for L-infinity optimization based on the ARAP energy. This algorithm can be used on its own or as a building block for an ARAP strict minimizer. We demonstrate that these algorithms lead to significant improvements in quality.","authors":["Zohar Levi","Denis Zorin"],"meta":["November 2014ACM Transactions on Graphics 33(6):1-14","DOI:10.1145/2661229.2661258"],"references":["279257597_State_of_the_Art_in_Quad_Meshing","268059056_Geometric_Surface_and_Brain_Warping_via_Geodesic_Minimizing_Lipschitz_Extensions","260061886_Planar_Shape_Interpolation_with_Bounded_Distortion","235164989_MIPS_An_Efficient_Global_Parametrization_Method","226873238_Parameterization_of_Faceted_Surfaces_for_Meshing_using_Angle-Based_Flattening","226105699_On_implementing_a_primal-dual_interior-point_method_for_conic_quadratic_programming","220184511_Periodic_Global_Parameterization","220183739_Least_Squares_Conformal_Maps_for_Automatic_Texture_Atlas_Generation","4006100_Bounded-distortion_piecewise_mesh_parametrization","314741452_Global_parametrization_by_incremental_flattening","285051130_Sur_un_algorithm_toujours_convergent_pour_obtenir_les_polynomes_de_meilleure_approximation_de_Tchebycheff_pour_une_fonction_continue_quelconque","274531640_The_Lawson_Algorithm_and_Extensions","273170706_Smooth_Rotation_Enhanced_As-Rigid-As-Possible_Mesh_Animation","263103111_Locally_Injective_Mappings","262411900_Controlled-Distortion_Constrained_Global_Parametrization","262352155_Integer-Grid_Maps_for_Reliable_Quad_Meshing","262202659_Injective_and_Bounded_Distortion_Mappings_in_3D","262166263_Computing_Extremal_Quasiconformal_Maps","261783755_Approximations_in_Lp_and_Chebyshev_Approximations","257686835_L_p_shape_deformation","254461925_Global_Parametrization_by_Incremental_Flattening","254461924_Bounded_Distortion_Mapping_Spaces_for_Triangular_Meshes","247699582_Tchebycheff_approximation_in_a_compact_metric_space","243076072_Tchebycheff_Approximation_in_Several_Variables","238834051_Computing_the_Strict_Chebyshev_Solution_of_Overdetermined_Linear_Equations","238831399_Approximations_in_Lp_and_Chebyshev_Approximations","225729847_Strict_approximation_on_closed_convex_sets","223350486_Lexicographic_optimality_in_the_multiple_objective_linear_programming_The_nucleolar_solution","223125581_Transforming_Triangulations","223112393_Resource_Allocation_Among_Competing_Activities_A_Lexicographic_Minimax_Approach","221316589_As-Rigid-As-Possible_Surface_Modeling","220507384_As-Killing-As-Possible_Vector_Fields_for_Planar_Deformation","220507351_QuadCover_-_Surface_Parameterization_using_Branched_Coverings","220507105_Conformal_Flattening_by_Curvature_Prescription_and_Metric_Scaling","220506161_Intrinsic_Parameterizations_of_Surface_Meshes","220458664_The_Calculation_of_Linear_Best_L_p_Approximations","220183961_Discrete_Conformal_Mappings_via_Circle_Patterns","220183598_Mixed-Integer_Quadrangulation","45417665_Conformal_Equivalence_of_Triangle_Meshes","38412923_A_LocalGlobal_Approach_to_Mesh_Parameterization","4941949_A_simplex_based_algorithm_for_the_lexicographically_extended_linear_maxmin_problem","2538876_As-Rigid-As-Possible_Shape_Interpolation"]}
