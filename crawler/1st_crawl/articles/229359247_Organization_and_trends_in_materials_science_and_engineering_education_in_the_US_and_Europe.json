{"id":"229359247_Organization_and_trends_in_materials_science_and_engineering_education_in_the_US_and_Europe","abstract":"Materials education in the United States and Europe is today provided to students by a wide range of departments, programs and institutes. Only a small fraction of these are what we term “core MSE” departments. These departments practice the discipline of MSE, providing undergraduate and graduate education in, and carrying out research on, the four elements of the field and their interrelations. The elements are structure, processing, properties and performance. Viewing this MSE as a discipline (while simultaneously as a part of a larger discipline) provides new directions for, and freedom in, curriculum reform. It also provides a framework for developing a focus for our research efforts and guiding their direction.","authors":["M. C.
