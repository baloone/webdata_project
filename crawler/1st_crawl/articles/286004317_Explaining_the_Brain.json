{"id":"286004317_Explaining_the_Brain","abstract":"What distinguishes good explanations in neuroscience from bad? This book constructs and defends standards for evaluating neuroscientific explanations that are grounded in a systematic view of what neuroscientific explanations are: descriptions of multilevel mechanisms. In developing this approach, it draws on a wide range of examples in the history of neuroscience (e.g., Hodgkin and Huxley's model of the action potential and LTP as a putative explanation for different kinds of memory), as well as recent philosophical work on the nature of scientific explanation.","authors":["Carl Craver"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199299317.001.0001"],"references":["286631209_The_hippocampus_in_pieces_and_patches_An_essay_on_modes_of_explanation_in_physiological_psychology","227245199_Explaining_Disease_Correlations_Causes_and_Mechanisms","24176290_Mechanism_vitalism_and_organicism_in_late_nineteenth_and_twentieth-century_biology_The_importance_of_historical_context","293075234_Causation_Transparency_and_Emphasis","291050271_Les_fondements_de_la_geometrie_des_corps","284855181_Synaptic_plasticity_in_the_hippocampal_formation","284475385_Teleological_functional_analyses_and_the_hierarchical_organization_of_nature","281233588_Hormones_and_behavior_The_biology_of_thirst_and_sodium_appetite","270375796_The_Problem_of_the_Many_Many_Composition_Questions_and_Naive_Mereology","257556680_Introduction","249081361_What_Do_Brain_Data_Really_Show","249081357_Capacities_Universality_and_Singularity","249080994_Explanatory_Unification_and_the_Problem_of_Asymmetry","249080468_An_At-At_Theory_of_Causal_Influence","246143492_Explanation_Invariance_and_Intervention","243712656_Retrieving_general_and_specific_information_from_stored_knowledge_af_specifics","240547973_Objectivity_in_Experimental_Inquiry_Breaking_Data-Technique_Circles","239066018_Testing_Models_of_Cognition_Through_the_Analysis_of_Brain-Damaged_Performance","238827029_Neuroscience_New_Knockout_Mice_Point_to_Molecular_Basis_of_Memory","238689619_Reduction_elimination_and_levels_The_case_of_the_LTP-learning_link","237130849_More_on_Making_Mind_Matter","230242720_Referring_to_Events","226620851_Part-Whole_Physicalism_and_Mental_Causation","226532830_Theory_structure_reduction_and_disciplinary_integration_in_biology","226228180_A_theory_of_singular_causal_explanation","225974322_Hempel's_Ambiguity","24176289_Mechanisms_of_Life_in_the_Seventeenth_Century_Borelli_Perrault_Regis","21178374_Problems_of_Learning_and_Memory_One_or_Multiple_Memory_Systems","18997537_Electroencephalographic_correlates_of_learning_in_subcortical_and_cortical_structures","17509682_Simultaneous_Recording_of_Membrane_Potential_Calcium_Transient_and_Tension_in_Single_Muscle_Fibres","14228206_Spatial_Learning_and_Memory_The_Beginning_of_a_Dream","13404740_Silencing_the_Controversy_in_LTP","12455495_The_potential_effectiveness_of_simulations_versus_phenomenological_models","12031917_A_neuron_doctrine_in_the_philosophy_of_neuroscience","11741290_The_peripherality_of_reductionism_in_the_development_of_molecular_biology","10943666_Na_channel_Nav19_In_search_of_a_gating_mechanism","10766326_A_prelude_to_long-term_potentiation","9347029_Electrophysiological_studies_of_hippocampal_neurons_III_Responses_of_hippocampal_neurons_to_repetitive_perforant_path_volleys","8986233_Neural_Mechanisms_of_cortico-cortical_interaction_in_texture_boundary_detection_A_Modeling_approach","8308000_Post-tetanic_potentiation_of_response_in_monosynaptie_reflex_pathway_of_the_spinal_cord","8063831_Voltage-gated_ion_channels"]}
