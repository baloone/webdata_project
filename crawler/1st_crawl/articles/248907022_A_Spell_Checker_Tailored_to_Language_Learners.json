{"id":"248907022_A_Spell_Checker_Tailored_to_Language_Learners","abstract":"This paper presents a spell checker catering to the specific needs of language learners. Three methods for retrieving correction proposals are discussed: (i) the alpha-code method which is often used in spell checkers and which is particularly adequate for missing diacritics and many typing errors; (ii) the phonological reinterpretation method, which retrieves corrections for words written phonetically; and (iii) an ad hoc method treating a specific type of morphological error, pending the implementation of a more complete morphological treatment. Although not yet implemented, different ways to order the retrieved spelling corrections are proposed. Tests of the system were performed and those are compared to the results of a commercially available spell checker. Leads for further research are then offered.","authors":["Mar Ndiaye","Anne Vandeventer Faltin"],"meta":["July 2003Computer Assisted Language Learning 16(2-3):213-232","DOI:10.1076/call.16.2.213.15881"],"references":["200111340_Speech_and_Language_Processing_An_Introduction_to_Natural_Language_Processing_Computational_Linguistics_and_Speech_Recognition","2899403_FipsVox_a_French_TTS_based_on_a_syntactic_parser","2291819_Towards_A_Complete_Detectioncorrection_System","262221905_Automatic_spelling_correction_in_scientific_and_scholar_text","220425101_Computer_programs_for_detecting_and_correcting_spelling_errors"]}
