{"id":"272845279_Scaling_limits_of_random_P'olya_trees","abstract":"P\\'olya trees are rooted trees considered up to symmetry. We establish the\nconvergence of large uniform random P\\'olya trees with arbitrary degree\nrestrictions to Aldous' Continuum Random Tree with respect to the\nGromov-Hausdorff metric. Our proof is short and elementary, and it shows that\nthe global shape of a random P\\'olya tree is essentially dictated by a large\nGalton-Watson tree that it contains. We also derive sub-Gaussian tail bounds\nfor both the height and the width, which are optimal up to constant factors in\nthe exponent.","authors":["Konstantinos Panagiotou","Benedikt Stufler"],"meta":["April 2018Probability Theory and Related Fields 170(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00440-017-0770-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["277333848_Scaling_limits_of_random_outerplanar_maps_with_independent_link-weights","269877042_The_continuum_random_tree_is_the_scaling_limit_of_unlabeled_unrooted_trees","249387956_Counting_Rooted_Trees_The_Universal_Law_tnC_-n_n-32","268079479_Scaling_Limits_of_Random_Graphs_from_Subcritical_Classes","268023750_Graphical_enumeration_problems","262189826_The_Scaling_Limit_of_Random_Outerplanar_Maps","256105520_Une_theorie_combinatoire_des_series_formelles","247818733_The_Continuum_Random_Tree_II_an_overview","245588336_Boltzmann_Sampling_of_Unlabelled_Structures","243716387_The_number_of_trees"]}
