{"id":"274903017_CONSERT_Applying_semantic_web_technologies_to_context_modeling_in_ambient_intelligence","abstract":"Representation and reasoning about context information is a main research area in Ambient Intelligence (AmI). Context modeling in such applications is facing openness and heterogeneity. To tackle such problems, we argue that usage of semantic web technologies is a promising direction. We introduce CONSERT, an approach for context meta-modeling offering a consistent and uniform means for working with domain knowledge, as well as constraints and meta-properties thereof. We provide a formalization of the model and detail its innovative implementation using techniques from the semantic web community such as ontology modeling and SPARQL. A stepwise example of modeling a commonly encountered AmI scenario showcases the expressiveness of our approach. Finally, the architecture of the representation and reasoning engine for CONSERT is presented and evaluated in terms of performance.","authors":["Alexandru Sorici","Gauthier Picard","Olivier Boissier","Antoine Zimmermann"],"meta":["April 2015Computers & Electrical Engineering 44","DOI:10.1016/j.compeleceng.2015.03.012"],"references":["335106445_LiDAR-Video_Driving_Dataset_Learning_Driving_Policies_Effectively","334287302_The_ApolloScape_Open_Dataset_for_Autonomous_Driving_and_Its_Application","320426641_A_Low_Cost_Sensors_Approach_for_Accurate_Vehicle_Localization_and_Autonomous_Driving_Application","301880609_The_Cityscapes_Dataset_for_Semantic_Urban_Scene_Understanding","301648615_End_to_End_Learning_for_Self-Driving_Cars","258140919_Vision_meets_robotics_the_KITTI_dataset","254462020_Fusion_of_background_knowledge_and_streams_of_events","248203633_Understanding_and_Using_Context_Personal_and_Ubiquitous_Computing_Journal","236627583_Context_Aware_Computing_for_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","236011683_SP-ACT_A_hybrid_framework_for_complex_activity_recognition_combining_OWL_and_SPARQL_rules","228996837_CroCo_Ontology-Based_Cross-Application_Context_Management","228344444_Representing_Context_in_an_Agent_Architecture_for_Context-Based_Decision_Making","226133594_The_SOUPA_ontology_for_pervasive_computing","225538273_Experiences_in_Using_CCPP_in_Context-Aware_Systems","225007916_CoOL_A_Context_Ontology_Language_to_Enable_Contextual_Interoperability","221187764_SAGE_A_Logical_Agent-Based_Environment_Monitoring_and_Control_System","220141486_Understanding_and_Using_Context","220135828_Ontology-based_activity_recognition_in_intelligent_pervasive_environments","220072522_Defeasible_Contextual_Reasoning_with_Arguments_in_Ambient_Intelligence","5176432_Description_Logic_Programs_Combining_Logic_Programs_with_Description_Logic","4090743_SOUPA_standard_ontology_for_ubiquitous_and_pervasive_applications","334437257_Is_It_Safe_to_Drive_An_Overview_of_Factors_Metrics_and_Datasets_for_Driveability_Assessment_in_Autonomous_Driving","329747827_Toward_Driving_Scene_Understanding_A_Dataset_for_Learning_Driver_Behavior_and_Causal_Reasoning","329638183_DeepTest_automated_testing_of_deep-neural-network-driven_autonomous_cars","328457937_Failure_Prediction_for_Autonomous_Driving","327811384_End-to-End_Driving_Via_Conditional_Imitation_Learning","326341479_A_General_Framework_for_Representing_Reasoning_and_Querying_with_Annotated_Semantic_Web_Data","322058545_Revisiting_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Data_in_Deep_Learning_Era","320971948_End-to-End_Learning_of_Driving_Models_from_Large-Scale_Video_Datasets","319277639_End-To-End_Ego_Lane_Estimation_Based_on_Sequential_Transfer_Learning_for_Self-Driving_Cars","319121665_Deep_Steering_Learning_End-to-End_Driving_Model_from_Spatial_and_Temporal_Visual_Cues","311240888_1_year_1000_km_The_Oxford_RobotCar_dataset","269032076_Description_logic_programs","258448724_Algebraic_Structures_for_Capturing_the_Provenance_of_SPARQL_Queries","244518807_Towards_a_hybrid_approach_to_context_modelling_reasoning_and_interoperation","225455624_Annotated_RDF","225019566_Ontology-Based_Context_Modeling","222574839_Named_Graphs","222473635_Theory_of_generalized_annotated_logic_programming_and_its_applications","221466795_A_Semantic_Context-Aware_Access_Control_Framework_for_Secure_Collaborations_in_Pervasive_Computing_Environments","221024038_EP-SPARQL_A_unified_language_for_event_processing_and_stream_reasoning","220613616_Annotated_RDF","220310550_OWL_2_Modeling_and_Reasoning_with_Complex_Human_Activities","220310544_A_survey_of_context_modeling_and_reasoning_techniques","50292155_A_General_Framework_for_Representing_Reasoning_and_Querying_withAnnotated_Semantic_Web_Data","43467216_A_framework_for_context-aware_pervasive_computing_applications","4123993_A_metamodel_approach_to_context_information","2895942_An_Ontology-based_Context_Model_in_Intelligent_Environments"]}
