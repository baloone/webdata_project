{"id":"262256284_On_the_best_rank-1_and_rank-R_1_R_2_R_N_approximation_of_higher-order_tensors","abstract":"In this paper we discuss a multilinear generalization of the best rank-R approximation problem for matrices, namely, the approximation of a given higher-order tensor, in an optimal least-squares sense, by a tensor that has prespecified column rank value, row rank value, etc. For matrices, the solution is conceptually obtained by truncation of the singular value decomposition (SVD); however, this approach does not have a straightforward multilinear counterpart. We discuss higher-order generalizations of the power method and the orthogonal iteration method.","authors":["Lieven De Lathauwer","Bart L.R.
