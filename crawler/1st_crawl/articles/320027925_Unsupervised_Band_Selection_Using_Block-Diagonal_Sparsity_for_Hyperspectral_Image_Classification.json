{"id":"320027925_Unsupervised_Band_Selection_Using_Block-Diagonal_Sparsity_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","abstract":"In order to alleviate the negative effect of curse of dimensionality, band selection is a crucial step for hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. In this letter, we propose a novel unsupervised band selection approach to reduce the dimensionality for hyperspectral imagery. In order to obtain the most representative bands, the correlation matrix computed from the original HSI is used to describe the correlation characteristics among bands, while the block-diagonal structure is measured to segment all bands into a series of subspace. After applying the spectral clustering algorithm, the optimal combination of band is finally selected. To verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed band selection method, experiments have been conducted on three widely used real-world hyperspectral data. The results have shown that the proposed method outperforms other methods in HSI classification application.","authors":["Jingyu Wang","Ke Zhang","Pei Wang","Kurosh Madani"],"meta":["September 2017IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters PP(99):1-5","DOI:10.1109/LGRS.2017.2751082"],"references":["298427600_A_Symmetric_Sparse_Representation_Based_Band_Selection_Method_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery_Classification","264984021_A_New_Sparsity-Based_Band_Selection_Method_for_Target_Detection_of_Hyperspectral_Image","264743774_Unsupervised_Band_Selection_by_Integrating_the_Overall_Accuracy_and_Redundancy","262391178_Correlation_Adaptive_Subspace_Segmentation_by_Trace_Lasso","3205663_Clustering-Based_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_Using_Information_Measures","3204105_Constrained_band_selection_for_hyperspectral_imagery","3204068_Independent_component_analysis-based_dimensionality_reduction_with_applications_in_hyperspectral_image_analysis","3202897_Target_signature-constrained_mixed_pixel_classification_for_hyperspectral_imagery","305741540_Band_selection_and_evaluation_with_spatial_information","299375151_Sparse_and_Low-Rank_Graph_for_Discriminant_Analysis_of_Hyperspectral_Imagery","298902600_Salient_Band_Selection_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_via_Manifold_Ranking","283246773_Dual-Clustering-Based_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_by_Contextual_Analysis","283203685_Unsupervised_Band_Selection_Based_on_Evolutionary_Multiobjective_Optimization_for_Hyperspectral_Images","282546574_Unsupervised_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_by_Dominant_Set_Extraction","282543927_A_Novel_Ranking-Based_Clustering_Approach_for_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection","281466983_Unsupervised_feature_selection_based_on_maximum_information_and_minimum_redundancy_for_hyperspectral_images","275256889_Band_Selection_Using_Improved_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery_Classification","274095166_Unsupervised_Hyperspectral_Image_Band_Selection_via_Column_Subset_Selection","273507403_Efficient_Unsupervised_Band_Selection_Through_Spectral_Rhythms","265911421_A_Sparse_Representation-Based_Binary_Hypothesis_Model_for_Target_Detection_in_Hyperspectral_Images","260711623_Progressive_Band_Selection_of_Spectral_Unmixing_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery","260623018_Locality-Preserving_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Classification_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Analysis","236061588_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering_Algorithm_Theory_and_Applications","224306620_Efficient_Hierarchical-PCA_Dimension_Reduction_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery","216301644_Hierarchical_Grouping_to_Optimize_an_Objective_Function","3449517_Visual_Method_for_Spectral_Band_Selection","3201466_An_Extension_of_the_Jeffreys-Matusita_Distance_to_Multiclass_Cases_for_Feature_Selection"]}
