{"id":"280574182_The_Self-Promotion_of_Academic_Textbooks_in_the_Preface_Section_A_Genre_Analysis","abstract":"This paper presents a genre analysis of the preface section in academic textbooks, specifically twenty-two preface sections from the closely-related fields of linguistics and applied linguistics. Using a move structure analysis such as those proposed by Swales (1990) and Bhatia (1993), four moves were identified to account for the different rhetorical purposes employed by writers of preface sections to create a niche and establish the importance of their textbooks. These moves comprise: establishing the needs of the readership, establishing their orientations like purpose and audiences, outlining of the scope of the chapters, and finally acknowledgments. This move structure reflects the textual strategies used by writers to achieve the rhetorical purposes of the preface sections. It is suggested that these findings could be incorporated into instructional literature for writers wishing to start book projects, and that they may also be helpful for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers in selecting materials for their classrooms based on their external evaluation of academic textbooks.","authors":["Ali Sorayyaei Azar"],"meta":["December 2012Atlantis 34(2):147-165","Project: Genre Analysis and Corpus Linguistics"],"references":["329424043_How_conceptual_structure_impinges_on_constructional_behavior_The_case_of_give_verbs","350652447_American_Science_Fiction_and_the_Cold_War","349140703_El_espacio_conventual_en_Michele_Roberts","346644499_Text_Role_and_Context_Developing_Academic_Literacies","344497445_University_Language_A_corpus-based_study_of_spoken_and_written_registers","344477877_Music_in_Everyday_Life","332707940_Illocutionary_constructions_Cognitive_motivation_and_linguistic_realization","332560619_Between_Men_English_Literature_and_Male_Homosocial_Desire","329871921_Support_from_Language_Processing_for_a_Constructional_Approach_to_Grammar","326569185_An_Introduction_to_Applied_Linguistics","321545825_Byromania_Portraits_of_the_Artist_in_Nineteenth-_and_Twentieth-Century_Culture","319395432_Understanding_media_The_extensions_of_man","318105978_Discourse_Analysis_for_Language_Teachers","316753806_Male_Myths_and_Icons","316270500_Positions_and_Presuppositions_in_Science_Fiction"]}
