{"id":"325155924_Performance_Analysis_of_Internet_of_Things_Application_Layer_Protocol","abstract":"This paper deals with the modeling and performance analysis of the widely used protocol in the Inernet of Things (IoT). Developing a successful IoT application or protocol is still not an easy task due to multiple challenges such as mobility, reliability, scalability, management, availability, interoperability, and security. Therefore, the implementation of protocols for IoT must comply the standards and satisfy the good properties. The formal methods can meet these conditions. The MQTT protocol is currently considered one of the most serious candidates for transporting data within IoT architectures. The contribution of this original paper is outlined in the formal modeling and performance evaluation of MQTT 3.1.1 using timed and probabilistic automata and statistical model checker, respectively, provided in UPPAAL SMC tool-set.","authors":["Manel Houimli","Laid Kahloul","Siham Benaoune"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-91337-7_22","In book: Lecture Notes in Real-Time Intelligent Systems (pp.225-234)"],"references":["309083421_Web_Performance_Evaluation_for_Internet_of_Things_Applications","308696915_STATISTICAL_MODEL_CHECKING_of_CSMACA_in_WSNs","281773681_Energy_Efficient_Green_Routing_Protocol_for_Internet_of_Multimedia_Things","281466879_Modeling_and_Analyzing_CSMACA_Protocol_for_Energy-Harvesting_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","279177017_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey_on_Enabling_Technologies_Protocols_and_Applications","272641092_Security_for_the_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey_of_Existing_Protocols_and_Open_Research_Issues","270596354_Uppaal_SMC_tutorial","265645605_Formal_modeling_and_verification_of_an_enhanced_variant_of_the_IEEE_80211_CSMACA_protocol","226708816_Symbolic_Computation_of_Maximal_Probabilisti_Reachability","221188980_Modelling_PublishSubscribe_Communication_Systems_Towards_a_Formal_Approach","308848469_RPL-based_multipath_Routing_Protocols_for_Internet_of_Things_on_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","286651721_Internet_of_Things_application_layer_protocol_analysis_over_error_and_delay_prone_links","282780363_Simulation_and_analysis_of_authentication_protocols_for_mobile_Internet_of_Things_MIoT","261059025_Performance_evaluation_of_end-to-end_security_protocols_in_an_Internet_of_Things","238713228_The_IPsec_Security_Architecture_for_the_Internet_Protocol","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","224257377_A_Petri-Net_Model_for_the_Publish-Subscribe_Paradigm_and_Its_Application_for_the_Verification_of_the_BonjourGrid_Middleware","221109150_BonjourGrid_as_a_Decentralised_Job_Scheduler"]}
