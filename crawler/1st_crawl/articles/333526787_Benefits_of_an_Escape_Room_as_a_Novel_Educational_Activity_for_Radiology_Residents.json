{"id":"333526787_Benefits_of_an_Escape_Room_as_a_Novel_Educational_Activity_for_Radiology_Residents","abstract":"Rationale and objectives: \nWe created a radiology Escape Room, a competitive game where a team of players must discover clues and solve a mystery to escape a \"locked\" room. To succeed, players must collaborate and think critically and creatively. Our objectives were to provide a novel team-building activity, teach interesting content about radiology as a specialty, cultivate grit, and share the game with other programs.\n\nMaterials and methods: \nEscape Rooms were held during orientation (BOOT Camp) for incoming radiology residents and for upper level residents and faculty with advanced content (four teams totaling 20 residents and faculty). We repeated the Escape Room 27 times for 144 residents from more than 10 countries at Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2018.\n\nResults: \nPlayers were engaged and competitive. They were able to connect the activity to their future responsibilities - analyzing knowledge under pressure (being on call), communicating effectively (conveying results and recommendations), having the dexterity and motor skills required for physical puzzles (hand-on procedures), being able to multi-task and come up with differential diagnoses under extreme stress and time pressure (being on call). A post-RSNA survey confirmed satisfaction with the activity, with overall enjoyment receiving the highest rating.\n\nConclusion: \nIt is feasible to create a portable, inexpensive Escape Room as a novel educational platform for radiology residents. Combining knowledge-based challenges and technical skills in a live-action game simulated a real-life situation in which vital patient information must be collected and reported concisely and accurately. A Game Guide is available to program directors and medical educators upon request.","authors":["Kedar Jambhekar","Rachel P.
