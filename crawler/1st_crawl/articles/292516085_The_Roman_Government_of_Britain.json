{"id":"292516085_The_Roman_Government_of_Britain","abstract":"This work is a completely rewritten version of The Fasti of Roman Britain (1981), with biographical entries for all senior officers and higher officials who served in the island from AD 43 to 409. All new governors, legionary legates, senatorial tribunes, procurators, and fleet prefects discovered since 1981 are included, and the entries for those previously known are revised. Translations of all sources are also added in this edition. There are sections on local government; governor's staff; the careers of senators and procurators in the principate; the subdivisions into Upper and Lower Britain, then into four, and finally five, provinces; and the late Roman civil and military system. Further, imperial visits or involvement in British affairs are discussed in detail. These include Claudius' participation in the conquest and his victory celebrations; Hadrian's visit in 122 and the building of his Wall; the building of the Antonine Wall; Severus' expedition, 208-211; the usurpation of Carausius and Allectus; Constantius' recovery of Britain and Pictish campaign; Constantine's proclamation as emperor at York and possible later visits; Constans' expedition in 343; Stilicho's defence measures; and the end of Roman rule. This book offers a narrative history of Roman Britain, with full citation of sources. The analysis of the background and careers of hundreds of individuals sheds light on the way the Roman Empire worked during a period of over 360 years.","authors":["Anthony R.
