{"id":"263304660_Educacao_em_Sistemas_de_Informacao_no_Brasil_Uma_Analise_da_Abordagem_Curricular_em_Instituicoes_de_Ensino_Superior_Brasileiras","abstract":"In Brazil, Bachelor of Information Systems (BIS) courses emerged in the 1980s and have ex-panded considerably since then. Being a relatively recent academic degree in the country, it is necessary to investigate what the structures/curriculums of these courses are, primarily taking into consideration the prescriptions/indications of the scientific communities of the appropriate area and labor market demands. With this in mind, the general objective of this article is to develop an analysis of the curricular approach of BIS courses offered in higher education insti-tutions (HEI) in Brazil, using a sample of 50 BIS courses offered by HEI around the country, whose selection procedure prioritizes courses that are regionally and/or nationally relevant, proven by quality indicators. One of the main findings of this work is that in relation to the the-matic emphases of the various disciplines, the curriculums of the BIS courses in Brazil differ greatly from the guidelines defined by the Brazilian Computing Society. In addition, it is ob-served that little emphasis is given to disciplines related to specific training in the Information Systems (IS) area, which points to a weak identity of these courses in Brazil.","authors":["Joao Porto De Albuquerque","Edmir Parada Vasques","Fernando Coelho Coelho","Rafael Prado Celso"],"meta":["April 2014Revista Brasileira de Informática na Educação 22(01)","DOI:10.5753/RBIE.2014.22.01.79"],"references":["262141101_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_5th_Ed"]}
