{"id":"222497325_All_convex_polyhedra_can_be_clamped_with_parallel_jaw_grippers","abstract":"We study various classes of polyhedra that can be clamped using parallel jaw grippers. We show that all n-vertex convex polyhedra can be clamped regardless of the gripper size and present an O(n + k) time algorithm to compute all positions of a polyhedron that allow a valid clamp where k is the number of antipodal pairs of features. We also observe that all terrain polyhedra and orthogonal polyhedra can be clamped and a valid clamp can be found in linear time. Finally we show that all polyhedra can be clamped with some size of gripper.","authors":["Prosenjit Bose","David Bremner","Godfried Toussaint"],"meta":["September 1996Computational Geometry 6(5):291-302","DOI:10.1016/0925-7721(95)00052-6"],"references":["235687276_Immobilizing_figures_on_the_plane","227016901_Diameter_width_closest_line_pair_and_parametric_searching","226546085_Feasibility_of_design_in_stereolithography","220224254_Feasibility_of_Design_in_Stereolithography","265669370_Computational_Geometry_An_Introduction","265373921_Some_results_on_clamping_a_polygon","256393837_Mechanics","247635452_Stable_prehension_with_a_multi-fingered_hand_extended_abstract","239065705_Design_and_Control_of_an_Articulated_Hand","235160992_Geometric_Transforms_for_Fast_Geometric_Algorithms","227053608_On_the_existence_and_synthesis_of_multifinger_positive_grips","225954036_Efficient_randomized_algorithms_for_some_geometric_optimization_problems","225785868_Computing_convolutions_by_reciprocal_search","225524184_Inner_and_outerj-radii_of_convex_bodies_in_finite-dimensional_normed_spaces","224668922_Reactive_algorithms_for_grasping_using_a_modified_parallel_jaw_gripper","220644155_Clamping_of_polygonal_objects","220068070_Clamping_a_polygon","31773337_Computational_Geometry_in_C_J_O'Rourke","3191598_Computing_the_width_of_a_set","2822799_Reactive_Algorithms_for_Grasping_using_a_modified_parallel_jaw_gripper","2732723_A_Simple_Linear_Algorithm_for_Intersecting_Convex_Polygons"]}
