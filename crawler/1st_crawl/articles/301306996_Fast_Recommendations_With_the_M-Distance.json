{"id":"301306996_Fast_Recommendations_With_the_M-Distance","abstract":"Memory-based recommender systems with users and items typically require space to store the rating information. In item-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms, the feature vector of each item has length , and it takes time to compute the similarity between two items using the Pearson or cosine distances. In this paper, we propose an efficient CF algorithm based on a new measure called the -distance, which is defined as the difference between the average ratings of two items. In the initialization stage, we compute the average ratings of items and store them in two vectors, which requires space. Scanning the rating dataset then takes time. In the online prediction stage, a threshold is employed to identify similar items. To predict ratings, our algorithm requires time compared with the time of the cosine-based NN algorithm. Experiments are undertaken on four well-known datasets, and the proposed $M","authors":["Mei Zheng","Fan Min","Heng-Ru Zhang","Wen-Bin Chen"],"meta":["January 2016IEEE Access 4:1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2549182"],"references":["235357340_Empirical_Analysis_of_Predictive_Algorithm_for_Collaborative_Filtering","221299518_Unifying_user-based_and_item-based_collaborative_filtering_approaches_by_similarity_fusion","221141086_Eigentaste_50_Constant-time_adaptability_in_a_recommender_system_using_item_clustering","221141030_Performance_of_recommender_algorithms_on_top-N_recommendation_tasks","308953917_Amazon_com_recommendations_Item-to-item_collaborative_filtering","282492351_Three-way_recommender_systems_based_on_random_forests","257460037_Bayesian_Citation-KNN_with_distance_weighting","257391708_Recommender_systems_survey","238799778_Recommender_systems_Commun_ACM","224112437_The_Distance-Weighted_k-Nearest-Neighbor_Rule"]}
