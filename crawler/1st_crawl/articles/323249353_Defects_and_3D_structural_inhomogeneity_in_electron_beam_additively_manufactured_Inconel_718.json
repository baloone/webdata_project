{"id":"323249353_Defects_and_3D_structural_inhomogeneity_in_electron_beam_additively_manufactured_Inconel_718","abstract":"Material structure and defects created during additive manufacturing contribute to the wide range of mechanical properties of these parts, limiting their use for critical applications. Three-dimensional characterization of crystallographic, structural, and chemical properties of electron beam melted Inconel 718 from the sub-micron to millimeter scale was performed using the TriBeam tomography system. The relationship of defects to the surrounding microstructure has been studied in detail. Lack of fusion defects created sharp discontinuities in grain morphology that extended several build layers beyond the layer where the defect originated. Nitrides and carbides in the size range of 1.25 μm to 10 μm were observed throughout the volume, with pronounced clustering of the nitrides. Carbides of similar size and distribution measured for industrial-scale samples of 718 demonstrate the similarities between solidification in additive manufacturing and traditional manufacturing processes. Defects created during additive manufacturing cannot be easily remedied via standard post-processing techniques, and will likely diminish the mechanical performance of additively manufactured parts.","authors":["Andrew Polonsky","McLean P.
