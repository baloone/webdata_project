{"id":"281487740_Analysis_of_Hannan_Consistent_Selection_for_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_in_Simultaneous_Move_Games","abstract":"Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has recently been successfully used to create\nstrategies for playing imperfect-information games. Despite its popularity,\nthere are no theoretic results that guarantee its convergence to a well-defined\nsolution, such as Nash equilibrium, in these games. We partially fill this gap\nby analysing MCTS in the class of zero-sum extensive-form games with\nsimultaneous moves but otherwise perfect information. The lack of information\nabout the opponent's concurrent moves already causes that optimal strategies\nmay require randomization. We present theoretic as well as empirical\ninvestigation of the speed and quality of convergence of these algorithms to\nthe Nash equilibria. Primarily, we show that after minor technical\nmodifications, MCTS based on any (approximately) Hannan consistent selection\nfunction always converges to an (approximate) subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.\nWithout these modifications, Hannan consistency is not sufficient to ensure\nsuch convergence and the selection function must satisfy additional properties,\nwhich empirically hold for the most common Hannan consistent algorithms.","authors":["Vojtech Kovarik","Viliam Lisý"],"meta":["January 2020Machine Learning 109(2–3)","DOI:10.1007/s10994-019-05832-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["321878591_Superhuman_AI_for_heads-up_no-limit_poker_Libratus_beats_top_professionals","313630745_The_nonstochastic_multiarmed_bandit_problem","313569257_Regret_minimization_in_games_with_incomplete_information","312157307_DeepStack_Expert-Level_Artificial_Intelligence_in_No-Limit_Poker","299836655_Algorithms_for_Computing_Strategies_in_Two-Player_Simultaneous_Move_Games","298876907_The_nonstochastic_multiarmed_bandit_problem","288490367_Online_Learning_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_with_Adversarially_Chosen_Transition_Probability_Distributions","281530900_Incomplete_information_and_internal_regret_in_prediction_of_individual_sequences","272504031_Online_Monte_Carlo_Counterfactual_Regret_Minimization_for_Search_in_Imperfect_Information_Games","267809496_Comparing_UCT_versus_CFR_in_simultaneous_games","266378318_Using_Double-oracle_Method_and_Serialized_Alpha-Beta_Search_for_Pruning_in_Simultaneous_Move_Games","267089975_Goofspiel_The_Game_of_Pure_Strategy","265016155_Information_capture_and_reuse_strategies_in_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_with_applications_to_games_of_hidden_information","263114776_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_Variants_for_Simultaneous_Move_Games","262288172_Anytime_algorithms_for_multi-agent_visibility-based_pursuit-evasion_games"]}
