{"id":"289302151_Kan_Extensions_of_Institutions","abstract":"Institutions were introduced by Goguen and Burstall [GB84, GB85, GB86, GB92] to formally capture the notion of logical system. Interpreting institutions as functors, and morphisms and representations of institutions as natural transformations, we give elegant proofs for the completeness of the categories of institutions with morphisms and representations, respectively, show that the duality between morphisms and representations of institutions comes from an adjointness between categories of functors, and prove the cocompleteness of the categories of institutions over small signatures with morphisms and representations, respectively.","authors":["G.
