{"id":"331718811_An_Escape_Room_as_a_Simulation_Teaching_Strategy","abstract":"Background\nThis teaching project describes the process of creating, implementing, and appraising the use of escape room concepts within a urosepsis high-fidelity simulation scenario.\n\nMethod\nInstead of a locked room, Breakout EDU locked boxes were incorporated into a clinical simulation. Nursing students applied concepts learned in class and analyzed patient data to obtain clues. These clues helped determine the combination to four locks and progress through the simulation within 60 minutes. After completing the escape room simulation, each group had an opportunity to gather for a team photo, which they posted on social media.\n\nResults\nStudents reported the escape game contributed to their learning and improved their ability to delegate tasks and work as a team. Preliminary observations reveal that “time” may be a significant factor associated with this teaching strategy.\n\nConclusion\nThe concept of an escape room or serious game-based learning was found to be an engaging teaching strategy by faculty and students.","authors":["Neysa Brown","Wendy Darby","Helen Coronel"],"meta":["March 2019Clinical Simulation in Nursing 30(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ecns.2019.02.002"],"references":["323568627_Escape_Room_Recruitment_Event_Description_and_Lessons_Learned","321947390_Educational_Gaming_for_Pharmacy_Students_-_Design_and_Evaluation_of_a_Diabetes-themed_Escape_Room","282999541_INACSL_Standards_of_Best_Practice_for_Simulation_Past_Present_and_Future","325500615_The_Surviving_Sepsis_Campaign_Bundle_2018_Update","324608039_The_Surviving_Sepsis_Campaign_Bundle_2018_update","323391809_Can_You_Escape_Creating_an_Escape_Room_to_Facilitate_Active_Learning","321653253_Using_an_Escape_Room_toolbox_approach_to_enhance_pharmacology_education","320343563_The_Evidence_in_Simulation-Based_Learning_Experiences_in_Nursing_Education_and_Practice_An_Umbrella_Review","305740434_Reporting_Guidelines_for_Health_Care_Simulation_Research","305662109_Reporting_guidelines_for_health_care_simulation_researchExtensions_to_the_CONSORT_and_STROBE_statements","270275080_Game-Based_Teaching_and_Simulation_in_Nursing_and_Health_Care"]}
