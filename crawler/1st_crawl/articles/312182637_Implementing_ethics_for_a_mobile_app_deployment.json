{"id":"312182637_Implementing_ethics_for_a_mobile_app_deployment","abstract":"This paper discusses the ethical dimensions of a research project in which we deployed a personal tracking app on the Apple App Store and collected data from users with whom we had little or no direct contact. We describe the in-app functionality we created for supporting consent and withdrawal, our approach to privacy, our navigation of a formal ethical review, and navigation of the Apple approval process. We highlight two key issues for deployment-based research. Firstly, that it involves addressing multiple, sometimes conflicting ethical principles and guidelines. Secondly, that research ethics are not readily separable from design, but the two are enmeshed. As such, we argue that in-action and situational perspectives on research ethics are relevant to deployment-based research, even where the technology is relatively mundane. We also argue that it is desirable to produce and share relevant design knowledge and embed in-action and situational approaches in design activities.","authors":["John Rooksby","Parvin Asadzadeh","Alistair Morrison","Claire Helen McCallum"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1145/3010915.3010919","Conference: the 28th Australian Conference"],"references":["301935245_The_Ethics_of_Unaware_Participation_in_Public_Interventions","301450613_The_Challenge_of_Technology_Research_in_Sensitive_Settings_Case_Studies_in_'ensitive_HCI'","299911755_Ethical_Challenges_in_Collaborative_Storytelling","297593496_The_mPower_study_Parkinson_disease_mobile_data_collected_using_ResearchKit","283894474_FeedFinder_A_Location-Mapping_Mobile_Application_for_Breastfeeding_Women","281613720_The_Ethical_Implications_of_HCI's_Turn_to_the_Cultural","273089965_Situational_Ethics_Re-thinking_Approaches_to_Formal_Ethics_Requirements_for_Human-Computer_Interaction","266655717_Towards_a_closer_dialogue_between_policy_and_practice_Responsible_design_in_HCI","266654104_An_informed_view_on_consent_for_UbiComp","263506285_Beyond_ethnography_Engagement_and_reciprocity_as_foundations_for_design_research_out_here","262327982_App_Stores_External_Validity_for_Mobile_HCI","261403548_Upright_or_sideways_analysis_of_smartphone_postures_in_the_wild","260567525_A_Large-scale_assessment_of_mobile_notifications","242020111_Categorised_Ethical_Guidelines_for_Large_Scale_Mobile_HCI","239761343_A_hybrid_mass_participation_approach_to_mobile_software_trials","221515720_Ethics_logs_and_videotape_ethics_in_large_scale_user_trials_and_user_generated_content","221270908_100000000_Taps_Analysis_and_Improvement_of_Touch_Performance_in_the_Large","221270571_Falling_asleep_with_Angry_Birds_Facebook_and_Kindle_A_large_scale_study_on_mobile_application_usage","221015852_Further_into_the_Wild_Running_Worldwide_Trials_of_Mobile_Systems","220586489_A_Comparison_of_Distribution_Channels_for_Large-Scale_Deployments_of_iOS_Applications","311747291_In-Action_Ethics_Table_1","308043045_Investigating_how_users_engage_with_a_pedometer_app","303482301_Probabilistic_Formal_Analysis_of_App_Usage_to_Inform_Redesign","301935247_Five_Provocations_for_Ethical_HCI_Research","301932925_Personal_Tracking_of_Screen_Time_on_Digital_Devices","301705124_Deep_cover_HCI_The_ethics_of_covert_research","300725593_Pass_the_Ball","300725483_Deep_Cover_HCI","282178075_Improving_consent_in_large_scale_mobile_HCI_through_personalised_representations_of_data","262162267_Motivating_contribution_in_a_participatory_sensing_system_via_quid-pro-quo","250694989_The_diversity_and_ethics_of_HCI","248504444_Sketching_Designing_User_Experiences_Getting_the_Design_Right_and_the_Right_Design","239600571_The_reflective_practitioner_how_professionals_think_in_action_basic_books_inc","234779865_Human_values_ethics_and_design","229638868_Rethinking_Research_Ethics_in_Contemporary_Applied_Linguistics_The_Tension_Between_Macroethical_and_Microethical_Perspectives_in_Situated_Research","221332030_Dilemmas_in_situating_participation_in_rural_ways_of_saying","213881465_Managing_the_Development_of_Large_Software_Systems"]}
