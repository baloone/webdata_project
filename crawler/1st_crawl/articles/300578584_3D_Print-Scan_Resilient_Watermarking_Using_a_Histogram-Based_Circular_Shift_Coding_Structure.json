{"id":"300578584_3D_Print-Scan_Resilient_Watermarking_Using_a_Histogram-Based_Circular_Shift_Coding_Structure","abstract":"3D printing content is a new form of content being distributed in digital as well as analog domains. Therefore, its security is the biggest technical challenge of the content distribution service. In this paper, we analyze the 3D print-scan process, and we organize possible distortions according to the processes with respect to 3D mesh watermarking. Based on the analysis, we propose a circular shift coding structure for the 3D model. When the rotating disks of the coding structure are aligned in parallel to the layers of the 3D printing, the structure preserves a statistical feature of each disk from the layer dividing process. Based on the circular shift coding structure, we achieve a 3D print-scan resilient watermarking scheme. In experimental tests, the proposed scheme is robust against such signal processing, and cropping attacks. Furthermore, the embedded information is not lost after 3D print-scan process.","authors":["Jong-Uk Hou","Do-Gon Kim","Sunghee Choi","Heung-Kyu Lee"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1145/2756601.2756607","Conference: the 3rd ACM Workshop"],"references":["260299824_Spectral_Watermarking_for_Parameterized_Surfaces","234047753_Optimized_3D_Watermarking_for_Minimal_Surface_Distortion","227611629_METRO_Measuring_error_on_simplified_surfaces","224354956_A_Comprehensive_Survey_on_Three-Dimensional_Mesh_Watermarking","224168328_Roughness-Adaptive_3-D_Watermarking_Based_on_Masking_Effect_of_Surface_Roughness","221571429_Watermaking_Three-Dimensional_Polygonal_Models","221326514_A_Benchmark_for_3D_Mesh_Watermarking","50895008_Watermarking_Is_Not_Cryptography","3319967_An_Oblivious_Watermarking_for_3-D_Polygonal_Meshes_Using_Distribution_of_Vertex_Norms","3215163_Napster_A_Walking_Copyright_Infringement","286680169_Extracting_Watermark_from_3D_Prints","229393795_Surface_roughness_prediction_using_measured_data_and_interpolation_in_layered_manufacturing","220250946_Robust_and_blind_mesh_watermarking_based_on_volume_moments","220093842_The_Numerical_Tours_of_Signal_Processing","46483226_The_Numerical_Tours_of_Signal_Processing_-_Advanced_Computational_Signal_and_Image_Processing"]}
