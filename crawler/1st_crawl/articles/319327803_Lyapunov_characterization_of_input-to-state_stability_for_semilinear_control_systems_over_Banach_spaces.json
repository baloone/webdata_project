{"id":"319327803_Lyapunov_characterization_of_input-to-state_stability_for_semilinear_control_systems_over_Banach_spaces","abstract":"We prove that input-to-state stability (ISS) of nonlinear systems over Banach spaces is equivalent to existence of a coercive Lipschitz continuous ISS Lyapunov function for this system. For linear infinite-dimensional systems, we show that ISS is equivalent to existence of a non-coercive ISS Lyapunov function and provide two simpler constructions of coercive and non-coercive ISS Lyapunov functions for input-to-state stable linear systems.","authors":["Andrii Mironchenko","Fabian Wirth"],"meta":["August 2017Systems & Control Letters 119","DOI:10.1016/j.sysconle.2018.07.007","Project: Input-to-state stability and stabilization of distributed parameter systems"],"references":["313157552_Characterizations_of_Input-to-State_Stability_for_Infinite-Dimensional_Systems","311769685_Non-coercive_Lyapunov_functions_for_infinite-dimensional_systems","304411215_A_note_on_input-to-state_stability_of_linear_and_bilinear_infinite-dimensional_systems","291554326_Dissipation_inequalities_for_the_analysis_of_a_class_of_PDEs","266856548_Construction_of_Lyapunov_Functions_for_Interconnected_Parabolic_Systems_An_iISS_Approach","308721001_Global_converse_Lyapunov_theorems_for_infinite-dimensional_systems","301897781_ISS_In_Different_Norms_For_1-D_Parabolic_Pdes_With_Boundary_Disturbances","284358903_Local_input-to-state_stability_Characterizations_and_counterexamples","277334802_ISS_with_Respect_to_Boundary_Disturbances_for_1-D_Parabolic_PDEs","267071257_Stability_and_Stabilization_of_Nonlinear_Systems"]}
