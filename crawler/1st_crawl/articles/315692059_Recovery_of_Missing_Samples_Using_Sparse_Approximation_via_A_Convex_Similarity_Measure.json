{"id":"315692059_Recovery_of_Missing_Samples_Using_Sparse_Approximation_via_A_Convex_Similarity_Measure","abstract":"In this paper we study the missing sample recovery problem using methods based on sparse approximation. In this regard, we investigate the algorithms used for solving the inverse problem associated with the restoration of missed samples of image signal. This problem is also known as inpainting in the context of image processing and for this purpose we suggest an iterative sparse recovery algorithm based on constrained l1-norm minimization with a new fidelity metric. The incorporated metric called Convex SIMilarity (CSIM) index is a simplified version of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index which is convex and error-sensitive. The optimization problem incorporating this criterion is then solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method for missing sample recovery of 1D patch vectors and inpainting of 2D image signals.","authors":["Amirhossein Javaheri","Hadi Zayyani","Farokh Marvasti"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1109/SAMPTA.2017.8024455","Conference: SAMPTA 2017"],"references":["312912430_An_Iterative_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Recovery_of_Missing_Image_Samples_Using_a_New_Similarity_Index","269588939_Image_inpainting_based_on_sparse_representations_with_a_perceptual_metric","264795264_A_Universal_Variational_Framework_for_Sparsity-Based_Image_Inpainting","260722824_Image_Inpainting_Overview_and_Recent_Advances","259874909_On_Image_Block_Loss_Restoration_Using_the_Sparsity_Pattern_as_Side_Information","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","276426090_A_Survey_of_Sparse_Representation_Algorithms_and_Applications","265065417_Applied_Missing_Data_Analysis","257549153_An_efficient_augmented_Lagrangian_method_with_applications_to_total_variation_minimization","252895629_Constraint_Optimization_and_Lagrange_Multiplier_Methods"]}
