{"id":"306300767_Survey_on_Data_Integrity_in_Cloud","abstract":"In recent years cloud computing is getting more and more attention every day. While outsourcing the hardware and software resources, still being able to manage them remotely with benefits like high computing power, competitiveness, cost efficiency, scalability, flexibility, accessibility and availability are revolutionary. For all of its advantages, on the other hand, nothing interesting is ever completely one-sided. Security and integrity of the data which is stored in untrustworthy server is critically important and raises concerns about it. The data can be modified, removed, corrupted or even stolen since it is in the remote server. These kinds of malicious activities can be done either by untrusted server or unauthorized user(s). Therefore, various integrity checking methods have been offered for cloud computing systems. This survey aims to analyze and compare different researches about data integrity proofs for these systems.","authors":["Kamile Nur Sevis","Ensar Seker"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1109/CSCloud.2016.35","Conference: 2016 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing (CSCloud)At: IEEE","Project: Cloud Computing"],"references":["287997767_The_Gap_between_Cloud_Computing_Technology_and_the_Audit_and_Information_Security_Supporting_Standards_and_Regulations","221609532_Dynamic_Provable_Data_Possession","312443004_Cloud_computing_issues_challenges","286618485_Data_integrity_proofs_in_cloud_storage","284979143_Provable_data_possession_at_untrusted_stores","279815211_Cloud_computing_models","269657951_The_Challenge_of_the_Computer_Utility","261501078_Integrity_checking_for_cloud_environment_using_encryption_algorithm","261336742_A_dynamic_Proof_of_Retrievability_PoR_scheme_with_Ologn_complexity","261335341_Integrity_Verification_of_Multiple_Data_Copies_over_Untrusted_Cloud_Servers"]}
