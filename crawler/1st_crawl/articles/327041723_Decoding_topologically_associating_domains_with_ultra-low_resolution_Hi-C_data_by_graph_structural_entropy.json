{"id":"327041723_Decoding_topologically_associating_domains_with_ultra-low_resolution_Hi-C_data_by_graph_structural_entropy","abstract":"Submegabase-size topologically associating domains (TAD) have been observed in high-throughput chromatin interaction data (Hi-C). However, accurate detection of TADs depends on ultra-deep sequencing and sophisticated normalization procedures. Here we propose a fast and normalization-free method to decode the domains of chromosomes (deDoc) that utilizes structural information theory. By treating Hi-C contact matrix as a representation of a graph, deDoc partitions the graph into segments with minimal structural entropy. We show that structural entropy can also be used to determine the proper bin size of the Hi-C data. By applying deDoc to pooled Hi-C data from 10 single cells, we detect megabase-size TAD-like domains. This result implies that the modular structure of the genome spatial organization may be fundamental to even a small cohort of single cells. Our algorithms may facilitate systematic investigations of chromosomal domains on a larger scale than hitherto have been possible.","authors":["Angsheng Li","Xianchen Yin","Bingxiang Xu","Danyang Wang"],"meta":["August 2018Nature Communications 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-018-05691-7","Project: 3D Genome"],"references":["345741647_Detecting_hierarchical_3-D_genome_domain_reconfiguration_with_network_modularity","344710707_Rich_chromatin_structure_prediction_from_Hi-C_data","319715060_Identifying_topologically_associating_domains_and_subdomains_by_Gaussian_Mixture_model_And_Proportion_test","319306593_HiTAD_detecting_the_structural_and_functional_hierarchies_of_topologically_associating_domains_from_chromatin_interactions","318708109_MrTADFinder_A_network_modularity_based_approach_to_identify_topologically_associating_domains_in_multiple_resolutions","326048178_Rich_Chromatin_Structure_Prediction_from_Hi-C_Data","320235157_Computational_characterization_of_chromatin_domain_boundary-associated_genomic_elements","319169207_Evolutionarily_Conserved_Principles_Predict_3D_Chromatin_Organization","318985058_The_Three-Dimensional_Organization_of_Mammalian_Genomes","317571480_Comparison_of_computational_methods_for_Hi-C_data_analysis","315698713_Single-nucleus_Hi-C_reveals_unique_chromatin_reorganization_at_oocyte-to-zygote_transition","313112723_Massively_multiplex_single-cell_Hi-C","313016751_IC-Finder_Inferring_robustly_the_hierarchical_organization_of_chromatin_folding","312354941_CTCF-mediated_topological_boundaries_during_development_foster_appropriate_gene_regulation","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks"]}
