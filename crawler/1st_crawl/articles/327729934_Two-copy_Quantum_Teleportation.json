{"id":"327729934_Two-copy_Quantum_Teleportation","abstract":"We investigate two-copy scenario of quantum teleportation based on Bell measurements. The detailed protocol is presented and the general expression of the corresponding optimal teleportation fidelity is derived, which is given by the two-copy fully entangled fraction that is invariant under local unitary transformations. We prove that under a specific case of the protocol, which is significant for improving the optimal fidelity, the set of states with their two-copy fully entangled fractions bounded by a threshold value that required for useful two-copy teleportation is convex and compact. Hence the witness operators exist to separate states that are useful for two-copy teleportation from the rest ones. Moreover, we show that the optimal fidelity of two-copy teleportation surpasses that of the original one copy teleportation.","authors":["Quan Quan","Ming-Jing Zhao","Shao-Ming Fei","Heng Fan"],"meta":["September 2018Scientific Reports 8(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31918-0"],"references":["224905152_Complete_Entanglement_Witness_for_Quantum_Teleportation","221745813_Entanglement_Witness_Operator_for_Quantum_Teleportation","305228891_All_Entangled_States_can_Demonstrate_Nonclassical_Teleportation","243651208_Geometrical_Functional_Analysis_and_Its_Applications","243473720_Inseparable_Two_Spin_12_Density_Matrices_Can_Be_Distilled_to_a_Singlet_Form","235731301_Quantum_Information_An_Introduction_to_Basic_Theoretical_Concepts_and_Experiments","235459493_General_teleportation_channel_singlet_fraction_and_quasidistillation","230630412_An_Introductionto_the_Conjugate_Gradient_Method_Without_the_Agonizing_Pain","222676638_The_fully_entangled_fraction_as_an_inclusive_measure_of_entanglement_applications","222674624_Bell_measurements_and_observables"]}
