{"id":"272752612_Modeling_the_Aerodynamic_Lift_Produced_by_Oscillating_Airfoils_at_Low_Reynolds_Number","abstract":"For present study, setting Strouhal Number (St) as control parameter,\nnumerical simulations for flow past oscillating NACA-0012 airfoil at 1,000\nReynolds Numbers (Re) are performed. Temporal profiles of unsteady forces; lift\nand thrust, and their spectral analysis clearly indicate the solution to be a\nperiod-1 attractor for low Strouhal numbers. This study reveals that\naerodynamic forces produced by plunging airfoil are independent of initial\nkinematic conditions of airfoil that proves the existence of limit cycle.\nFrequencies present in the oscillating lift force are composed of fundamental\n(fs), even and odd harmonics (3fs) at higher Strouhal numbers. Using numerical\nsimulations, shedding frequencies (f_s) were observed to be nearly equal to the\nexcitation frequencies in all the cases. Unsteady lift force generated due to\nthe plunging airfoil is modeled by modified van der Pol oscillator. Using\nmethod of multiple scales and spectral analysis of steady-state CFD solutions,\nfrequencies and damping terms in the van der Pol oscillator model are\nestimated. We prove the applicability of this model to all planar motions of\nairfoil; plunging, pitching and flapping. An important aspect of\ncurrently-proposed model is capturing the time-averaged value of aerodynamic\nlift coefficient.","authors":["Muhammad Saif Ullah Khalid","Akhtar Imran"],"meta":["December 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["312234881_Turbulence_and_the_dynamics_of_coherent_structures_I_Coherent_structures","270452368_Analysis_of_Strouhal_Number_Based_Equivalence_of_Pitching_and_Plunging_Airfoils_and_Wake_Deflection","265539229_Development_of_Reduced-Order_Models_for_Lift_and_Drag_on_Oscillating_Cylinders_with_Higher-Order_Spectral_Moments","265114989_Parallel_Simulation_Reduced-Order_Modeling_and_Feedback_Control_of_Vortex_Shedding_using_Fluidic_Actuators","285260593_Introduction","285169487_Ein_Beitrag_zur_Erklaerung_des_Segelfluges","285119994_Die_Gesetze_des_Luftwiderstandes","277808544_Parameter_Identification_of_Nonlinear_Systems_Using_Perturbation_Methods_and_Higher-Order_Statistics","265950773_Applied_dynamics_With_applications_to_multibody_and_mechatronic_systems","259177349_Experimental_and_Numerical_Investigations_on_the_Asymmetric_Wake_Vortex_Structures_of_an_Oscillating_Airfoil"]}
