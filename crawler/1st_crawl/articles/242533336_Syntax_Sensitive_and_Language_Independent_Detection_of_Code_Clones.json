{"id":"242533336_Syntax_Sensitive_and_Language_Independent_Detection_of_Code_Clones","abstract":"This paper proposes a new technique to detect code clones from the lexical and syntactic point of view, which is based on PALEX source code representation. The PALEX code contains the recorded parsing actions and also lexical formatting information including white spaces and comments. We can record a list of parsing actions (shift, reduce, and reading a token) during a compiling process after a compiler finishes analyzing the source code. The proposed technique has advantages for syntax sensitive approach and language independency.","authors":["Kazuaki Maeda"],"meta":["December 2009"],"references":["224500195_Exploiting_Quantized_Channel_Norm_Feedback_Through_Conditional_Statistics_in_Arbitrarily_Correlated_MIMO_Systems","221200159_Clone_Detection_via_Structural_Abstraction","243767016_Introduction_to_Space-Time_Wireless_Communications_M","243673160_Multi-Carrier_Digital_Communications-Theory_and_Applications_of_OFDM","236157555_Wireless_Communications_First_Edition","224641731_Combining_Short-Term_and_Long-Term_Channel_State_Information_Over_Correlated_Mimo_Channels","224222665_Evaluation_of_low_rate_channel_feedback_schemes_for_MIMO_systems","27631352_Simple_transmit_diversity_technique_for_wireless_communications","4104600_Multipath_signal_effect_on_the_capacity_of_MIMO_MIMO-OFDM_and_spread_MIMO-OFDM","3906368_Space-time_processing_with_channel_knowledge_at_the_transmitter","3321333_Increasing_data_rate_over_wireless_channels","3234063_Efficient_use_of_side_information_in_multiple-antenna_data_transmission_over_fading_channels","3161153_On_the_Design_of_MIMO_Block-Fading_Channels_With_Feedback-Link_Capacity_Constraint","3155569_Limited_Feedback_Diversity_Techniques_for_Correlated_Channels","3085845_Feedback_rate-capacity_loss_tradeoff_for_limited_feedback_MIMO_systems","3084837_Grassmannian_beamforming_for_multiple-input_multiple-output_wireless_systems","2986262_An_Overview_of_MIMO_Communications-A_Key_to_Gigabit_Wireless","2852741_On_Beamforming_with_Finite_Rate_Feedback_in_Multiple_Antenna_Systems"]}
