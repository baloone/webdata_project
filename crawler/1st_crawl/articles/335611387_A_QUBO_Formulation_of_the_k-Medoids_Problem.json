{"id":"335611387_A_QUBO_Formulation_of_the_k-Medoids_Problem","abstract":"We are concerned with k-medoids clustering and propose a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of the problem of identifying k medoids among n data points without having to cluster the data. Given our QUBO formulation of this NP-hard problem, it should be possible to solve it on adiabatic quantum computers.","authors":["Christian Bauckhage","N Piatkowski","Rafet Sifa","Dirk Hecker"],"meta":["September 2019","Conference: LWDA/KDML 2019At: Berlin","Project: Resource-aware Learning"],"references":["329590512_A_Universal_Probe_Set_for_Targeted_Sequencing_of_353_Nuclear_Genes_from_Any_Flowering_Plant_Designed_Using_k-Medoids_Clustering","327567335_Reactivity_of_Amorphous_Carbon_Surfaces_Rationalizing_the_Role_of_Structural_Motifs_in_Functionalization_Using_Machine_Learning","327446499_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computing_for_Kernel_k_2_Means_Clustering","325258549_k-Means_and_Fisher's_Analysis_of_Variance","317673682_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computing_for_Binary_Clustering","317310273_QUBO_formulations_for_the_graph_isomorphism_problem_and_related_problems","324286003_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","313049131_Techniques_for_nonlinear_least_squares_and_robust_regression","310403387_A_K-means_clustering_algorithm","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM"]}
