{"id":"286894661_An_iterative_methodology_for_mapping_mixed_reality_technologies_to_AEC_operations","abstract":"Mixed Reality (MR) technology can create an environment where objects from the digital and real worlds can be combined together in a real time manner. The practical contribution of this paper is a structured and iterative methodology developed for mapping appropriate Mixed Reality technology to a specific architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) task. To increase the likelihood of success in technology transfer, this methodology for developing user-centered, performance enhancing MR-based systems is formulated, where AEC tasks are generically analyzed and categorized according to common functional features, which could be mapped to a collection of suitable or required MR-related technology strategies. Also, a technology selection process is identified to choose appropriate technology characteristics including information representations, interaction methods and, tracking technology for a specific task category. Such a thorough mapping methodology can be used to guide new MR-based system design as well as to help evaluate existing systems.","authors":["Phillip Sherwood Dunston","Xiangyu Wang"],"meta":["February 2011Electronic Journal of Information Technology in Construction 16:509-528"],"references":["268592910_System_Evaluation_of_a_Mixed_Reality-Based_Collaborative_Prototype_for_Mechanical_Design_Review_Collaboration","244450949_A_survey_of_tracking_technologies_for_virtual_en-vironments","242415577_A_survey_of_tracking_technology_for_virtual_environments","242085910_Camera_constraint_on_multi-range_calibration_of_augmented_reality_systems_for_construction_sites","222335055_Compatibility_issues_in_Augmented_Reality_systems_for_AEC_An_experimental_prototype_study","216814040_Mixed_Reality_benefits_for_design_perception","3624354_The_virtual_annotation_system","2826659_Augmented_Reality_in_Architectural_Construction_Inspection_and_Renovation","2560992_Categorizing_Augmented_Reality_Systems","2440732_A_Taxonomy_of_Real_and_Virtual_World_Display_Integration","312975694_Human_stereopsis_fusion_and_stereoscopic_virtual_environments","297228975_GROUPWARE_-_SOME_ISSUES_AND_EXPERIENCES","292691109_Look_beneath_the_surface","269159899_Augmented_Reality_An_Application_for_Architecture","268597854_Issues_in_Mixed_Reality-Based_Design_and_Collaboration_Environments","268596548_Potential_of_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_for_Infrastructure_Field_Tasks","257371412_Evaluation_of_Augmented_Reality_in_steel_column_inspection","255623525_Automated_Generation_of_Operations_Level_Construction_Animations_in_Outdoor_Augmented_Reality","252541200_Self-tracking_of_human_motion_for_virtual_reality_systems","245292178_Urban_Planning_Using_Augmented_Reality","245282503_Potential_of_Augmented_Reality_as_an_Assistant_Viewer_for_Computer-Aided_Drawing","242637833_Design_hints_for_spatial_input","232517768_Cognitive_issues_in_virtual_reality","223542015_Identification_of_application_areas_for_Augmented_Reality_in_industrial_construction_based_on_technology_suitability","221516907_Multiagent_Model_of_Dynamic_Design_Visualization_as_an_Emergent_Behavior_of_Active_Design_Agents","221516019_Virtual_Reality_on_a_WIM_Interactive_Worlds_in_Miniature","220090263_A_Two-Handed_Interface_for_Object_Manipulation_in_Virtual_Environments","200086043_Usability_Inspection_Methods","27238995_Applications_of_mixed_reality_in_architecture_engineering_and_construction_Specification_prototype_and_evaluation","3824586_Scene_Augmentation_via_the_Fusion_of_Industrial_Drawings_and_Uncalibrated_Images_with_a_View_to_Marker-Less_Calibration","2639465_A_Taxonomy_of_Usability_Characteristics_in_Virtual_Environments","2310038_Usability_Evaluation_Techniques_A_Novel_Method_For_Assessing_The_Usability_Of_An_Immersive_Medical_Visualization_Ve"]}
