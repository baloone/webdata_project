{"id":"236837518_Single_Image_Dehazing_by_Multi-Scale_Fusion","abstract":"Haze is an atmospheric phenomenon that significantly degrades the visibility of outdoor scenes. This is mainly due to the atmosphere particles that absorb and scatter the light. This paper introduces a novel single image approach that enhances the visibility of such degraded images. Our method is a fusion-based strategy that derives from the original hazy image two inputs by applying a white balance and a contrast enhancing procedure. To blend effectively the information of the derived inputs in order to preserve the regions with good visibility, we filter their important features by computing three measures (weight maps): luminance, chromaticity and saliency. To minimize artifacts introduced by the weight maps, our approach is designed in a multi-scale fashion, using a Laplacian pyramid representation. We are the first to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of a fusion-based technique for dehazing based on a single degraded image. The method performs in a per-pixel fashion, which is straightforward to implement. The experimental results demonstrate that the method yields comparative and even better results than the more complex state-of-the-art techniques having the advantage to be appropriate for real-time applications.","authors":["Ancuti Codruta","Cosmin Ancuti"],"meta":["May 2013IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 22(8)","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2013.2262284","SourcePubMed"],"references":["248977649_Haze_removal_for_high-resolution_satelite_data_A_case_study","224622203_Color_Constancy_based_on_the_Grey-Edge_Hypothesis","224136067_Factorizing_Scene_Albedo_and_Depth_from_a_Single_Foggy_Image","224130020_Color_Constancy_Using_Natural_Image_Statistics_and_Scene_Semantics","223795843_An_improved_dark-object_subtraction_technique_for_atmospheric_scattering_correction_of_multispectral_data","221364396_Polarization_Beneficial_for_visibility_enhancement","221363624_Towards_Fog-Free_In-Vehicle_Vision_Systems_through_Contrast_Restoration","221362812_Visibility_in_bad_weather_from_a_single_image","221110862_Fast_Visibility_Restoration_from_a_Single_Color_or_Gray_Level_Image","220505820_Cross_Dissolve_Without_Cross_Fade_Preserving_Contrast_Color_and_Salience_in_Image_Compositing","220184290_Edge-preserving_decompositions_for_multi-scale_tone_and_detail_manipulation","220182411_Single_Image_Haze_Removal_Using_Dark_Channel_Prior","46158497_Single_Image_Haze_Removal_Using_Dark_Channel_Prior","26518907_Blind_Contrast_Enhancement_Assessment_by_Gradient_Ratioing_at_Visible_Edges","17641495_Lightness_and_Retinex_Theory","11001500_Estimating_the_Scene_Illumination_Chromaticity_by_Using_a_Neural_Network","6055124_Edge-Based_Color_Constancy","5764820_A_Closed-Form_Solution_to_Natural_Image_Matting","3596479_Enhanced_image_capture_through_fusion","313571339_Enhanced_image_capture_through_fusion","312816972_Haze_removal_and_data_calibration_for_high-resolution_satellite_data","312604690_A_spatial_processor_model_for_object_color_perception","311467832_'Interactive_de_weathering_of_an_image_using_physical_models'","286980217_Frequency-tuned_salient_region_detection","284257785_Lightness_and_retinex_theory","259942105_Optics_of_the_Atmosphere_-_Scattering_by_Molecules_and_Particles","258887907_Optics_of_the_Atmosphere_Scattering_by_Molecules_and_Particles","257672344_Bayesian_Defogging","248069564_Therie_der_horizontalen_sichtweite","247936157_Image_Fusion_Theories_Techniques_and_Applications","234794112_Deep_Photo_Model-Based_Photograph_Enhancement_and_Viewing","229805949_Exposure_Fusion_A_Simple_and_Practical_Alternative_to_High_Dynamic_Range_Photography","228732932_Interactive_Deweathering_of_an_image_using_physical_models","224733267_The_Laplacian_Pyramid_as_a_Compact_Image_Code","224200195_Effective_Single_Image_Dehazing_by_Fusion","224114750_Color_image_dehazing_using_the_near-infrared","223026917_An_image_transform_to_characterize_and_compensate_for_spatial_variations_in_thin_cloud_contamination_of_Landsat_images","222864111_Modeling_Visual_Attention_via_Selective_Tuning","222755643_Buchsbaum_G_A_spatial_processor_model_for_object_colour_perception_Journal_of_the_Franklin_Institute_3101_1-26","221573063_Contrast-based_image_attention_analysis_by_using_fuzzy_growing","221502067_Shades_of_Gray_and_Colour_Constancy","220183775_Poisson_image_editing","200026025_The_Art_and_Science_of_Digital_Compositing","37468806_Frequency-tuned_Salient_Region_Detection","23807444_Skyless_Polarimetric_calibration_and_visibility_enhancement","10915608_Polarization-Based_Vision_Through_Haze","6211249_Regularized_Image_Recovery_in_Scattering_Media","4246249_Blind_Haze_Separation","3854198_Chromatic_framework_for_vision_in_bad_weather","3816607_Vision_in_bad_weather","3192913_A_Model_of_Saliency-based_Visual_Attention_for_Rapid_Scene_Analysis","2941744_Interactive_Digital_Photomontage","3193559_Contrast_restoration_of_weather_degraded_images"]}
