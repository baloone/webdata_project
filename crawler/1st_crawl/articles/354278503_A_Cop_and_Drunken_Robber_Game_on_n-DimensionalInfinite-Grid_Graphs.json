{"id":"354278503_A_Cop_and_Drunken_Robber_Game_on_n-DimensionalInfinite-Grid_Graphs","abstract":"A Cop and Drunken Robber (CDR) game is one variation of a famous combinatorial game, called Cops and Robbers, which has been extensively studied and applied in the area of theoretical and computer science as demonstrated by several conferences and publications. In this paper, for a natural number n, we present two strategies for a single cop to chase a drunken robber on n-dimensional infinite-grid graphs. Both strategies show that if the initial distance between the cop and the drunken robber is s, then the expected capture time is s+o(s).","authors":["Nuttanon Songsuwan","Thiradet Jiarasuksakun","Anuwat Tangthanawatsakul","Pawaton Kaemawichanurat"],"meta":["August 2021","DOI:10.3390/math9172107"],"references":["321663845_Path_planning_in_polygonal_domains_for_robots_with_limited_turning_abilities","278048085_Simultaneously_Moving_Cops_and_Robbers","353084472_On_the_cop_number_of_toroidal_graphs","326744488_Cops_and_Robbers_on_intersection_graphs","316155809_The_game_of_Cops_and_Robber_on_circulant_graphs","313565837_Random_Walks_and_Electric_Networks","298407140_Catching_the_Drunk_Robber_on_a_Graph","284123673_A_collection_of_results_concerning_electric_resistance_and_simple_random_walk_on_distance-regular_graphs","265894791_Probability_Theory_and_Examples","265817899_Combinatorics_A_guided_tour","228768181_Search_and_Pursuit-evasion_in_Mobile_Robotics","265530313_Generalized_hockey_stick_identities_and_N-dimensional_blockwalking","258140860_Capturing_an_evader_in_polygonal_environments_with_obstacles_The_full_visibility_case","231902986_Random_walk_and_electric_currents_in_networks","226386991_Random_walks_and_the_effective_resistance_of_networks"]}
