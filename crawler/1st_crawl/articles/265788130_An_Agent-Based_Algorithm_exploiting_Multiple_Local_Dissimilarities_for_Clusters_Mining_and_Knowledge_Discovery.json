{"id":"265788130_An_Agent-Based_Algorithm_exploiting_Multiple_Local_Dissimilarities_for_Clusters_Mining_and_Knowledge_Discovery","abstract":"We propose a multi-agent algorithm able to automatically discover relevant\nregularities in a given dataset, determining at the same time the set of\nconfigurations of the adopted parametric dissimilarity measure yielding compact\nand separated clusters. Each agent operates independently by performing a\nMarkovian random walk on a suitable weighted graph representation of the input\ndataset. Such a weighted graph representation is induced by the specific\nparameter configuration of the dissimilarity measure adopted by the agent,\nwhich searches and takes decisions autonomously for one cluster at a time.\nResults show that the algorithm is able to discover parameter configurations\nthat yield a consistent and interpretable collection of clusters. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that our algorithm shows comparable performances with other similar\nstate-of-the-art algorithms when facing specific clustering problems.","authors":["Filippo Maria Bianchi","Enrico Maiorino","Lorenzo Livi","Antonello Rizzi"],"meta":["March 2017Soft Computing","DOI:10.1007/s00500-015-1876-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["271589256_Two_density-based_k-means_initialization_algorithms_for_non-metric_data_clustering","270458843_A_theoretical_formalism_for_analyzing_agent-based_models","321598941_Principles_of_Data_Mining_and_Knowledge_Discovery_First_European_Symposium_PKDD_'97_Trondheim_Norway_June_24-27_1997_Proceedings","309108677_Calculation_of_equations_of_state_by_fast_computing_machines","303206384_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","277577129_Granular_modeling_and_computing_approaches_for_intelligent_analysis_of_non-geometric_data","276944007_Clustering_high-dimensional_data","275147921_Nonlinear_multicriteria_clustering_based_on_multiple_dissimilarity_matrices","272825857_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository","267983240_Metric_and_non-metric_proximity_transformations_at_linear_costs"]}
