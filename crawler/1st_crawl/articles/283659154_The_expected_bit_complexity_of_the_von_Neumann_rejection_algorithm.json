{"id":"283659154_The_expected_bit_complexity_of_the_von_Neumann_rejection_algorithm","abstract":"In 1952, von Neumann introduced the rejection method for random variate\ngeneration. We revisit this algorithm when we have a source of perfect bits at\nour disposal. In this random bit model, there are universal lower bounds for\ngenerating a random variate with a given density to within an accuracy\n$\\epsilon$ derived by Knuth and Yao, and refined by the authors. In general,\nvon Neumann's method fails in this model. We propose a modification that\ninsures proper behavior for all Riemann integrable densities on compact sets,\nand show that the expected number of random bits needed behaves optimally with\nrespect to its dependence on $\\epsilon$.","authors":["Luc Devroye","Claude Gravel"],"meta":["May 2017Statistics and Computing 27(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11222-016-9648-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["316807045_Non-Uniform_Random_Variate_Generation","285547315_Exact_Classical_Simulation_of_the_Quantum-Mechanical_GHZ_Distribution","274891554_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_New-York","272195139_Sampling_with_arbitrary_precision","265563854_Mass_transportation_problems_Vol_1_Theory_Vol_2_Applications","251760679_On_constrained_transportation_problems","242963423_Some_remarks_on_the_dimension_and_entropy_of_random_variables","239536213_Foundations_Of_Multidimensional_And_Metric_Data_Structures","235982461_Sampling_Exactly_from_the_Normal_Distribution","228057919_Various_techniques_used_in_connection_with_random_digits","220681032_Interval_algorithm_for_random_number_generation","228057822_The_Complexity_of_Nonuniform_Random_Number_Generation","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","225304570_Non-Uniform_Random_Variate_Generation","220022168_On_the_dimension_and_entropy_of_probability_distributions"]}
