{"id":"228378134_Some_stability_results_for_two_hybrid_fixed_point_iterative_algorithms_in_normed_linear_space","abstract":"In this paper, we prove some stability results for two newly introduced hybrid fixed point iterative algorithms of Kirk-Ishikawa and Kirk-Mann Type in normed linear space using a certain contractive condition. Our results generalize, extend and improve some of the results of Harder and Hicks [11], Rhoades [29,30], Osilike [26], Berinde [2,3] as well as the recent results of the author [12,23,24,25].","authors":["M.
