{"id":"336890106_Geometry_description_and_mesh_construction_from_medical_imaging","abstract":"We present a new method for defining and meshing patient-specific domains from medical images. Our approach is based on an atlas image segmentation technique, and relies on the modular registration algorithm of S. Bertoluzza et al. [25]. The mesh of the patient-specific domain is generated by deforming the corresponding mesh on an a priori segmented and meshed reference image (the atlas). Our method aims at automating the process at the interface of medical imaging and numerical simulation, thus reducing the computational cost in those situations where simulations have to be managed on numerous medical images of similar patients.","authors":["Michele Giuliano Carlino","Philippe Ricka","Minh Phan","Silvia Bertoluzza"],"meta":["January 2019ESAIM Proceedings and Surveys 67","DOI:10.1051/proc/202067010","Project: European project CE ERC-2015-AdG \"CHANGE - New CHallenges for (adaptive) PDE solvers: the interplay of ANalysis and GEometry\" Grant Agreement n. 694515"],"references":["318504356_A_New_Construction_of_Boundary_Interpolating_Wavelets_for_Fourth_Order_Problems","318185042_A_New_Class_of_Wavelet-Based_Metrics_for_Image_Similarity_Assessment","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","299711869_A_Modular_Registration_Algorithm_for_Medical_Images","291154059_Principal_warps_Thin-plate_splines_and_the_decomposition_of_deformations","285906939_Numerical_optimization","284772993_On_a_family_of_function_spaces_Imbedding_and_extension_theorems","283371793_Handbook_of_Biomedical_Image_Analysis","270310048_Numerical_Solution_of_Partial_Differential_Equations_by_the_Finite_Element_Method","266943439_New_development_in_FreeFem","265402883_Courbes_et_surfaces_pour_la_CFAO","260331321_Interpolation_revisited_medical_images_application","243782714_Fast_image_coding_of_interval_interpolating_wavelets","243781271_Adaptive_Finite_Element_Methods_for_Parabolic_Problems_I_A_Linear_Model_Problem","232330858_Cardinal_interpolation_and_spline_functions_II_interpolation_of_data_of_power_growth"]}
