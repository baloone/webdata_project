{"id":"335840072_Industry_40_and_Lean_Manufacturing_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_and_Future_Research_Directions","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to aim at identifying the relationships between Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies and Lean Manufacturing (LM) practices.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA systematic literature review was conducted, in which 93 studies were analyzed according to their content and contextualization level.\n\nFindings\nIn total, 9 I4.0 technologies and 14 LM practices were identified and categorized according to different levels of both value stream application and synergy. From the 126 pairwise relationships, 24 were classified as being of high synergy (e.g. relationship between Cyber-Physical Systems and value stream mapping), revealing the existence of a positive interaction between LPs and I4.0 technologies toward the achievement of a higher operational performance. Further, three future research opportunities were suggested: to validate the proposed synergies among LPs and I4.0 technologies; to distinguish the effects of relationships on all levels of flow; and to examine the effect of such relationships on operational performance.\n\nOriginality/value\nWith the emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the specificities on the relationship between LM and I4.0 still need further investigation. This paper provides a better understanding of existing literature related to I4.0, LM, and their relationship, as well as pointing out research gaps to encourage future works.","authors":["Marcos Malinverni Pagliosa","Guilherme Luz Tortorella","Joao Carlos E.
