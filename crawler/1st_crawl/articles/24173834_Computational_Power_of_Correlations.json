{"id":"24173834_Computational_Power_of_Correlations","abstract":"We study the intrinsic computational power of correlations exploited in measurement-based quantum computation. By defining a general framework, the meaning of the computational power of correlations is made precise. This leads to a notion of resource states for measurement-based classical computation. Surprisingly, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt problems emerge as optimal examples. Our work exposes an intriguing relationship between the violation of local realistic models and the computational power of entangled resource states.","authors":["Janet Anders","Dan Browne"],"meta":["March 2009Physical Review Letters 102(5):050502","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.050502","SourcePubMed"],"references":["228109500_Proposed_Experiment_to_Test_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","291771926_Bell's_Theorem_Quantum_Theory_and_Conceptions_of_the_Universe","228109623_Quantum_mysteries_revisited","228109498_Quantum_generalizations_of_Bell's_inequality","226096736_Quantum_nonlocality_as_an_axiom","222832201_Cluster-state_quantum_computation","222669795_On_the_power_of_non-local_boxes","222301145_Parallelizing_Quantum_Circuits","221034376_Problems_Complete_for_L"]}
