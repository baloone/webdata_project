{"id":"221393453_A_Spatial_Logic_based_on_Regions_and_Connection","abstract":"We describe an interval logic for reasoningabout space. The logic simplifies an earliertheory developed by Randell and Cohn, andthat of Clarke upon which the former wasbased. The theory supports a simpler ontology,has fewer defined functions and relations,yet does not suffer in terms of its usefulexpressiveness. An axiomatisation of the newtheory and a comparison with the two originaltheories is given.1 IntroductionThe use of interval logics for the representation oftime...","authors":["David A Randell","Zhan Cui","Anthony G.
