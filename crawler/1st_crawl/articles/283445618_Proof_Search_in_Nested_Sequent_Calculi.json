{"id":"283445618_Proof_Search_in_Nested_Sequent_Calculi","abstract":"We propose a notion of focusing for nested sequent calculi for modal logics which brings down the complexity of proof search to that of the corresponding sequent calculi. The resulting systems are amenable to specifications in linear logic. Examples include modal logic K, a simply dependent bimodal logic and the standard non-normal modal logics. As byproduct we obtain the first nested sequent calculi for the considered non-normal modal logics.","authors":["Bj√∂rn Lellmann","Elaine Pimentel"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-48899-7_39","Conference: LPAR-20"],"references":["280561781_Linear_Nested_Sequents_2-Sequents_and_Hypersequents","275015758_Constructing_Cut_Free_Sequent_Systems_with_Context_Restrictions_Based_on_Classical_or_Intuitionistic_Logic","225983892_The_Method_of_Tree-Hypersequents_for_Modal_Propositional_Logic","270752729_An_extended_framework_for_specifying_and_reasoning_about_proof_systems","266859257_Labelled_tree_sequents_tree_hypersequents_and_nested_Deep_sequents","265817915_Proof_analysis_A_contribution_to_Hilbert's_last_problem","262159774_Cut_Elimination_in_Nested_Sequents_for_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logics","257144704_A_formal_framework_for_specifying_sequent_calculus_proof_systems","242640524_Modal_Logic_An_Introduction","226570137_Deep_Sequent_Systems_for_Modal_Logic"]}
