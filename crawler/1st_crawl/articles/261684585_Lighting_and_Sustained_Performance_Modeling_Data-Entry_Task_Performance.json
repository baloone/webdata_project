{"id":"261684585_Lighting_and_Sustained_Performance_Modeling_Data-Entry_Task_Performance","abstract":"A study was conducted on the lighting and sustained performance on modeling data-entry task performance (DETP), which consisted of several objectives. The first objective aims to quantify the effects of print size, luminance contrast and illuminance on the performance of DETP over a wide range of conditions. The second aims to construct an empirical model of the performance on the data-entry task under the different print and lighting conditions. The third objective was to compare the predictions of existing models of visual performance with the DETP model and with the measured mean work speeds. Finally, the aim to determine if a difference in decor was made in the performance of DETP.","authors":["Neil H. Eklund","Peter. Robert.
