{"id":"327079628_FAHP_approach_for_autonomic_resource_provisioning_of_multitier_applications_in_cloud_computing_environments","abstract":"Recent advancements in web-based application, especially in cloud computing environment, allows cloud service providers to deploy and provide web-based services in the form of multitier applications. One of the most suitable infrastructure for the running of multitier applications is a cloud computing infrastructure. Since the arrival rate of users to the multitier applications varies over the time, deciding about the right amount of resources required to handle the each tier of multitier applications is not trivial, and it depends on the current workload of its each tier. Therefore, it is necessary to automatically provision resources to deal with fluctuating demands of the multitier applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid resource provisioning approach for multitier applications based on a combination of the concept of the autonomic computing and the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process approach. Moreover, we present a framework based on MAPE-k control loop for autonomous resource provisioning of multitier applications in cloud computing environments. The effectiveness of the proposed approach under real and synthetic workloads was evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the proposed solution outperforms in terms of allocated virtual machines, response time, and cost compared with the other approaches.","authors":["Reihaneh Khorsand","Mostafa Ghobaei-Arani","Mohammadreza Ramezanpour"],"meta":["August 2018Software Practice and Experience","DOI:10.1002/spe.2627","Project: Auto-scaling Web Applications in Clouds"],"references":["320025335_Resource_provisioning_in_Science_Clouds_Requirements_and_challenges","319187819_CSA-WSC_cuckoo_search_algorithm_for_web_service_composition_in_cloud_environments","310606248_ATSDS_Adaptive_Two-Stage_Deadline-Constrained_Workflow_Scheduling_Considering_Run-time_Circumstances_in_Cloud_Computing_Environments","309439886_Dynamic_reconfiguration_of_cloud_application_architectures","308744415_Auto-Scaling_Web_Applications_in_Clouds_A_Taxonomy_and_Survey","303709541_An_autonomic_approach_for_resource_provisioning_of_cloud_services","266657635_Autonomic_resource_provisioning_for_cloud-based_software","261375085_Efficient_Resources_Provisioning_Based_on_Load_Forecasting_in_Cloud","259510668_Enabling_cost-aware_and_adaptive_elasticity_of_multi-tier_cloud_applications","258433528_Performance_Modelling_and_Simulation_of_Three-Tier_Applications_in_Cloud_and_Multi-Cloud_Environments","257924143_Integrating_Peer-to-Peer_and_Cloud_Computing_for_Massively_Multiuser_Online_Games","233985520_A_Dynamic_Resource_Provisioning_for_Cloud-based_Gaming","232358901_On_the_use_of_the_normalized_mean_square_error_in_evaluating_dispersion_model_performance","223305699_The_implementation_factors_that_influence_the_ERP_enterprise_resource_planning_benefits","220285825_Adaptive_resource_provisioning_for_read_intensive_multi-tier_applications_in_the_cloud","326538307_Energy-aware_scheduling_algorithm_for_time-constrained_workflow_tasks_in_DVFS-enabled_cloud_environment","316781828_Taxonomy_of_Workflow_Partitioning_Problems_and_Methods_in_Distributed_Environments","315572558_Fuzzy_Hierarchical_Analysis","313784391_An_autonomic_resource_provisioning_approach_for_service-based_cloud_applications_A_hybrid_approach","312499762_Survey_on_Prediction_Models_of_Applications_for_Resources_Provisioning_in_Cloud","309589442_Fuzzy_herarchical_analysis","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","304714470_Application_of_extend_analysis_method_on_Fuzzy_AHP","282223417_Automatic_Resource_Provisioning_A_Machine_Learning_Based_Proactive_Approach","280236575_Performance_modeling_and_analysis_of_virtualized_multi-tier_applications_under_dynamic_workloads","277679011_Multi-Cloud_Provisioning_and_Load_Distribution_for_Three-Tier_Applications","276235920_Automatic_provisioning_of_multi-tier_applications_in_cloud_computing_environments","271991303_SLA-based_optimisation_of_virtualised_resource_for_multi-tier_web_applications_in_cloud_data_centres","264937873_A_Survey_of_Resource_Management_in_Multi-Tier_Web_Applications","264372944_Autonomic_resource_contention-aware_scheduling","262368232_Towards_an_Architecture_for_Deploying_Elastic_Services_in_the_Cloud","261380035_Predicting_cloud_resource_provisioning_using_machine_learning_techniques","261161257_Cloud_Client_Prediction_Models_for_Cloud_Resource_Provisioning_in_a_Multitier_Web_Application_Environment","260604818_A_resource_elasticity_framework_for_QoS-aware_execution_of_cloud_applications","260193505_A_fast_and_robust_model_selection_algorithm_for_multi-input_multi-output_support_vector_machine","257721122_A_benefit-aware_on-demand_provisioning_approach_for_multi-tier_applications_in_cloud_computing","245492894_Key_quality_performance_evaluation_using_fuzzy_AHP","242589481_Technical_analysis_a_to_z","239546749_Statistical_Learning_Theory","229653130_Wiley_StatsRef_Statistics_Reference_Online","226925120_Fuzzy_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_and_its_Application","224408260_Time_Series_Prediction_Using_Support_Vector_Machines_A_Survey","224381249_Bovik_AC_Mean_squared_error_love_it_or_leave_it_-_A_new_look_at_signal_fidelity_measures_IEEE_Sig_Process_Mag_26_98-117","223113537_A_discussion_on_Extent_Analysis_Method_and_applications_of_fuzzy_AHP","223039251_Evaluation_of_hazardous_waste_transportation_firms_by_using_a_two_step_fuzzy-AHP_and_TOPSIS_methodology","222841479_Fuzzy_hierarchical_analysis_revisited","221210754_Automated_control_for_elastic_n-tier_workloads_based_on_empirical_modeling","220941361_On_the_Use_of_Machine_Learning_to_Predict_the_Time_and_Resources_Consumed_by_Applications","220565899_A_survey_of_Autonomic_Computing_-_Degrees_models_and_applications","220280566_CloudSim_A_Toolkit_for_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Cloud_Computing_Environments_and_Evaluation_of_Resource_Provisioning_Algorithms","220031305_Agile_Dynamic_Provisioning_of_Multi-Tier_Internet_Applications","2955831_The_Vision_Of_Autonomic_Computing","2595176_General_Cost_Functions_for_Support_Vector_Regression","2583519_Convex_Cost_Functions_for_Support_Vector_Regression"]}
