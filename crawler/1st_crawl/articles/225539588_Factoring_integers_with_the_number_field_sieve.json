{"id":"225539588_Factoring_integers_with_the_number_field_sieve","abstract":"In 1990, the ninth Fermat number was factored into primes by means of a new algorithm, the “number field sieve”, which was\nproposed by John Pollard. The present paper is devoted to the description and analysis of a more general version of the number\nfield sieve. It should be possible to use this algorithm to factor arbitrary integers into prime factors, not just integers\nof a special form like the ninth Fermat number. Under reasonable heuristic assumptions, the analysis predicts that the time\nneeded by the general number field sieve to factor n is exp((c+o(1))(logn)1/3(loglogn)2/3) (for n → ∞), where c=(64/9)1/3=1.9223. This is asymptotically faster than all other known factoring algorithms, such as the quadratic sieve and the elliptic\ncurve method.","authors":["J. P. Buhler","H. W.
