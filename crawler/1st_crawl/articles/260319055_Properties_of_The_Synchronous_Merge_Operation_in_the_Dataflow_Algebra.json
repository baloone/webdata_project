{"id":"260319055_Properties_of_The_Synchronous_Merge_Operation_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","abstract":"This report builds on recent work that has developed basic structures for representing the concepts of systems and subsystems within the dataflow algebra, at both its topological and event layers of detail, and in particular that has defined the synchronous merge operation to represent the composition of sub-systems within the event layer. This previous work had already established some properties of this operation, namely commutativity and associativity, and the main part of this report develops from this by also establishing the substitutability and identity properties of this operation. The report then goes on to revise an earlier informal definition of the concepts of sequences being either independent of or dependent on a set of possible actions, and the associated operations that extract the dependent and independent components of sequences. Finally, the report analyses the related concept of sequences being either partly or fully alive, which involves correcting some errors that had been found in results from earlier work. Formal specifications, dataflow algebra, systems, topology of systems, subsystems, behaviour of subsystems, composition of subsystems, synchronisation of systems.","authors":["A J Cowling"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
