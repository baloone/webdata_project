{"id":"224328063_Spectrum-Sensing_Algorithms_for_Cognitive_Radio_Based_on_Statistical_Covariances","abstract":"Spectrum sensing, i.e., detecting the presence of primary users in a licensed spectrum, is a fundamental problem in cognitive radio. Since the statistical covariances of the received signal and noise are usually different, they can be used to differentiate the case where the primary user's signal is present from the case where there is only noise. In this paper, spectrum-sensing algorithms are proposed based on the sample covariance matrix calculated from a limited number of received signal samples. Two test statistics are then extracted from the sample covariance matrix. A decision on the signal presence is made by comparing the two test statistics. Theoretical analysis for the proposed algorithms is given. Detection probability and the associated threshold are found based on the statistical theory. The methods do not need any information about the signal, channel, and noise power a priori . In addition, no synchronization is needed. Simulations based on narrow-band signals, captured digital television (DTV) signals, and multiple antenna signals are presented to verify the methods.","authors":["Yonghong Zeng","Ying-Chang Liang"],"meta":["June 2009IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 58(4):1804 - 1815","DOI:10.1109/TVT.2008.2005267","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["228340611_A_cognitive_radio_approach_for_usage_of_virtual_unlicensed_spectrum","224675828_Cooperative_Sensing_Among_Cognitive_Radios","4338176_Exploring_Cognitive_Techniques_for_Bandwidth_Management_in_Integrated_Underwater_Acoustic_Systems","313562600_Fundamental_limits_on_detection_in_low_SNR_under_noise_uncertainty","284776723_Cognitive_radio_Brain-empowered_wireless_communications_selected_areas_in_communications","242624905_Fundamentals_of_Statistical_Signal_Processing_Vol_II_Detection_Theory","232631688_Spectrum_Sensing_Measurements_of_Pilot_Energy_and_Collaborative_Detection","224734069_Spectral_Correlation_of_Modulated_Signals_Part_II--Digital_Modulation","224719801_Signature_based_spectrum_sensing_algorithms_for_IEEE_80222_WRAN","4259883_Genetic_Algorithm_Optimization_in_a_Cognitive_Radio_for_Autonomous_Vehicle_Communications"]}
