{"id":"306027117_Structured_summarization_for_news_events","abstract":"Helping users to understand the news is an acute problem nowadays as the users are struggling to keep up with tremendous amount of information published every day in the Internet. In this research, we focus on modelling the content of news events by their semantic relations with other events, and generating structured summarization.","authors":["Giang Binh Tran"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1145/2487788.2487940","Conference: the 22nd International Conference"],"references":["267800021_Annotating_Spatial_Containment_Relations_Between_Events","228922423_HeidelTime_High_quality_rule-based_extraction_and_normalization_of_temporal_expressions","228392419_SemEval-2007_Task_15_TempEval_temporal_relation_identification","224890667_MEAD_-_a_platform_for_multidocument_multilingual_text_summarization","221520137_Large-scale_hierarchical_text_classification_without_labelled_data","221301197_Query_based_event_extraction_along_a_timeline","221101609_Temporal_processing_with_the_TARSQI_Toolkit","221022004_CATE_Context-aware_timeline_for_entity_illustration","220746420_Causal_Relation_Extraction","220163611_An_effective_coherence_measure_to_determine_topical_consistency_in_user-generated_content","3420494_Learning_approaches_for_Detecting_and_Tracking_News_Events","2917668_Automatic_Detection_of_Causal_Relations_for_Question_Answering","2605406_Text_Mining_for_Causal_Relations","254008829_Trains_of_Thought_Generating_Information_Maps","242476336_On_the_coherence_and_structure_of_discourse","234801735_Temporal_summaries_of_new_topics","221299876_Evolutionary_timeline_summarization_a_balanced_optimization_framework_via_iterative_substitution","221013105_Minimally_Supervised_Event_Causality_Identification","220947187_Text_Summarization_Model_Based_on_Maximum_Coverage_Problem_and_its_Variant","220813080_TimeML-Compliant_Text_Analysis_for_Temporal_Reasoning","51939275_LexRank_Graph-based_Lexical_Centrality_As_Salience_in_Text_Summarization","7607003_Causal_coherence_and_the_availability_of_locations_and_objects_during_narrative_comprehension","2943606_Investigations_on_Event_Evolution_in_TDT","2882915_Catching_the_Drift_Probabilistic_Content_Models_with_Applications_to_Generation_and_Summarization","2303123_On-line_New_Event_Detection_and_Tracking"]}
