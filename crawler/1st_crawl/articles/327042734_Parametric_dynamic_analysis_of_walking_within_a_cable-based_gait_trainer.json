{"id":"327042734_Parametric_dynamic_analysis_of_walking_within_a_cable-based_gait_trainer","abstract":"In this paper, a parametric analysis of the inverse dynamics of an upright partially unloaded walking is performed. This motion is produced through a gait-training machine emulating the over-ground walking using a body weight support mechanism and a cable-driven robot. The input motion is the kinematics of a normal gait, and the ultimate output result is the required tensions to be generated by the cable robot in order to drive the lower limb. The dynamic analysis is carried out based on the Newtonâ€“Euler approach. A Matlab Simscape model is also built to validate the analytical results. The obtained dynamic model is used to investigate the effect of the variation of the gait simulation parameters on the actuation wrench and the cable tensions. The obtained results could be used to determine the optimal design of the gait trainer actuators and they are useful in estimating optimal gait training parameters.","authors":["Houssein Lamine","Lotfi Romdhane","Sami Bennour"],"meta":["August 2018Robotica 37(7):1-15","DOI:10.1017/S0263574718000711","Project: Robotic Rehabilitation"],"references":["304813920_Concurrent_validity_of_the_Microsoft_Kinect_for_Windows_v2_for_measuring_spatiotemporal_gait_parameters","293011327_Validity_of_the_Kinect_for_Gait_Assessment_A_Focused_Review","291352855_HuMoD_-_A_versatile_and_open_database_for_the_investigation_modeling_and_simulation_of_human_motion_dynamics_on_actuation_level","282800052_Computation_of_ground_reaction_force_using_Zero_Moment_Point","282494753_Foot-ground_contact_modeling_within_human_gait_simulations_from_Kelvin-Voigt_to_hyper-volumetric_models","265691637_The_Combined_Effects_of_Body_Weight_Support_and_Gait_Speed_on_Gait_Related_Muscle_Activity_A_Comparison_between_Walking_in_the_Lokomat_Exoskeleton_and_Regular_Treadmill_Walking","239632845_Experimental_identification_and_analytical_modelling_of_human_walking_forces_Literature_review","51972812_Gait_Training_in_Human_Spinal_Cord_Injury_Using_Electromechanical_Systems_Effect_of_Device_Type_and_Patient_Characteristics","3039448_OpenSim_Open-Source_Software_to_Create_and_Analyze_Dynamic_Simulations_of_Movement","315992774_Design_Study_of_a_Cable-based_Gait_Training_Machine","308921967_Improved_kinect-based_spatiotemporal_and_kinematic_treadmill_gait_assessment","305037191_Full-Body_Musculoskeletal_Model_for_Muscle-Driven_Simulation_of_Human_Gait","297754241_Design_of_cable-driven_parallel_manipulators_for_a_specific_workspace_using_interval_analysis","291386365_Dynamically_adjustable_foot-ground_contact_model_to_estimate_ground_reaction_force_during_walking_and_running","275717970_Imitation_of_Dynamic_Walking_With_BSN_for_Humanoid_Robot","273778401_Effect_of_Body_Weight-supported_Walking_on_Exercise_Capacity_and_Walking_Speed_in_Patients_with_Knee_Osteoarthritis_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial","261953764_Prediction_of_ground_reaction_forces_and_moments_during_various_activities_of_daily_living","259158452_Biomechanical_assessment_of_human_posture_A_literature_review","246438841_Biomechanics_and_muscle_coordination_of_human_walking","229458787_Optimization-based_dynamic_human_walking_prediction_One_step_formulation","223419559_Workspace_analysis_of_fully_restrained_cable-driven_manipulators","220061949_Planar_Cable-Direct-Driven_Robots_Design_for_Wrench_Exertion","31734438_Biomechanics_and_Motor_Control_of_Human_Movement_DA_Winter","23311964_Kinematic_trajectories_while_walking_within_the_Lokomat_robotic_gait-orthosis","23142391_Whole_body_inverse_dynamics_over_a_complete_gait_cycle_based_only_on_measured_kinematics","14675869_An_inverse_dynamics_model_for_the_analysis_reconstruction_and_prediction_of_bipedal_walking","6786248_A_Novel_Mechatronic_Body_Weight_Support_System"]}
