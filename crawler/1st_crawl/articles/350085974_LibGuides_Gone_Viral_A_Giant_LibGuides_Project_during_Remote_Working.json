{"id":"350085974_LibGuides_Gone_Viral_A_Giant_LibGuides_Project_during_Remote_Working","abstract":"Librarian-created course guides were created at The Ohio State University using the LibGuides system, with 460 courses being connected to undergraduate courses in six departments. The process of identifying content, creating guide templates and courses, and working with staff members doing remote work projects is covered. A special subset of the guides involves a more intense examination of courses’ content and the collaboration of the campus’s Mathematics and Statistics Learning Center. Guide use in the first semester and future directions are discussed.","authors":["Daniel S.
