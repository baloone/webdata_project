{"id":"288854638_Assessing_Different_Crossover_Operators_for_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","abstract":"Many crossover operators have been proposed \nin literature on evolutionary algorithms, however, it is \nstill unclear which crossover operator works best for a \ngiven optimization problem. In this study, eight different \ncrossover operators specially designed for travelling \nsalesman problem, namely, Two-Point Crossover, \nPartially Mapped Crossover, Cycle Crossover, Shuffle \nCrossover, Edge Recombination Crossover, Uniform \nOrder-based Crossover, Sub-tour Exchange Crossover, \nand Sequential Constructive Crossover are evaluated \nempirically. The select crossover operators were \nimplemented to build an experimental setup upon which \nsimulations were run. Four benchmark instances of \ntravelling salesman problem, two symmetric (ST70 and \nTSP225) and two asymmetric (FTV100 and FTV170), \nwere used to thoroughly assess the select crossover \noperators. The performance of these operators was \nanalyzed in terms of solution quality and computational \ncost. It was found that Sequential Constructive Crossover \noutperformed other operators in attaining 'good' quality \nsolution, whereas Two-Point Crossover outperformed \nother operators in terms of computational cost. It was also \nobserved that the performance of different crossover \noperators is much better for relatively small number of \ncities, both in terms of solution quality and computational \ncost, however, for relatively large number of cities their \nperformance greatly degrades","authors":["Imtiaz H Khan"],"meta":["October 2015International Journal of Intelligent Systems Technologies and Applications 7(11):19-25","DOI:10.5815/ijisa.2015.11.03"],"references":["280768506_Performance_comparison_of_crossover_operators_for_postfix_genetic_programming","269398200_A_Comparative_Study_of_EAG_and_PBIL_on_Large-Scale_Global_Optimization_Problems","268043232_Comparison_of_eight_evolutionary_crossover_operators_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem","247607255_A_Formal_Analysis_of_the_Role_of_MultiPoint_Crossover_in_Genetic_Algorithms","220813123_Representation_and_Hidden_Bias_II_Eliminating_Defining_Length_Bias_in_Genetic_Search_via_Shuffle_Crossover","220777037_Evaluation_of_Crossover_Operator_Performance_in_Genetic_Algorithms_with_Binary_Representation","2772327_A_Formal_Analysis_of_the_Role_of_Multi-Point_Crossover_in_Genetic_Algorithms","2527549_The_Traveling_Salesman_and_Sequence_Scheduling_Quality_Solutions_Using_Genetic_Edge_Recombination","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","268311593_Evolutionary_Computation","242356870_Adaptation_In_Natural_And_Artificial_Systems","240361072_Travelling_salesman_problem_using_genetic_algorithms","235890198_Genetic_Programming_On_the_Programming_of_Computers_by_Means_of_Natural_Selection_Complex_Adaptive_Systems","235709965_Evolutionsstrategie_Optimierung_technischer_Systeme_nach_Prinzipien_der_biolo-gi-schen_Evolution","228911455_Comparison_of_a_crossover_operator_in_binary-coded_genetic_algorithms","220885643_A_Comparison_of_Genetic_Sequencing_Operators","220689401_An_Introduction_to_Genetic_Algorithms_MIT_Press_Cambridge","216301297_Evolutionstrategie_Optimierung_Technisher_Systeme_nach_Prinzipien_des_Biologischen_Evolution","201976411_A_Study_of_Permutation_Crossover_Operators_on_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","201976370_Alleles_Loci_and_the_Traveling_Saleman_Problem","35578608_An_Analysis_of_the_Behavior_of_a_Class_of_Genetic_Adaptive_Systems"]}
