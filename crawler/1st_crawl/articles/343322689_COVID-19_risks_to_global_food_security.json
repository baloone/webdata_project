{"id":"343322689_COVID-19_risks_to_global_food_security","abstract":"COVID-19 poses acute threats to food security. The worst of these arise from the global recession that is causing many to lose their incomes and threatens the access of many vulnerable people to the food they need. Other threats arise from disruptions in agricultural input markets, production, marketing, and distribution of food. To avoid major food crises, governments of poor and rich nations should both focus on income support to protect food access for the most vulnerable, enact social distancing in innovative ways to avoid supply chain disruptions, and facilitate food trade and movement of food-sector workers.","authors":["David Laborde","Will John Martin","Johan Swinnen","Rob Vos"],"meta":["July 2020Science 369(6503):500-502","DOI:10.1126/science.abc4765","Project: COVID-19 and food security"],"references":["342068871_Estimating_the_Poverty_Impact_of_COVID-19_The_MIRAGRODEP_and_POVANA_frameworks_1","226841645_Food_Crisis_and_Export_Taxation_The_Cost_of_Non-cooperative_Trade_Policies"]}
