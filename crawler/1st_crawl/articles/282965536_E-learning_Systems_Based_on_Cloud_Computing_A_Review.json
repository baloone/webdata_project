{"id":"282965536_E-learning_Systems_Based_on_Cloud_Computing_A_Review","abstract":"Today and during the recent years, the Internet is a place to read web pages that allow users to environmental education and implementation of software applications that is changing. As with rapid growth of the cloud computing architecture usage, more and more industries move their focus from investing into processing power to renting processing power from a specialized vendor but education field is no different. E-learning systems usually require many hardware and software resources. Cloud computing technologies have changed the way applications are developed and accessed. They are aimed at running applications as services over the Internet on a scalable infrastructure. Now, Cloud computing that introduces efficient scale mechanism can let construction of E-learning system be entrusted to suppliers and provide a new mode for E-learning. Therefore, an E-learning system based on Cloud computing infrastructure is feasible and it can greatly improve the efficiency of investment and the power of management, which can make E-learning system development into a virtuous circle and achieve a win-win situation for suppliers and customers.","authors":["Ghazal Riahi"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia Computer Science 62:352-359","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.415"],"references":["221425225_An_E-learning_Ecosystem_Based_on_Cloud_Computing_Infrastructure","4253689_E-Learning_Ecosystem_ELES_-_A_Holistic_Approach_for_the_Development_of_more_Effective_Learning_Environment_for_Small-and-Medium_Sized_Enterprises_SMEs"]}
