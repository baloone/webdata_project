{"id":"303773434_Pick_the_right_team_and_make_a_blockbuster_a_social_analysis_through_movie_history","abstract":"We explore the relation between team performance and its topological network characteristics by creating a social network of movie producers and extracting topological features from each team. Then, we employ machine learning techniques to build a movie success predictor based on the extracted features. Results show topological features have predictive power over movie's success and can also be included in other non-topological models to improve accuracy.","authors":["Wladston Ferreira Filho","Ana Paula Couto da Silva","Mirella M Moro"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1145/2851613.2851812","Conference: the 31st Annual ACM Symposium"],"references":["265252616_Computing_Classic_Closeness_Centrality_at_Scale","262401833_Predicting_IMDB_Movie_Ratings_Using_Social_Media","262240293_Online_Team_Formation_in_Social_Networks","259533659_A_user_opinion_and_metadata_mining_scheme_for_predicting_box_office_performance_of_movies_in_the_social_network_environment","251800035_Collaboration_and_Creativity_The_Small_World_Problem","224217670_Analysis_and_Exploitation_of_Musician_Social_Networks_for_Recommendation_and_Discovery","51402142_The_Science_of_Team_Science_Overview_of_the_Field_and_Introduction_to_the_Supplement","312982289_Bayesian_interpolation","281453355_Brokerage_Closure_An_Introduction_to_Social_Capital","271880846_Network_structure_and_team_performance_The_case_of_English_Premier_League_soccer_teams","270293976_Pre-production_forecasting_of_movie_revenues_with_a_dynamic_artificial_neural_network","264914531_Nonparametric_statistics_A_step-by-step_approach_2nd_ed","262311391_Launch_hard_or_go_home_predicting_the_success_of_kickstarter_campaigns","234021404_Structural_Holes_and_Good_Ideas","228375577_The_Power_of_Stars_Do_Star_Actors_Drive_the_Success_of_Movies","221933085_Introduction_To_Graph_Theory","2354046_Bayesian_Interpolation"]}
