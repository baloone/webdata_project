{"id":"305873031_Learning_sensorimotor_navigation_using_synchrony-based_partner_selection","abstract":"Future robots are supposed to become our partners and share the environments where we live in our daily life. Considering the fact that they will have to co-exist with \"nonexpert\" people (elders, impaired people, children, etc.), we must rethink the way we design human/robot interactions. In this paper, we take a radical simplification route taking advantage from recent discoveries in low-level human interactions and dynamical motor control. Indeed, we argue for the need to take the dynamics of the interactions into account. Therefore, we propose a bio-inspired neuronal architecture to mimics adult/infant interactions that: (1) are initiated thanks to synchrony-based partner selection, (2) are maintained and re-engaged thanks to partner recognition and focus of attention, and (3) allow for learning sensorimotor navigation based on place/action associations. Our experiment shows good results for the learning of a navigation area and proves that this approach is promising for more complex tasks and interactions.","authors":["Marwen Belkaid","Caroline Lesueur-Grand","Ghiles Mostafaoui","Nicolas Cuperlier"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2952744.2952754","Conference: the International Conference","Projects: ANR DIRACmodel of the sensorimotor ans social development"],"references":["314828392_Interactive_machine_learning","277558621_Condition-invariant_Top-down_visual_place_recognition","271226221_Computational_cognitive_models_of_spatial_memory_in_navigation_space_A_review","264235500_Combining_Local_and_Global_Image_Features_for_Object_Class_Recognition","263982738_Robustness_Study_of_a_Multimodal_Compass_Inspired_from_HD-Cells_and_Dynamic_Neural_Fields","261268125_Synchrony_as_a_Way_to_Choose_an_Interacting_Partner","261183203_Synchrony_Detection_as_a_Reinforcement_Signal_for_Learning_Application_to_Human_Robot_Interaction","257649923_From_Self-Assessment_to_Frustration_A_Small_Step_Towards_Autonomy_in_Robotic_Navigation","257307139_Training_a_Robot_via_Human_Feedback_A_Case_Study","224086293_Interactive_Teaching_for_Vision-Based_Mobile_Robots_A_Sensory-Motor_Approach","223148537_PerAc_A_neural_architecture_to_control_artificial_animals","221710003_Robustness_of_Visual_Place_Cells_in_Dynamic_Indoor_and_Outdoor_Environment","221473542_Teaching_robots_by_moulding_behavior_and_scaffolding_the_environment","221368944_A_comparison_of_color_features_for_visual_concept_classification","221116436_Interest_of_Spatial_Context_for_a_Place_Cell_Based_Navigation_Model","220613473_Human-Robot_Interaction_A_Survey","29612990_Distributed_Real_Time_Neural_Networks_In_Interactive_Complex_Systems","11446884_From_view_cells_and_place_cells_to_cognitive_map_learning_Processing_stages_of_the_hippocampal_system","9068875_Heterogeneous_Modulation_of_Place_Cell_Firing_by_Changes_in_Context","8445484_Visual_Objects_in_Context","2480061_Interactive_Machine_Learning","272018282_Integration_of_Global_and_Local_Salient_Features_for_Scene_Modeling_in_Mobile_Robot_Applications","268733104_Speeded-up_robust_features_SURF","264118059_HS_Combined_Histogram_for_Visual_Memory_Building_and_Scene_Recognition_in_Outdoor_Environments","247062713_Optical_Flow_From_1D_Correlation_Application_to_a_Simple_Time-To-Crash_Detector","240269155_Expectancies_for_Social_Contingency_in_2-Month_Olds","224329582_Mapping_a_Suburb_With_a_Single_Camera_Using_a_Biologically_Inspired_SLAM_System","223213593_Forest_Before_Trees_The_Precedence_of_Global_Features_in_Visual_Perception","222831088_Contextual_cueing_of_visual_attention","222653628_Perceived_self_in_infancy","222254602_Chapter_44_The_hippocampus_context_processing_and_episodic_memory","220659651_Using_Canny's_criteria_to_derive_a_recursively_implemented_optimal_edge_detector","220396648_Biologically_Inspired_Mobile_Robot_Vision_Localization","220122333_Regulation_and_Entrainment_in_Human-Robot_Interaction","200038910_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","13646400_Intersensory_Redundancy_Facilitates_Learning_of_Arbitrary_Relations_between_Vowel_Sounds_and_Objects_in_Seven-Month-Old_Infants","6768383_Torralba_A_Building_the_GIST_of_a_scene_The_role_of_global_image_features_in_recognition_Progress_in_Brain_Research_155_23-36","6673915_Unintended_interpersonal_co-ordination_Can_we_march_to_the_beat_of_our_own_drum","2481612_Regulation_and_Entrainment_in_Human-Robot"]}
