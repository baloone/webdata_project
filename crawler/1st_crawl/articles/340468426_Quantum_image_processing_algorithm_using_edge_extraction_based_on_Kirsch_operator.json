{"id":"340468426_Quantum_image_processing_algorithm_using_edge_extraction_based_on_Kirsch_operator","abstract":"In this work, a quantum image processing algorithm is developed using the edge extraction method together with the Kirsch operator. In our approach, novel enhanced quantum representation (NEQR) is employed as the image representation model for processing quantum image, which generates results of edge extraction using the Kirsch operator. The proposed algorithm can perform real-time image processing with high accuracy. We carry out the design, analyses, and simulations of quantum circuits based on our approach, which shows that the image processing speed and acuracy are much better than the classical edge extraction algorithms.","authors":["pengao xu","zhenxing he","Tian-Hui Qiu","Hongyang Ma"],"meta":["April 2020Optics Express 28(9)","DOI:10.1364/OE.386283"],"references":["337645730_Quantum_Multi-User_Broadcast_Protocol_for_the_Platform_as_a_Service_Model","337636947_Quantum_Private_Query_Based_on_Stable_Error_Correcting_Code_in_the_Case_of_Noise","329353190_Quantum_image_edge_extraction_based_on_classical_Sobel_operator_for_NEQR","329249836_LSBs-based_quantum_color_images_watermarking_algorithm_in_edge_region","319233095_A_novel_quantum_LSB-based_steganography_method_using_the_Gray_code_for_colored_quantum_images","318578794_Quantum_watermarking_scheme_through_Arnold_scrambling_and_LSB_steganography","315941002_Quantum_image_processing_A_review_of_advances_in_its_security_technologies","303698297_Quantum_Image_Matching","276481467_Quantum_morphology_operations_based_on_quantum_representation_model","257641933_NEQR_A_novel_enhanced_quantum_representation_of_digital_images","253158806_Storing_Processing_and_Retrieving_an_Image_using_Quantum_Mechanics","252504991_A_new_quantum_edge_detection_algorithm_for_medical_images","236097326_Toward_real-time_quantum_imaging_with_a_single_pixel_camera","225705147_Ball_JL_Processing_images_in_entangled_quantum_systems_Quantum_Inf_Process_91_1-11","224377985_A_Computational_Approach_To_Edge_Detection","2201176_Elementary_gates_for_quantum_computation","336731552_Quantum_Imaging_and_Information","276481531_Local_feature_point_extraction_for_quantum_images","260912480_Histogram-based_segmentation_of_quantum_images","257641824_A_watermark_strategy_for_quantum_images_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","237243628_Quantum_Theory_the_Church-Turing_Principle_and_the_Universal_Quantum_Computer","235800177_A_flexible_representation_of_quantum_images_for_polynomial_preparation_image_compression_and_processing_operations_Quantum_Inf","226810696_Simulating_physics_with_computers_Int_J_Theor_Phys_2167467-488","222512070_Computer_determination_of_the_constituent_structure_of_biologic_images","220153284_Strategies_for_designing_geometric_transformations_on_quantum_images"]}
