{"id":"268884232_Approximate_Pareto_sets_of_minimal_size_for_multi-objective_optimization_problems","abstract":"We are interested in a problem introduced by Vassilvitskii and Yannakakis (2005), the computation of a minimum set of solutions that approximates within an accuracy εε the Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization problem. We mainly establish a new 3-approximation algorithm for the bi-objective case. We also propose a study of the greedy algorithm performance for the tri-objective case when the points are given explicitly, answering an open question raised by Koltun and Papadimitriou in (2007).","authors":["Cristina Bazgan","Florian Jamain","Daniel Vanderpooten"],"meta":["October 2014Operations Research Letters 43(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.orl.2014.10.003"],"references":["226963624_Multiobjective_Optimization_Improved_FPTAS_for_Shortest_Paths_and_Non-Linear_Objectives_with_Applications","225180047_Small_Approximate_Pareto_Sets_for_Bi-objective_Shortest_Paths_and_Other_Problems","220617796_Small_Approximate_Pareto_Sets_for_Biobjective_Shortest_Paths_and_Other_Problems","268065918_New_approaches_to_multi-objective_optimization","265372525_Bicriterion_Path_Problems","245587132_Bicriterion_Single_Machine_Scheduling_with_Resource_Dependent_Processing_Times","230595783_Approximation_of_Pareto_Optima_in_Multiple-Objective_Shortest-Path_Problems","227447479_Approximating_Multiobjective_Knapsack_Problems","222559523_Approximately_dominating_representatives","220152023_Efficiently_computing_succinct_trade-off_curves","220060122_A_fully_polynomial_bicriteria_approximation_scheme_for_the_constrained_spanning_tree_problem","216300582_Multicriteria_Optimization","41221865_Solving_efficiently_the_0-1_multi-objective_knapsack_problem","3880857_On_the_approximability_of_trade-offs_and_optimal_access_of_Web_sources"]}
