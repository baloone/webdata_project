{"id":"262744835_Profile_and_Scientific_Production_of_Brazilian_Researchers_in_Oral_Pathology","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the profile and scientific production of research­ers in oral pathology who received grants in the area of Dentistry from the Brazilian National Research and Development Council. MATERIAL AND METHOD : The standardized online curriculum vitae (Curriculum Lattes) of 34 researchers in oral pathology who received grants in the years 2008-2010 were analyzed. The variables were: gender, affiliation, time from completion of the PhD program, scientific production, and supervision of undergraduate students and Master's and PhD programs. RESULT: The States of São Paulo (52.94%) and Minas Gerais (26.47%) were responsible for 79.41% of the researchers. Regarding af­filiation, three institutions accounted for approximately 44.11% of the researchers: UNICAMP (17.64%); USP (14.70%); and UFMG (11.76%). The researchers published a total of 906 full-text articles, with a median of 26.64 articles per re­searcher in the triennium and 8.88 articles per year. It was found that of 906 articles published, 366 (40.39%) were published in strata A (qualis-CAPES). Oral pathology researchers supervised 437 scientific initiation and post-graduate students. Of these, 138 (31.57%) were scientific initiation, 169 (38.67%) were Master and 130 (29.74%) were PhD students. CONCLUSION: An important scientific production of oral pathology researchers in the 2008-2010 triennium was observed. By knowing the profile of researchers in oral pathology, more effective strategies for encouraging scientific production and demanding resources to finance research projects can be defined.","authors":["Maria Ivanilde Pereira Santos","Bárbara Gusmão Lopes Leite","Lívia Máris Ribeiro Paranaíba","Eduardo Araujo Oliveira"],"meta":["December 2012Revista de odontologia da UNESP / Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) 41(6):390-395","DOI:10.1590/S1807-25772012000600004"],"references":["250988715_Perfil_dos_pesquisadores_da_Saude_Coletiva_no_Conselho_Nacional_de_Desenvolvimento_Cientifico_e_Tecnologico","240768503_Perfil_dos_pesquisadores_da_area_de_odontologia_no_Conselho_Nacional_de_Desenvolvimento_Cientifico_e_Tecnologico_CNPq","220364665_Brazilian_computer_science_research_Gender_and_regional_distributions","51216935_A_map_of_Brazilian_dental_research_in_the_last_decade","51097248_Profile_and_scientific_production_of_CNPq_researchers_in_Nephrology_and_Urology","49654142_Brazilian_Science_Riding_a_Gusher","23411193_Academic_trajectories_of_dental_researchers_receiving_CNPq's_productivity_grants","23231246_Scientific_output_trends_in_oral_health_in_Brazil","8679980_A_profile_of_researchers_in_public_health_with_productivity_grants_from_the_Brazilian_National_Research_Council_CNPq","44660754_High_hopes_for_Brazilian_science"]}
