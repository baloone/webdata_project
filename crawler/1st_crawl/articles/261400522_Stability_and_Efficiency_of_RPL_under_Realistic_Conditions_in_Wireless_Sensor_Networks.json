{"id":"261400522_Stability_and_Efficiency_of_RPL_under_Realistic_Conditions_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is one of the emerging routing standards for multihop Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). RPL is based on the construction of a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG), which offers a loop-free topology to route data packets. While several routing metrics have been proposed in the literature, it is unclear how they perform with RPL. In this paper, we analyze the impact of different PHY and MAC metrics on the stability and efficiency of RPL. We highlight the fact that realistic conditions lead to instabilities and oscillations in the routing structure. While minimizing the hop length leads to a stable but poor routing structure, more sophisticated link metrics such as ETX reflect more clearly the radio link quality but increase the number of DODAG reconfigurations. We also provided a detailed methodology to measure the DODAG stability and to implement efficiently each routing metric with RPL.","authors":["Oana Iova","Fabrice Theoleyre","Thomas NoÃ«l"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666490","Conference: Personal Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), 2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on","Project: Routing in the Internet of Things"],"references":["271514745_RPL_IPv6_Routing_Protocol_for_Low_power_and_Lossy_Networks","270394721_RFC6206_The_Trickle_Algorithm","228757743_Four_Bit_Wireless_Link_Estimation","280287730_A_High-Throughput_Path_Metric_for_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Routing","279334147_A_high-throughput_path_metric_for_multi-_wireless_routing","277286357_End-to-end_routing_behavior_in_the_Internet","261464084_A_performance_evaluation_study_of_RPL_Routing_Protocol_for_Low_power_and_Lossy_Networks","257582309_RPL_in_a_nutshell_A_survey","243776760_A_control-theoretic_approach_to_ow_control","238576299_RSSI_is_under_appreciated"]}
