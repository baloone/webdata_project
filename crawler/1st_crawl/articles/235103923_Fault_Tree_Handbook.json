{"id":"235103923_Fault_Tree_Handbook","abstract":"This handbook describes a methodology for reliability analysis of complex systems such as those which comprise the engineered safety features of nuclear power generating stations. After an initial overview of the available system analysis approaches, the handbook focuses on a description of the deductive method known as fault tree analysis. The following aspects of fault tree analysis are covered: (1) basic concepts for fault tree analysis; (2) basic elements of a fault tree; (3) fault tree construction; (4) probability. statistics, and Boolean algebra for the fault tree analyst; (5) qualitative and quantitative fault tree evaluation techniques; and (6) computer codes for fault tree evaluation. Also discussed are several example problems illustrating the basic concepts of fault tree construction and evaluation.","authors":["W. E. Vesely","F. F. Goldberg","N. H. Roberts","D. F.
