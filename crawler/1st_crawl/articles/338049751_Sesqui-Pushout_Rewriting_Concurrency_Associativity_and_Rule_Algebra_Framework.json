{"id":"338049751_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting_Concurrency_Associativity_and_Rule_Algebra_Framework","abstract":"Sesqui-pushout (SqPO) rewriting is a variant of transformations of graph-like and other types of structures that fit into the framework of adhesive categories where deletion in unknown context may be implemented. We provide the first account of a concurrency theorem for this important type of rewriting, and we demonstrate the additional mathematical property of a form of associativity for these theories. Associativity may then be exploited to construct so-called rule algebras (of SqPO type), based upon which in particular a universal framework of continuous-time Markov chains for stochastic SqPO rewriting systems may be realized.","authors":["Nicolas Behr"],"meta":["December 2019","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.309.2"],"references":["348292952_Combinatorial_Conversion_and_Moment_Bisimulation_for_Stochastic_Rewriting_Systems","346286334_Tracelets_and_Tracelet_Analysis_Of_Compositional_Rewriting_Systems","321902612_Combinatorics_of_chemical_reaction_systems","339210141_M-adhesive_transformation_systems_with_nested_application_conditions","329342623_Probabilistic_timed_graph_transformation_systems","327425382_Rule_algebras_for_adhesive_categories","325409185_Characterisation_of_Parallel_Independence_in_AGREE-Rewriting","322957849_On_the_Essence_of_Parallel_Independence_for_the_Double-Pushout_and_Sesqui-Pushout_Approaches","321514957_Lie_Groups_Lie_Algebras_and_Representations","321514711_Springer_Series_in_Statistics"]}
