{"id":"350120873_The_Rise_of_Deepfakes_A_Conceptual_Framework_and_Research_Agenda_for_Marketing","abstract":"Deepfakes, digital content created via machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence technology, are generating interest among marketers and the general population alike and are often portrayed as a “phantom menace” in the media. Despite relevance to marketing theory and practice, deepfakes—and the opportunities for benefit or deviance they provide—are little understood or discussed. This article introduces deepfakes to the marketing literature and proposes a typology, conceptual framework, and associated research agenda, underpinned by theorizing based on balanced centricity, to guide the future investigation of deepfakes in marketing scholarship. The article makes an argument for balance (i.e., situations where all stakeholders benefit), and it is hoped that this article may provide a foundation for future research and application of deepfakes as “a new hope” for marketing.","authors":["Lucas Whittaker","Kate Letheren","Rory Mulcahy"],"meta":["March 2021","DOI:10.1177/1839334921999479"],"references":["343215641_Do_Microtargeted_Deepfakes_Have_Real_Effects_on_Political_Attitudes","339935174_Deepfake_a_social_construction_of_technology_perspective","339385335_Deepfakes_and_Disinformation_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Synthetic_Political_Video_on_Deception_Uncertainty_and_Trust_in_News","338953266_When_less_is_more_the_impact_of_macro_and_micro_social_media_influencers'_disclosure","338144721_Deepfakes_Trick_or_treat","346700303_All_Around_Me_Are_Synthetic_Faces_The_Mad_World_of_AI-Generated_Media","341484248_Brave_New_World_On_AI_and_the_Management_of_Customer_Relationships","340928844_Smart_Advertising_System","340793490_AI-Enabled_Biometrics_in_Recruiting_Insights_from_Marketers_for_Managers","340723081_Programmatic_Creative_AI_Can_Think_but_it_Cannot_Feel"]}
