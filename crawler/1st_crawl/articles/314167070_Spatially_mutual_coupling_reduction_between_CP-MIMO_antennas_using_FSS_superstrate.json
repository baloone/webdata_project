{"id":"314167070_Spatially_mutual_coupling_reduction_between_CP-MIMO_antennas_using_FSS_superstrate","abstract":"A new approach to suppress mutual coupling of spatial electromagnetic fields between two circularly polarised (CP) antennas using frequency selective surface (FSS) technique around 30 GHz is presented. The transmission-type FSS layer with the CP capability is placed on the top of two closely multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. The study shows that the FSS layer can suppress an average of 10 dB mutual coupling between two adjacent CP-MIMO antennas. The proposed technique does not degrade the impedance and radiation performance of the antenna in comparison with the antenna without FSS layer. The two-port CP antennas are fabricated and measured to validate the simulation results. Good agreement is achieved between simulated and measured results in terms of the reflection coefficient, mutual coupling, and axial ratio.","authors":["Mohammad Akbari Choubar","Mohamed Mamdouh Ali","Mohammadmahdi Farahani","A.
