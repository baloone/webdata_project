{"id":"261958821_A_model_of_factors_affecting_independent_learners'_engagement_with_feedback_on_language_learning_tasks","abstract":"In independent learning contexts, the effectiveness of the feedback dialogue between student and tutor or, in the absence of a tutor, the quality of the learning materials, is essential to successful learning. Using the voices of participants as the prime source of data through a combination of data-driven and concept-driven approaches, this investigation attempts to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of the learning process as students express emotional reactions to the learning environment and in particular the written feedback from their tutors and the learning materials. To account for the different ways in which adult learners studying independently engage both cognitively and emotionally with external feedback, we propose a model based on four key drivers: goal relevance, knowledge, self-confidence, and roles. We conclude that only when these key drivers are aligned with each other can learners in independent settings engage with external feedback and learn from it.","authors":["María Fernández-Toro","Stella Hurd"],"meta":["April 2014Distance Education 35(1)","DOI:10.1080/01587919.2014.891434"],"references":["233337186_From_monologue_to_dialogue_Improving_written_feedback_processes_in_mass_higher_education","232582001_On_the_Causal_Effects_of_Perceived_Competence_on_Intrinsic_Motivation_A_Test_of_Cognitive_Evaluation_Theory","232565363_Possible_Selves","232025193_Learners_processing_uptake_and_retention_of_corrective_feedback_on_writing_Case_studies","209431355_Motivation_and_Beliefs_in_Distance_Language_Learning_The_Case_of_English_Learners_at_SRTVU_an_Open_University_in_China","42792639_Distant_Voices_Learners'_Stories_About_the_Affective_Side_of_Learning_a_Language_at_a_Distance","42792075_Towards_a_Better_Understanding_of_the_Dynamic_Role_of_the_Distance_Language_Learner_Learner_perceptions_of_personality_motivation_roles_and_approaches","19545638_Self-Discrepancy_A_Theory_Relating_Self_and_Affect","11946306_Self-Determination_Theory_and_the_Facilitation_of_Intrinsic_Motivation_Social_Development_and_Well-Being","346626073_Language_Learning_in_Distance_Education","332191556_Evaluating_written_feedback","329063324_8_'Why_am_I_Doing_This'_Maintaining_Motivation_8_'Why_am_I_Doing_This'_Maintaining_Motivation_in_Distance_Language_Learning","324973841_11_A_Person-in-Context_Relational_View_of_Emergent_Motivation_Self_and_Identity","324973609_2_The_L2_Motivational_Self_System","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","313614397_Motivation_autonomy_and_sociocultural_theory","303381539_Using_concurrent_protocols_to_explore_L2_writing_processes_Methodological_issues_in_the_collection_and_analysis_of_data","285105164_A_person-in-context_relational_view_of_emergent_motivation_self_and_identity","272747829_Motivation_language_identities_and_the_L2_self_A_theoretical_overview","262857766_Are_the_principles_of_effective_feedback_transferable_across_disciplines_A_comparative_study_of_written_assignment_feedback_in_Languages_and_Technology","249393146_Emotions_in_SLA_New_Insights_From_Collaborative_Learning_for_an_EFL_Classroom","245577589_Autonomy_and_Foreign_Language_Learning","245543085_Cognitive_Psychology_and_Its_Implications","240730448_Editorial_The_New_Era_of_Mixed_Methods","233896787_Possible_selves","233088750_Connecting_With_the_Big_Picture","233055288_Why_autonomy_Insights_from_motivation_theory_and_research","232507577_Identity_context_and_interaction","228808388_Independent_language_learning_in_distance_education_Current_issues","222954838_Expectations_and_emergent_beliefs_of_self-instructed_language_learners","222227069_Anxiety_and_non-anxiety_in_a_distance_language_learning_environment_The_distance_factor_as_a_modifying_influence","220041901_Motivation_and_Education_The_Self-Determination_Perspective","216743170_The_What_and_Why_of_Goal_Pursuits_Human_Needs_and_the_Self-Determination_of_Behavior","43322921_Why_am_I_doing_this_Maintaining_motivation_in_distance_language_learning","42799611_Adult_beginner_distance_language_learner_perceptions_and_use_of_assignment_feedback","31380449_Metacognitive_Knowledge_and_Language_Learning1","31314353_'Being_the_Teacher'_Identity_and_Classroom_Conversation"]}
