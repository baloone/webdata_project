We formulate the localization problem as a constrained weighted least squares problem which is an indefinite quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem. Owing to the non-convex nature of this problem, it is difficult to obtain a global solution. However, by exploiting the hidden convexity of this problem, we reformulate it to a convex optimization problem. We further derive a primal-dual interior point algorithm to reach a global solution efficiently. The proposed method is shown to analytically achieve the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under some mild approximations. Moreover, when the location geometry is not desirable, the proposed algorithm can efficiently avoid the ill-conditioning problem. Simulations are used to corroborate the theoretical results which demonstrate the good performance, robustness and high efficiency of the proposed method.","authors":["Xiaomei Qu","Lihua Xie"],"meta":["February 2016Signal Processing 119:142-152","DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2015.08.001"],"references":["273412445_Localizing_multiple_audio_sources_in_a_wireless_acoustic_sensor_network","283234625_Source_localization_by_TDOA_with_random_sensor_position_errors_-_Part_I_Static_sensors","280798819_Statistical_Theory_of_Passive_Location_Systems","273021366_Recursive_source_localisation_by_time_difference_of_arrival_sensor_networks_with_sensor_position_uncertainty","263813452_Localization_of_Drag_Anchor_in_Mooring_Systems_Via_Magnetic_Induction_and_Acoustic_Wireless_Communication_Network","262288205_A_linear_combination-based_weighted_least_square_approach_for_target_localization_with_noisy_range_measurements","261674405_Target_localization_in_a_multi-static_passive_radar_system_through_convex_optimization","261075423_Source_localization_by_TDOA_with_random_sensor_position_errors_-_Part_II_Mobile_sensors","260637726_Bias_Reduction_for_an_Explicit_Solution_of_Source_Localization_Using_TDOA","256994431_A_new_constrained_weighted_least_squares_algorithm_for_TDOA-based_localization"]}
