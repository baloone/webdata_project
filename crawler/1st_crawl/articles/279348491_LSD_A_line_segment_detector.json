{"id":"279348491_LSD_A_line_segment_detector","abstract":"LSD is a linear-time Line Segment Detector giving subpixel accurate results. It is designed to work on any digital image without parameter tuning. It controls its own number of false detections: on average, one false alarm is allowed per image [1]. The method is based on Burns, Hanson, and Riseman's method [2], and uses an a contrario validation approach according to Desolneux, Moisan, and Morel's theory [3, 4]. The version described here includes some further improvement over the one described in our original article [1]. Source Code The ANSI C implementation of LSD version 1.6 is the one which has been peer reviewed and accepted by IPOL. The source code, the code documentation, and the online demo are accessible at the IPOL web page of this article 1. Supplementary Material Also available at the IPOL web page of this article 2 are two older implementations of LSD, versions 1.0 and 1.5, as well as an example of applying LSD, frame by frame, to a video. The version 1.0 of LSD code corresponds better to the algorithm described in our original article [1], and does not include the further improvements described here and included in the current version; they can be compiled, both, as a C language program or using the Megawave2 3 framework. Versions 1.0 and 1.5 of the code are non reviewed material.","authors":["Rafael Grompone von Gioi","Jeremie Jakubowicz","Jean-Michel Morel","Gregory Randall"],"meta":["March 2012Image Processing On Line 2(4):35-55","DOI:10.5201/ipol.2012.gjmr-lsd"],"references":["220146278_On_Straight_Line_Segment_Detection","41910459_LSD_A_Fast_Line_Segment_Detector_with_a_False_Detection_Control","267663982_From_Gestalt_Theory_to_Image_Analysis_A_Probabilistic_Approach","220660190_Meaningful_Alignments","220182636_Extracting_Straight_Lines"]}
