{"id":"336262852_Application_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_Health_Care_Safety_Context_Opportunities_and_Challenges","abstract":"There is a growing awareness that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in the analysis of complicated and big data to provide outputs without human input in various health care contexts, such as bioinformatics, genomics, and image analysis. Although this technology can provide opportunities in diagnosis and treatment processes, there still may be challenges and pitfalls related to various safety concerns. To shed light on such opportunities and challenges, this article reviews AI in health care along with its implication for safety. To provide safer technology through AI, this study shows that safe design, safety reserves, safe fail, and procedural safeguards are key strategies, whereas cost, risk, and uncertainty should be identified for all potential technical systems. It is also suggested that clear guidance and protocols should be identified and shared with all stakeholders to develop and adopt safer AI applications in the health care context.","authors":["Samer Ellahham","Nour Ellahham","Mecit Can Emre Simsekler"],"meta":["October 2019American Journal of Medical Quality","DOI:10.1177/1062860619878515","Projects: TelehealthArtificial Intelligence and Blockchain in Healthcare"],"references":["332236636_Are_innovation_and_new_technologies_in_precision_medicine_paving_a_new_era_in_patients_centric_care","331284730_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Black-Box_Medical_Decisions_Accuracy_versus_Explainability","330347947_Artificial_intelligence_bias_and_clinical_safety","330032069_Better_medicine_through_machine_learning_What's_real_and_what's_artificial","329622047_Artificial_intelligence_Which_services_which_applications_which_results_and_which_development_today_in_clinical_research_Which_impact_on_the_quality_of_care_Which_recommendations","328815849_Artificial_intelligence_for_the_detection_of_diabetic_retinopathy_in_primary_care_Research_Protocol_Preprint","331850333_Artificial_intelligence_in_breast_imaging","331740479_Medical_ethics_considerations_on_artificial_intelligence","331355443_Health_Care_in_2030_Will_Artificial_Intelligence_Replace_Physicians","329437320_Impact_of_Telemedicine_in_Pediatric_Postoperative_Care"]}
