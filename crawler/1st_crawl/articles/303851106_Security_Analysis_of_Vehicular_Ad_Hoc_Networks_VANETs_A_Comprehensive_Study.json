{"id":"303851106_Security_Analysis_of_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks_VANETs_A_Comprehensive_Study","abstract":"Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) is a technology that has been recently emerged, and brings a lot of research interests. Security is one of the important issues in VANET, it is considered a critical point in the development of robust VANET applications. In this paper, various dimensions of VANETs including its emerging applications, security issues, challenges, security threats and the existing solutions proposed by the different researchers are studied. Also author reviewed various type of VANET simulator available and presented possible key research area of VANETs.","authors":["Nirbhay Chaubey"],"meta":["May 2016International Journal of Security and its Applications 10(5):261-274","DOI:10.14257/ijsia.2016.10.5.25","Project: Security in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment"],"references":["271302406_A_Literature_Survey_on_Security_Challenges_in_VANETs","261095004_A_new_security_mechanism_for_vehicular_communication_networks","258248007_Vehicular_ad-Hoc_networks_VANETs-An_overview_and_challenges","280173175_Vehicular_communication_A_survey","271416534_A_new_anti-jamming_strategy_for_VANET_metrics-directed_security_defense","261457209_A_security_metric_for_VANET_content_delivery","261448545_Defensive_mechanism_for_VANET_security_in_game_theoretic_approach_using_heuristic_based_ant_colony_optimization","260739919_Survey_on_security_attacks_in_Vehicular_Ad_hoc_Networks_VANETs","234771859_Vehicular_Networks_Techniques_Standards_and_Applications","232635899_RBM_A_Role_Based_Mobility_Model_for_VANET"]}
