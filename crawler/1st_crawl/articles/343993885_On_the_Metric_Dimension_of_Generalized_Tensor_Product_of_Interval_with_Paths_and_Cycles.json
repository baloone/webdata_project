{"id":"343993885_On_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Tensor_Product_of_Interval_with_Paths_and_Cycles","abstract":"The concept of minimum resolving set for a connected graph has played a vital role in Robotic navigation, networking, and in computer sciences. In this article, we investigate the values of m and n for which P2⊗mPn and P2⊗mCn are connected and find metric dimension in this case. We also conclude that, for each m, we obtain a new regular family of constant metric dimension. We also give a basis for these graphs and presentation of resolving vector in general closed form with respect to the basis.","authors":["Song Li","Jia-Bao Liu","Mobeen Munir"],"meta":["August 2020Journal of Mathematics 2020(98):1-6","DOI:10.1155/2020/2168713"],"references":["328096023_Sharp_Bounds_for_partition_dimension_of_Generalized_Mobius_Ladder","326196178_Bounds_on_the_domination_number_and_the_metric_dimension_of_co-normal_product_of_graphs","265368560_Families_of_plane_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","264553656_Families_of_regular_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","277774195_ON_THREE_FAMILIES_OF_GRAPHS_WITH_CONSTANT_METRIC_DIMENSION","277096912_A_Note_on_Tensor_Product_of_Graphs","268766527_Remarks_on_Detection_Problems","265443592_Dominating_and_reference_sets_in_a_graph","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph"]}
