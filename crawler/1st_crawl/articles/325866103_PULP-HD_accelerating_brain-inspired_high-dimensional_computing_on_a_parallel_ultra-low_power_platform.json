{"id":"325866103_PULP-HD_accelerating_brain-inspired_high-dimensional_computing_on_a_parallel_ultra-low_power_platform","abstract":"Computing with high-dimensional (HD) vectors, also referred to as hypervectors, is a brain-inspired alternative to computing with scalars. Key properties of HD computing include a well-defined set of arithmetic operations on hypervectors, generality, scalability, robustness, fast learning, and ubiquitous parallel operations. HD computing is about manipulating and comparing large patterns---binary hypervectors with 10,000 dimensions---making its efficient realization on minimalistic ultra-low-power platforms challenging. This paper describes HD computing's acceleration and its optimization of memory accesses and operations on a silicon prototype of the PULPv3 4-core platform (1.5 mm², 2 mW), surpassing the state-of-the-art classification accuracy (on average 92.4%) with simultaneous 3.7× end-to-end speed-up and 2× energy saving compared to its single-core execution. We further explore the scalability of our accelerator by increasing the number of inputs and classification window on a new generation of the PULP architecture featuring bit-manipulation instruction extensions and larger number of 8 cores. These together enable a near ideal speed-up of 18.4× compared to the single-core PULPv3.","authors":["Fabio Montagna","Abbas Rahimi","Simone Benatti","Davide Rossi"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1145/3195970.3196096","Conference: the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference (DAC)At: San Francisco, CA.
