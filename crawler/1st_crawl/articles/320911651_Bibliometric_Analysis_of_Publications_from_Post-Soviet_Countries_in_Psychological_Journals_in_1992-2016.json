{"id":"320911651_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Publications_from_Post-Soviet_Countries_in_Psychological_Journals_in_1992-2016","abstract":"During several decades Soviet academic psychology community was isolated from the West, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union each of the 15 countries went its own way in economic, social, and scientific development. The paper analyses publications from post-Soviet countries in psychological journals in 1992-2016, i.e. 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Results show that 15 post-Soviet countries have produced in sum less than one percent from the world output in psychological journals. There is a huge diversity in the number of papers between 15 post-Soviet countries. Russia, Estonia, and Lithuania are the leaders among them. Authors of the more than 90% of all post-Soviet countries' papers are affiliated with these three countries. The most intensive collaboration is between Russia, Estonia, Lithuania, and Georgia and between three Baltic countries. Post-Soviet countries also differ in publication patterns.","authors":["Andrey Lovakov","Elena Agadullina"],"meta":["October 2017","Conference: 16th International Conference on Scientometrics & InformetricsAt: Wuhan, China"],"references":["289327974_Regarding_the_isolationism_of_the_soviet_psychology_Scientific_publications_of_the_1920s_and_1930s","286963364_Regarding_the_isolationism_of_Soviet_psychology_International_conferences_in_the_1920-1930s","282003672_Computer_science_in_Eastern_Europe_1989-2014_A_bibliometric_study","276857280_Implications_of_project-based_funding_of_research_on_budgeting_and_financial_management_in_public_universities","270344335_Comparative_analysis_of_the_scientific_output_of_Armenia_Azerbaijan_and_Georgia","305075696_Influence_of_the_program_5-top_100_on_the_publication_activity_of_Russian_universities","283096201_Progress_in_Estonian_science","281345608_Ggplot2_Elegant_Graphics_for_Data_Analysis","274015857_Team_RDCR_A_Language_And_Environment_For_Statistical_Computing_R_Foundation_for_Statistical_Computing_Vienna_Austria","267933221_After_the_Berlin_Wall_Central_Europe_up_close","259239696_How_have_the_Eastern_European_countries_of_the_former_Warsaw_Pact_developed_since_1990_A_bibliometric_study","228079436_The_100_Most_Eminent_Psychologists_of_the_20th_Century","221995787_The_Igraph_Software_Package_for_Complex_Network_Research","237461352_Quality_of_Estonian_science_estimated_through_bibliometric_indicators_1997-2007","226876232_Bibliometric_indicators_of_Russian_Science_and_of_the_Russian_Academy_of_Sciences_1997-2007"]}
