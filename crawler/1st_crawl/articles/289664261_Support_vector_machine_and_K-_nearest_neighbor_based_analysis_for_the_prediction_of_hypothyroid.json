{"id":"289664261_Support_vector_machine_and_K-_nearest_neighbor_based_analysis_for_the_prediction_of_hypothyroid","abstract":"The thyroid gland produces two important hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). These hormones contain in the blood and control many undertakings in human bodies. Calories burning, heartbeats are supervised by T3 and T4. This is called human body metabolism. The thyroid, which is in good condition, produces as required amounts of hormones for the function of good mechanism of metabolism. The thyroid illness mostly affects women than men. Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism are the two levels of thyroid malfunction. In data mining, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and KNearest Neighbor (KNN) are the two important modes applied to the prediction of hypothyroid. This paper discusses that predictions of Hypothyroid using K- Nearest Neighbor better than the Support Vector Machine.","authors":["K.
