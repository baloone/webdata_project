{"id":"222670011_Incorporating_interactive_3-dimensional_graphics_in_astronomy_research_papers","abstract":"Most research data collections created or used by astronomers are intrinsically multi-dimensional. In contrast, all visual representations of data presented within research papers are exclusively two-dimensional (2D). We present a resolution of this dichotomy that uses a novel technique for embedding three-dimensional (3D) visualisations of astronomy data sets in electronic-format research papers. Our technique uses the latest Adobe Portable Document Format extensions together with a new version of the S2PLOT programming library. The 3D models can be easily rotated and explored by the reader and, in some cases, modified. We demonstrate example applications of this technique including: 3D figures exhibiting subtle structure in redshift catalogues, colour-magnitude diagrams and halo merger trees; 3D isosurface and volume renderings of cosmological simulations; and 3D models of instructional diagrams and instrument designs.","authors":["David G.
