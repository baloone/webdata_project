{"id":"301551223_Use_of_dissertation_data_in_science_policy_research","abstract":"Although the contribution of scientometric literature to policies on academic science has been substantial, the literature has focused primarily on the production of scientific knowledge, whereas limited attention has been paid to the other critical mission of academic institutions, i.e., education or the production of scientists. To address this limitation and better inform policymakers, the current study proposes a new approach drawing on PhD dissertation data, which we believe should open up a new avenue of scientometric research. Integrating dissertation data with more traditional types of scientometric data such as publications and careers, this study presents a case study of the Japanese science system investigating its transition since the 1970s.","authors":["Noriyuki Morichika","Sotaro Shibayama"],"meta":["April 2016Scientometrics 108(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-016-1962-x"],"references":["270897026_Impact_of_Inbreeding_on_Scientific_Productivity_a_Case_Study_of_a_Japanese_University_Department","269517306_Organizational_Design_of_University_Laboratories_Task_Allocation_and_Lab_Performance_in_Japanese_Bioscience_Laboratories","261103742_Research_Teaching_and_Publication_Productivity_Mutuality_Versus_Competition_in_Academia","257663155_Doctoral_Dissertations_of_Library_and_Information_Science_in_China_A_Co-word_Analysis","344486804_How_Economics_Shapes_Science","329355457_Working_in_the_Lab_Social_Organization_of_Research_and_Training_in_Biomedical_Research_Labs_in_Canada_and_its_Relationship_to_Research_Funding","285527110_The_Changing_Governance_of_Japanese_Public_Science","257663026_Time_series_of_scientific_growth_in_Spanish_doctoral_theses_1848-2009","251503144_Performance-Based_University_Research_Funding_Systems","250198917_Using_curriculum_vitae_to_compare_some_impacts_of_NSF_research_grants_with_research_Center_funding"]}
