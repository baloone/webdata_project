The implementation of the task is realized by a neural network that solves logical function. At the beginning it has been viewed a standard implementation of searching route in the maze and listed the results it gives. Subsequently viewed modify this algorithm. Based on road map of northern Bulgaria is made a presentation by predicates in the middle of logic programming. To this presentation is implemented neural network, which is conducive to finding the most - relevant route between the two cities entered by the user. The article analyzes the results neural network routing based on the system as well as the possible advantages and disadvantages of such an approach.","authors":["Elitsa Spasova"],"meta":["February 2017International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 15(2):140-144"],"references":[]}
