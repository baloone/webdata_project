{"id":"28641142_Factoring_Integers_with_Elliptic_Curves","abstract":"This paper is devoted to the description and analysis of a new algorithm to factor positive integers. It depends on the use of elliptic curves. The new method is obtained from J. M. Pollard’s p-1-method [Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 76, 521-528 (1974; Zbl 0294.10005)] by replacing the multiplicative group by the group of points on a random elliptic curve. It is conjectured that the algorithm determines a non-trivial divisor of a composite number n in expected time at most K(p)(log n) 2 , where p is the least prime dividing n and K is a function for which logK(x)=(2+o(1))logxloglogxforx→∞· In the worst case, when n is the product of two primes of the same order of magnitude, this is exp((1+o(1))lognloglogn(forn→∞)· There are several other factoring algorithms of which the conjectural expected running time is given by the latter formula. However, these algorithms have a running time that is basically independent of the size of the prime factors of n, whereas the new elliptic curve method is substantially faster for small p.","authors":["H.W.
