SAIL-SB has the potential to transform education by empowering transdisciplinary knowledge acquisition. This is particularly important in fields that accepts newcomers with diverse scholastic backgrounds, e.g. Systems Biology. With traditional interdisciplinary instruction, the instructor must cover pre-requisite information from multiple disciplines to ensure all students begin at a common baseline - slowing the learning process. With SAIL, students follow a personalized syllabus based on their previous knowledge and work towards individual goals. Implementing an adaptive learning system in an interdisciplinary course requires careful considerations of the instructional design. Structuring material, developing interest-based goals, formulating assessments, and other instructional design aspects must be carefully considered. This paper introduces SAIL and explores SAIL-SB, a case study implementing SAIL in a graduate level Systems Biology course.","authors":["Karen Aguar","Charles C.
