{"id":"302977849_New_Talent_Signals_Shiny_New_Objects_or_a_Brave_New_World","abstract":"Almost 20 years after McKinsey introduced the idea of a war for talent, technology is disrupting the talent identification industry. From smartphone profiling apps to workplace big data, the digital revolution has produced a wide range of new tools for making quick and cheap inferences about human potential and predicting future work performance. However, academic industrialâ€“organizational (I-O) psychologists appear to be mostly spectators. Indeed, there is little scientific research on innovative assessment methods, leaving human resources (HR) practitioners with no credible evidence to evaluate the utility of such tools. To this end, this article provides an overview of new talent identification tools, using traditional workplace assessment methods as the organizing framework for classifying and evaluating new tools, which are largely technologically enhanced versions of traditional methods. We highlight some opportunities and challenges for I-O psychology practitioners interested in exploring and improving these innovations.","authors":["Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic","David Winsborough","Ryne A Sherman","Robert Hogan"],"meta":["May 2016Industrial and Organizational Psychology -1(3):1-20","DOI:10.1017/iop.2016.6"],"references":["284689712_The_War_for_Talent","283803351_The_Validity_and_Utility_of_Selection_Methods_in_Personnel_Psychology_Practical_and_Theoretical_Implications_of_85_Years_of_Research_Findings","281621604_Facebook_as_a_Research_Tool_for_the_Social_Sciences","278652565_Predicting_Personality_Using_Novel_Mobile_Phone-Based_Metrics","276054647_Reversing_the_Extraverted_Leadership_Advantage_The_Role_of_Employee_Proactivity","318393770_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","288860597_What_job_attitudes_tell_about_motivation","287245639_The_psychology_of_personnel_selection","281289888_Social_Computing_Behavioral-Cultural_Modeling_and_Prediction_6th_International_Conference_SBP_2013_Washington_DC_USA_April_2-5_2013_Proceedings","279673524_Predictors_of_job_seekers'_self-disclosure_on_social_media"]}
