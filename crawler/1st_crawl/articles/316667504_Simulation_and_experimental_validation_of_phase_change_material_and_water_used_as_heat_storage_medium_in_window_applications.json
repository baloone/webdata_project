{"id":"316667504_Simulation_and_experimental_validation_of_phase_change_material_and_water_used_as_heat_storage_medium_in_window_applications","abstract":"Performances of two different materials (water and phase change material) were studied as heat storage medium in passive design of buildings. An experimental and numerical simulation method was applied. The experimental study was conducted in the laboratory environment on double glazed window sample. Numerical simulation model was formulated to simulate the transient heat transfer through the window system. The results show that the PCM filled window can be protected from rapid overheating due to latent heat of the phase change material. Numerical model showed good matching with experiment; therefore, the model can be used for the window system performance evaluation as energy storage unit under different configurations.","authors":["Benjamin Durakovic","Muris Torlak"],"meta":["January 2017Journal of Materials and Environmental Science 8(5):1837-1846"],"references":[]}
