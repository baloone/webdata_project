{"id":"270905908_Computational_Fact_Checking_from_Knowledge_Networks","abstract":"Traditional fact checking by expert journalists cannot keep up with the\nenormous volume of information that is now generated online. Computational fact\nchecking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate the veracity of\ndubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human fact checking\ncan be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path between concept\nnodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on knowledge graphs.\nFramed as a network problem this approach is feasible with efficient\ncomputational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens of\nthousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and\nbiographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from\nWikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive\nhigher support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a\nsignificant step toward scalable computational fact-checking methods that may\none day mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation.","authors":["Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia","Prashant Shiralkar","Luis M.
