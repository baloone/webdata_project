{"id":"325400392_Electrical_Resistance_Tomography_for_Visualization_of_Moving_Objects_Using_a_Spatiotemporal_Total_Variation_Regularization_Algorithm","abstract":"Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) has been considered as a data collection and image reconstruction method in many multi-phase flow application areas due to its advantages of high speed, low cost and being non-invasive. In order to improve the quality of the reconstructed images, the Total Variation algorithm attracts abundant attention due to its ability to solve large piecewise and discontinuous conductivity distributions. In industrial processing tomography (IPT), techniques such as ERT have been used to extract important flow measurement information. For a moving object inside a pipe, a velocity profile can be calculated from the cross correlation between signals generated from ERT sensors. Many previous studies have used two sets of 2D ERT measurements based on pixel-pixel cross correlation, which requires two ERT systems. In this paper, a method for carrying out flow velocity measurement using a single ERT system is proposed. A novel spatiotemporal total variation regularization approach is utilised to exploit sparsity both in space and time in 4D, and a voxel-voxel cross correlation method is adopted for measurement of flow profile. Result shows that the velocity profile can be calculated with a single ERT system and that the volume fraction and movement can be monitored using the proposed method. Both semi-dynamic experimental and static simulation studies verify the suitability of the proposed method. For in plane velocity profile, a 3D image based on temporal 2D images produces velocity profile with accuracy of less than 1% error and a 4D image for 3D velocity profiling shows an error of 4%.","authors":["Bo Chen","Juan F P J Abascal","Manuchehr Soleimani"],"meta":["May 2018Sensors 18(6):1704","DOI:10.3390/s18061704"],"references":["306907234_Quantitative_electrical_imaging_of_three-dimensional_moisture_flow_in_cement-based_materials","306388541_Three-Dimensional_Electrical_Impedance_Tomography_to_Monitor_Unsaturated_Moisture_Ingress_in_Cement-Based_Materials","267547561_Comparison_of_Total_Variation_with_a_Motion_Estimation_Based_Compressed_Sensing_Approach_for_Self-Gated_Cardiac_Cine_MRI_in_Small_Animal_Studies","306025703_Measurement_of_velocity_of_gassolid_swirl_flow_using_Electrical_Capacitance_Tomography_and_cross_correlation_technique","288927245_An_iterative_regularization_method_for_total_variation-based_image_restoration","285920969_Applied_Potential_Tomography_APT_-_A_New_Technique_for_Monitoring_Lung_Function","284991920_Crosscorrelation_flowmeters","283176707_ITS_Reconstruction_Tool-Suite_An_inverse_algorithm_package_for_industrial_process_tomography","262113443_Evaluation_of_fringe_effect_of_electrical_resistance_tomography_sensor","257535292_Application_of_the_Compressed_Sensing_Technique_to_Self-Gated_Cardiac_Cine_Sequences_in_Small_Animals","244418126_An_Iterative_Regularization_Method_for_Total_Variation-Based_Image_Restoration","238857804_Split_Bregman_iteration_algorithm_for_total_bounded_variation_regularization_based_image_deblurring","236627342_Direct_Image_Reconstruction_for_3-D_Electrical_Resistance_Tomography_by_Using_the_Factorization_Method_and_Electrodes_on_a_Single_Plane","245218609_Application_of_dual-plane_ERT_system_and_cross-correlation_technique_to_measure_gas-liquid_flows_in_vertical_upward_pipe","239981253_Existence_and_Uniqueness_for_Electrode_Models_for_Electric_Current_Computed_Tomography"]}
