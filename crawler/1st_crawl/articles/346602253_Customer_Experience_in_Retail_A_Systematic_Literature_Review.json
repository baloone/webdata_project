{"id":"346602253_Customer_Experience_in_Retail_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"The customer experience (CX) is a concept that has been closely studied by companies in recent years. This is because it is one of the most important factors in maintaining a competitive advantage. In addition, it is customers who seek to create an experience that goes beyond the acquisition of a product. In this article, we present a systematic literature review of the CX in retail. We reviewed articles published over the last ten years related to (1) the definition of the CX; (2) dimensions, attributes, and factors that influence the CX in retail; (3) methods used to evaluate the CX in retail; and (4) potential heuristics to evaluate the CX in general and, in particular, in retail. We analyzed 67 articles, and the obtained result shows that (1) multiple definitions exist in different contexts; (2) the dimensions, such as the conceptualization of the CX, vary depending on the context; (3) the evaluation methods found do not comprehensively evaluate the CX; (4) there is no evidence of heuristics used to evaluate the CX.","authors":["Camila Bascur","Cristian Rusu"],"meta":["October 2020Applied Sciences 10(21):7644","DOI:10.3390/app10217644"],"references":["339604307_Negative_and_positive_customer_shopping_experience_in_an_online_context","338555044_Customer_experience_fundamental_premises_and_implications_for_research","338312113_Examining_the_Channel_Choice_of_Experience-Oriented_Customers_in_Omni-Channel_Retailing","347133330_Brand_Experience_What_is_It_How_is_it_Measured_Does_it_Affect_Loyalty","344324965_Building_Great_Customer_Experiences","340822032_Designing_an_Omni-Experience_to_Save_Retailing_Lessons_from_an_Italian_Book_Retailer","338970691_Conceptualization_of_omnichannel_customer_experience_and_its_impact_on_shopping_intention_A_mixed-method_approach","337696823_An_omnichannel_approach_to_retailing_demystifying_and_identifying_the_factors_influencing_an_omnichannel_experience","337318394_A_Bayesian_examination_of_the_relationship_of_internal_and_external_touchpoints_in_the_customer_experience_process_across_various_service_environments","336958304_The_reinforcing_and_aversive_consequences_of_customer_experience_The_role_of_consumer_confusion"]}
