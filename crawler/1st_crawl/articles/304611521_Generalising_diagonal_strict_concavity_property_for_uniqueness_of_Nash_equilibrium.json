{"id":"304611521_Generalising_diagonal_strict_concavity_property_for_uniqueness_of_Nash_equilibrium","abstract":"In this paper, we extend the notion of diagonally strictly concave functions and use it to provide a sufficient condition for uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in some concave games. We then provide an alternative proof of the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for a network resource allocation game arising from the so-called Kelly mechanism by verifying the new sufficient condition. We then establish that the equilibrium resulting from the differential pricing in the Kelly mechanism is related to a normalised Nash equilibrium of a game with coupled strategy space.","authors":["Eitan Altman","Manjesh K.
