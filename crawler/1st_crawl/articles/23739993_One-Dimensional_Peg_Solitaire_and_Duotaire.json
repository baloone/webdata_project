{"id":"23739993_One-Dimensional_Peg_Solitaire_and_Duotaire","abstract":"We solve the problem of one-dimensional Peg Solitaire. In particular, we show that the set of configurations that can be reduced to a single peg forms a regular language, and that a linear-time algorithm exists for reducing any configuration to the minimum number of pegs. We then look at the impartial two-player game, proposed by Ravikumar, where two players take turns making peg moves, and whichever player is left without a move loses. We calculate some simple nim-values and discuss when the game separates into a disjunctive sum of smaller games. In the version where a series of hops can be made in a single move, we show that neither the $\\cal P$-positions nor the $\\cal N$-positions (i.e. wins for the previous or next player) are described by a regular or context-free language.","authors":["Cristopher Moore","David Eppstein"],"meta":["August 2000","SourceRePEc"],"references":["244999849_PC-automata_and_classes_of_context-free_languages","37689113_The_Unexpected_Hanging_and_Other_Mathematical_Diversions"]}
