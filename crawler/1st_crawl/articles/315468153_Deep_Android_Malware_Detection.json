{"id":"315468153_Deep_Android_Malware_Detection","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel android malware detection system that uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Malware classification is performed based on static analysis of the raw opcode sequence from a disassembled program. Features indicative of malware are automatically learned by the network from the raw opcode sequence thus removing the need for hand-engineered malware features. The training pipeline of our proposed system is much simpler than existing n-gram based malware detection methods, as the network is trained end-to-end to jointly learn appropriate features and to perform classification, thus removing the need to explicitly enumerate millions of n-grams during training. The network design also allows the use of long n-gram like features, not computationally feasible with existing methods. Once trained, the network can be efficiently executed on a GPU, allowing a very large number of files to be scanned quickly.","authors":["Niall McLaughlin","Adam Doup√©","Gail Joon Ahn","Jesus Martinez-del-Rincon"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1145/3029806.3029823","Conference: the Seventh ACM"],"references":["312721061_Mining_API_Calls_and_Permissions_for_Android_Malware_Detection","308838809_DeepSign_Deep_Learning_for_Automatic_Malware_Signature_Generation_and_Classification","284435096_Android_Malware_Detection_an_Eigenspace_Analysis_Approach","281607724_Character-level_Convolutional_Networks_for_Text_Classification","279952978_Mobile_Malware_Detection_using_Op-code_Frequency_Histograms","276158407_High_Accuracy_Android_Malware_Detection_Using_Ensemble_Learning","308830620_Malware_classification_with_recurrent_networks","304410078_Deep_neural_network_based_malware_detection_using_two_dimensional_binary_program_features","282906526_A_Sensitivity_Analysis_of_and_Practitioners'_Guide_to_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification","280970126_Deep_Neural_Network_Based_Malware_Detection_Using_Two_Dimensional_Binary_Program_Features"]}
