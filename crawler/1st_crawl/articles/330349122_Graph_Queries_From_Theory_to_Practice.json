{"id":"330349122_Graph_Queries_From_Theory_to_Practice","abstract":"We review various graph query language fragments that are both theoretically tractable and practically relevant. We focus on the most expressive one that retains these properties and use it as a stepping stone to examine the underpinnings of graph query evaluation along graph view maintenance. Further broadening the scope of the discussion, we then consider alternative processing techniques for graph queries, based on graph summarization and path query learning. We conclude by pinpointing the open research directions in this emerging area.","authors":["Angela Bonifati","Stefania Dumbrava"],"meta":["December 2018ACM SIGMOD Record 47(4)","DOI:10.1145/3335409.3335411"],"references":["334898269_An_analytical_study_of_large_SPARQL_query_logs","326943873_Certified_Graph_View_Maintenance_with_Regular_Datalog","345492961_An_analytical_study_of_large_SPARQL_query_logs","336570030_Dichotomies_for_Evaluating_Simple_Regular_Path_Queries","327706504_Query-Based_Linked_Data_Anonymization_17th_International_Semantic_Web_Conference_Monterey_CA_USA_October_8-12_2018_Proceedings_Part_I","325591758_Bridging_the_GAP_towards_approximate_graph_analytics","320280113_Enumeration_Problems_for_Regular_Path_Queries","320074732_Foundations_of_Modern_Query_Languages_for_Graph_Databases","318849581_An_analytical_study_of_large_SPARQL_query_logs","317072869_gMark_Schema-Driven_Generation_of_Graphs_and_Queries"]}
