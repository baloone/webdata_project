{"id":"319600362_Topological_Characterization_of_Carbon_Graphite_and_Crystal_Cubic_Carbon_Structures","abstract":"Graph theory is used for modeling, designing, analysis and understanding chemical structures or chemical networks and their properties. The molecular graph is a graph consisting of atoms called vertices and the chemical bond between atoms called edges. In this article, we study the chemical graphs of carbon graphite and crystal structure of cubic carbon. Moreover, we compute and give closed formulas of degree based additive topological indices, namely hyper-Zagreb index, first multiple and second multiple Zagreb indices, and first and second Zagreb polynomials.","authors":["Muhammad Kamran Siddiqui","Muhammad Naeem","Najma Abdul Rehman"],"meta":["September 2017Molecules 22(9):1496","DOI:10.3390/molecules22091496"],"references":["318175922_Computing_the_Ediz_eccentric_connectivity_index_of_discrete_dynamic_structures","316816643_Characteristics_studies_of_molecular_structures_in_drugs","316567849_The_first_multiplication_atom-bond_connectivity_index_of_molecular_structures_in_drugs","313372856_Molecular_Descriptors_of_Nanotube_Oxide_Silicate_and_Triangulene_Networks","311912553_Some_results_on_topological_indices_of_graphene","309429188_Computing_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","316665321_On_Zagreb_Indices_Zagreb_Polynomials_of_Mesh_Derived_Networks","315057831_Molecular_Description_of_Carbon_Graphite_and_Crystal_Cubic_Carbon_Structures","311556865_Handbook_of_Carbon_Graphite_Diamonds_and_Fullerenes_Processing_Properties_and_Applications","310314738_On_Zagreb_Indices_Zagreb_Polynomials_of_Nanocone_and_Nanotubes"]}
