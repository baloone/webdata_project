{"id":"228541994_MonetDB_a_novel_spatial_column-store_DBMS","abstract":"Column-store database engines are a promising track in database research to handle data warehouses. In this paper we describe our experiences in extending the open-source database management system MonetDB with geo-spatial functionality. The approach taken is to leverage the existing geo-spatial software library GEOS through the extensibility features of this DBMS. The result is a high-performance solution using a software stack that enables future research and development improvements in many directions. In our paper we first give an overview of the MonetDB architecture then we describe how this architecture is beneficial for the handling of spatial data.","authors":["Maarten Vermeij","Wilko Quak","Martin Kersten","Niels Nes"],"meta":[],"references":["222682924_Lossless_compression_of_predicted_floating-point_geometry"]}
