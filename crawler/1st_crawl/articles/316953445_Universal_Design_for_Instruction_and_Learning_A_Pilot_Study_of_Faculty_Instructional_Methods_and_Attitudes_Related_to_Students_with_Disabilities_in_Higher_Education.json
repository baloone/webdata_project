{"id":"316953445_Universal_Design_for_Instruction_and_Learning_A_Pilot_Study_of_Faculty_Instructional_Methods_and_Attitudes_Related_to_Students_with_Disabilities_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"Universal design in the education setting is a framework of instruction that aims to be inclusive of different learners to reduce barriers for all students, including those with disabilities. We used the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL focuses on the learner) and Universal Design for Instruction (UDI focuses on instruction) as the basis for this study. The purposes of this study were to determine if faculty were incorporating UDI/UDL into their instruction, and their attitudes toward students with disabilities, as these could be barriers to learning. The study revealed that some faculty were incorporating principles of UDI/UDL into their instruction, the variety of methods used varied, and faculty attitudes still create barriers to an equitable educational environment for students with disabilities. More education and training is needed in working with students with disabilities and adapting teaching methods for these students using UDI/UDL.","authors":["R David Black","Lois Weinberg","Martin G Brodwin"],"meta":["April 2014Exceptionality Education International 24(1):48-64","DOI:10.5206/eei.v24i1.7710"],"references":[]}
