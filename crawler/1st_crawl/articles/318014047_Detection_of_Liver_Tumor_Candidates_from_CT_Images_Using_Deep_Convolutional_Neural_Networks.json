{"id":"318014047_Detection_of_Liver_Tumor_Candidates_from_CT_Images_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"There are multiple types of tumors occurring in the liver. Different tumors have different visual appearance and their visual appearance changes after injection of the contrast medium. So detection of liver tumors is considered as a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for detection of liver tumor candidates from CT images using a deep convolutional neural network. Experimental results show that we can significantly improve the detection accuracy by using our proposed method compared with the previous researches.","authors":["Yoshihiro Todoroki","Xian-Hua Han","Yutaro Iwamoto","Lanfen Lin"],"meta":["May 2018Smart Innovation","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-59397-5_15","Conference: International Conference on Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare"],"references":["277889213_Diagnosis_of_Liver_Tumor_from_CT_Images_Using_First_Order_Statistical_Features","221923839_Liver_Tumor_Detection_in_CT_Images_by_Adaptive_Contrast_Enhancement_and_the_EMMPM_Algorithm","216792820_Convolutional_Networks_for_Images_Speech_and_Time-Series","313001289_Neural_network_based_texture_analysis_of_liver_tumor_from_computed_tomography_images","306211942_Neural_Network_based_Texture_Analysis_of_Liver_Tumor_from_Computed_Tomography_Images","303791048_Bayesian_Model_for_Liver_Tumor_Enhancement","298328959_Simultaneous_Segmentation_of_Multiple_Organs_Using_Random_Walks","284359842_Improved_segmentation_of_low-contrast_lesions_using_sigmoid_edge_model","283472772_Segmentation_of_Liver_and_Spleen_based_on_Computational_Anatomy_Models","221126315_Liver_Tumor_Detection_in_CT_Images_by_Adaptive_Contrast_Enhancement_and_the_EMMPM_Algorithm","220858263_Automatic_Hepatic_Tumor_Segmentation_Using_Statistical_Optimal_Threshold"]}
