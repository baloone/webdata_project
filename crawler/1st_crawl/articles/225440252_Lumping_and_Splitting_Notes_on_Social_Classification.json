{"id":"225440252_Lumping_and_Splitting_Notes_on_Social_Classification","abstract":"This paper examines the mental process of grouping “similar” things together in distinct clusters and separating “different”\nclusters from one another. The role language plays in providing us with seemingly homogeneous mental niches for lumping things\ntogether yet at the same time allowing us to carve seemingly discrete categories out of experiential continua directs the\nsociological study of classification to intersubjective, conventional mindscapes that are neither personal nor “logical.”\nThe paper identifies a nonmetric, topological mode of thinking that involves playing down intracluster while exaggerating\nintercluster mental distances and ends with some methodological observations of the need to approach classification from a\ncomparative perspective as well as highlighting the role of spatial zoning, rites of separation, and Freudian slips in the\nstudy of the social construction of difference and similarity.","authors":["Eviatar Zerubavel"],"meta":["September 1996Sociological Forum 11(3):421-433","DOI:10.1007/BF02408386"],"references":["332637098_Principles_of_Animal_Taxonomy","323321266_On_collective_memory","312940597_The_Pre-eminence_of_the_Right_Hand_A_Study_in_Religious_Polarity","298874792_Language_mind_and_reality","288256918_Clustering_and_Classification_Background_and_Current_Directions","285607278_Cultural_Entrepreneurship_in_Nineteenth-Century_Boston_Part_II_The_Classification_and_Framing_of_American_Art","284773931_Taxonomy_as_politics_The_harm_of_false_classification","280015706_The_Rigid_the_Fuzzy_and_the_Flexible_Notes_on_the_Mental_Sculpting_of_Academic_Identity","275618024_Recovered_Roots_Collective_Memory_and_the_Making_of_Israeli_National_Tradition","274043488_Social_Boundary_Systems","273264299_Categories_and_Concepts","270900884_Ulysses'_Sail_An_Ethnographic_Odyssey_of_Power_Knowledge_and_Geographical_Distance","270354776_Principles_of_Animal_Taxonomy","270012038_Forty_The_Age_and_the_Symbol","268026449_Animals_Are_Good_to_Think_and_Good_to_Prohibit","265012834_An_Essay_Concerning_Humane_Understanding","263809355_Structures_in_the_Subjective_Lexicon","261948365_The_Genesis_and_Development_of_a_Scientific_Fact","259255638_Patterns_of_Time_in_Hospital_Life_A_Sociological_Perspective","254734128_Abstract_and_Concrete_Behavior_An_Experimental_Study_With_Special_Tests","249986450_From_Swinging_Hard_to_Rocking_Out_Classification_of_Style_and_the_Creation_of_Identity_in_the_World_of_Drumming","246399263_Human_Groups_and_Social_Categories","243777080_The_psychopathology_of_everyday_life","243632993_Untersuchung_zur_Lehre_von_der_Gestalt_II","242474773_The_Social_Construction_Of_Reality_A_Treatise_In_The_Sociology_Of_Knowledge","240567908_On_Social_Boundary_Systems","238737163_Kinesics_and_context_Essays_on_body_motion_communication","235362923_Animal_Liberation_A_New_Ethic_for_Our_Treatment_of_Animals","232574635_A_developmental_perspective_on_the_effects_of_subdividing_macrospatial_experience","232549691_A_multidimensional_scaling_study_of_semantic_distance","232490480_Concerning_the_applicability_of_geometric_models_to_similarity_data_The_interrelationship_between_similarity_and_spatial_density","232478890_Content_of_stereotypes_and_the_inference_of_similarity_between_members_of_stereotyped_groups","232449846_Intimate_Relations","232326708_Pattern_Recognition_and_Categorization","226992842_Introduction_Challenges_to_the_homogenization_of_African_American","226185006_Movement_and_structure_as_determinants_of_spatial_representations","224105009_On_Some_Clustering_Techniques","223862310_Distance_Estimation_from_Cognitive_Maps","222438571_Subjective_structures_and_operations_in_semantic_memory","215439343_The_Social_Construction_of_Reality_A_Treatise_in_the_Sociology_of_Knowlege","215057558_The_American_Occupational_Structure","200772373_Common_Fate_Similarity_and_other_Indices_of_the_Status_of_Aggregates_of_Persons_as_Social_Entities","200026806_An_Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding","200026378_The_Order_of_Things_An_Archaeology_of_the_Human_Sciences","49302201_The_Comparative_Psychology_of_Mental_Development","49301332_Principles_of_topological_psychology_New_York_McGraw","37711717_Cognitive_development_Its_cultural_and_social_foundations","31805228_The_Elementary_Forms_of_The_Religious_Life","24061847_Hierarchial_Clustering_Schemes","24061768_Multidimensional_Scaling_of_Similarity","21888355_An_inquiry_into_the_process_of_temporal_orientation","22441822_Distortions_in_Judged_Spatial_Relations","19021580_Cognitive_Maps_in_Children_and_Men","16450543_Effects_of_hierarchical_organization_on_children's_judgments_of_distance_and_direction","16078321_Why_Do_Categorization_Effects_Occur_in_Comparative_Judgement_Tasks"]}
