{"id":"250755297_Validity_Foundational_Issues_and_Statistical_Methodology","abstract":"This chapter highlights some foundational and statistical issues involved in validity theory and validation practice. It discusses several foundational issues focusing on several observations about the current state of affairs in validity theory and practice, introducing a new framework for considering the bounds and limitations of the measurement inferences. It also discusses the distinction between measures and indices. The chapter deals with two statistical methods—variable ordering and latent variable regression—and introduces a methodology for variable-ordering in latent variable regression models in validity research. Measurement or test score validation is an ongoing process wherein an evidence to support the appropriateness, meaningfulness, and usefulness of the speciﬁc inferences made from scores about individuals from a given sample and in a given context is provided. The concept, method, and processes of validation are central to constructing and evaluating measures used in the social, behavioral, health, and human sciences because without validation any inferences made from a measure are potentially meaningless, inappropriate, and of limited usefulness.","authors":["Bruno D Zumbo"],"meta":["January 2007Handbook of Statistics
