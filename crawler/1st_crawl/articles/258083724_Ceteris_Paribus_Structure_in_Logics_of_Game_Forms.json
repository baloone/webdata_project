{"id":"258083724_Ceteris_Paribus_Structure_in_Logics_of_Game_Forms","abstract":"The article introduces a ceteris paribus modal logic interpreted on the\nequivalence classes induced by sets of propositional atoms. This logic is used\nto embed two logics of agency and games, namely atemporal STIT and the\ncoalition logic of propositional control (CL-PC). The embeddings highlight a\ncommon ceteris paribus structure underpinning the key modal operators of both\nlogics, they clarify the relationship between STIT and CL-PC, and enable the\ntransfer of complexity results to the ceteris paribus logic.","authors":["Davide Grossi","Emiliano Lorini","Fran√ßois Schwarzentruber"],"meta":["October 2013Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 53","DOI:10.1613/jair.4666","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257666858_On_axiomatizations_of_public_announcement_logic","257666092_Complexity_Results_of_STIT_Fragments","292228989_Making_Things_Happen","275728496_Trying_As_the_Mental_Pineal_Gland","274199005_The_Logic_of_Preference_An_Essay","273109590_Volition_and_Basic_Action","266524057_Modal_Logic","261165149_Dynamic_Logic_of_Propositional_Assignments_A_Well-Behaved_Variant_of_PDL","259810884_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","251467769_Hybrid_Logics"]}
