{"id":"285343105_Beth's_Theorem_and_Self-Referential_Sentences","abstract":"This chapter discusses Beth's theorem and self-referential sentences. This chapter presents a new proof of Beth's theorem. This theorem is most conveniently stated in the notation of modal logic and is best viewed as a theorem about modal logic. The Interpolation Theorem for L is proved and Beth's Theorem is obtained from it. The Interpolation Theorem is model-theoretic and is based on R. Solovay's proof of the completeness theorem for L with respect to Kripke models. This is followed by de Jongh's proof of the existence and uniqueness result. The classes of self-referential sentences considered in the chapter are those that correspond to fixed-points of appropriate modal functions. The proof in the chapter is a pure existence proof and does not result in an actual explicit definition of the fixed-point.","authors":["C.
