{"id":"340538707_What_Researchers_are_Currently_Saying_about_Ontologies_A_Review_of_Recent_Web_of_Science_Articles","abstract":"Traditionally connected to Philosophy, the term ontology is increasingly related to information systems areas. Some researchers consider the approaches of the two disciplinary contexts to be completely different. Others consider that, although different, they should talk to each other, as both seek to answer similar questions. With the extensive literature on this topic, we intend to contribute to the understanding of the use of the term ontology in current research and which references support this use. An exploratory study was developed with a mixed methodology and a sample collected from the Web of Science of articles published in 2018. The results show the current prevalence of Computer Science in studies related to ontology and also of Gruber's view suggesting ontology as kind of conceptualization, a dominant view in that field. Some researchers, particularly in the field of Biomedicine, do not adhere to this dominant view, but to another one that seems closer to ontological study in the philosophical context. The term ontology, in the context of information systems, appears to be consolidating with a different meaning from the original presenting traces of the process of metaphorization in the transfer of the term between the two fields of study.","authors":["Luis Machado","Mauricio Barcellos Almeida","Renato Rocha Souza"],"meta":["January 2020Knowledge Organization","DOI:10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-199","Project: PhD project"],"references":["328581661_Ontologia_para_representacao_de_tempo_no_contexto_de_indicadores_de_desempenho","328564305_Materializacao_da_Web_Semantica_um_modelo_de_construcao_dinamica_de_consultas_baseados_em_mapeamento_de_ontologias","328166165_Structured_peer-to-peer-based_publication_and_sharing_of_ontologies_to_automatically_process_SPARQL_query_on_a_semantic_sensor_network","328145335_From_Affective_Science_to_Psychiatric_Disorder_Ontology_as_a_Semantic_Bridge","328115840_A_computational_tool_for_creative_idea_generation_based_on_analogical_reasoning_and_ontology","327567467_Linked_open_data-based_framework_for_automatic_biomedical_ontology_generation","346747474_Using_Association_Rules_to_Enrich_Arabic_Ontology","344071466_Critical_Scientific_Realism","327990060_An_ontology-oriented_knowledge_methodology_for_process_planning_in_additive_layer_manufacturing","327529437_Ontology_optimization_algorithm_for_similarity_measuring_and_ontology_mapping_using_adjoint_graph_framework"]}
