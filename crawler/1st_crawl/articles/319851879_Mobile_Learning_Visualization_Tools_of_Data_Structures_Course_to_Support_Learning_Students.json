{"id":"319851879_Mobile_Learning_Visualization_Tools_of_Data_Structures_Course_to_Support_Learning_Students","abstract":"Mobile learning course of data structure, it cannot only be used as auxiliaries of learning, but also an independent learning mode. The various approaches theory of research and development, software design, and methods we use into built of media. The main objective is the construction of educational software adapted to learning. First and foremost, it is essential to have in mind that our application is designed for two very specific public; on the one side the lectures, who will use it as a teaching tool, and another side the students, for learning purposes. This research has created a mobile learning application for courses of data structures, the learning material is presented visually according curriculum-syllabus and learning outcomes of data structures. This application as one a learning media to support students who can be used all the time (long life learning). \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2991/seadric-17.2017.88","authors":["Edy Budiman","Ummul Hairah"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.2991/seadric-17.2017.88","Conference: 5th South East Asia Development Research (SEA-DR) 2017 International ConferenceAt: Lambung Mangkurat UniversityVolume: 100"],"references":["318085085_End-to-End_QoS_Tool_Development_and_Performance_Analysis_for_Network_Mobile","313806861_Measuring_quality_of_service_for_mobile_internet_services","280645657_A_Review_of_Mobile_Learning_Applications_for_Mathematics","277582466_The_Effect_of_Peer_Review_on_Student_Learning_Outcomes_in_a_Research_Methods_Course","267337349_A_Review_of_Research_on_Mobile_Learning_in_Teacher_Education","313368988_Data_Structures_Learning_-_A_Visually_Assisted_Approach","312940406_Computer_Science_Curricula_2013_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Computer_Science","312791911_Information_System_Development_Life_Cycle_Models","283677110_Mobile_applications'_impact_on_student_performance_and_satisfaction","265937876_STUDY_COMPARISON_OF_SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_LIFE_CYCLE_MODELS"]}
