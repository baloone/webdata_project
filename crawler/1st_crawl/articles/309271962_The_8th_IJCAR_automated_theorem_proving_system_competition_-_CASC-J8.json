CASC-J8 was the twenty-first competition in the CASC series. Twenty-one ATP systems and system variants competed in the various competition divisions. An outline of the competition design, and a commentated summary of the results, are presented.","authors":["Geoff Sutcliffe"],"meta":["October 2016Ai Communications 29(5):1-13","DOI:10.3233/AIC-160709"],"references":["304919080_Agent-Based_HOL_Reasoning","303912895_Effective_Normalization_Techniques_for_HOL","277679423_CakeML","275974009_LeoPARD_---_A_Generic_Platform_for_the_Implementation_of_Higher-Order_Reasoners","257527002_Loops_with_Abelian_Inner_Mapping_Groups_An_Application_of_Automated_Deduction","221302561_A_Brief_Overview_of_HOL4","23962660_A_Revision_of_the_Proof_of_the_Kepler_Conjecture","319394475_The_CADE-16_ATP_system_competition","305520991_The_CADE_ATP_System_Competition_-_CASC","303901317_Predicate_Elimination_for_Preprocessing_in_First-Order_Theorem_Proving","303901085_Finding_Finite_Models_in_Multi-sorted_First-Order_Logic","303765719_The_CADE-25_automated_theorem_proving_system_competition-CASC-25","281768653_Premise_Selection_and_External_Provers_for_HOL4","266984900_StarExec_A_Cross-Community_Infrastructure_for_Logic_Solving","265438718_The_TPTP_problem_library_and_associated_infrastructure_ttthe_FOF_and_CNF_Parts_v350","262359193_First-Order_Theorem_Proving_and_Vampire","222648893_Evaluating_general_purpose_automated_theorem_proving_systems","221302534_HOL_Light_An_Overview","220806268_Sine_Qua_Non_for_Large_Theory_Reasoning","220532485_Using_Hints_to_Increase_the_Effectiveness_of_an_Automated_Reasoning_Program_Case_Studies"]}
