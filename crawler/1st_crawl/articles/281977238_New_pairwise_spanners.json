{"id":"281977238_New_pairwise_spanners","abstract":"Let G = (V,E) be an undirected unweighted graph on n vertices. A subgraph H of G is called an (all-pairs) purely additive spanner with stretch β if for every (u, v) ∈ V × V, distH (u, v) ≤ distG (u, v) + β. The problem of computing sparse spanners with small stretch β is well-studied. Here we consider the following relaxation: we are given P ⊆ V ×V and we seek a sparse subgraph H where distH (u, v) ≤ distG (u, v) + β for each (u, v) ∈ P. Such a subgraph is called a pairwise spanner with additive stretch β and our goal is to construct such subgraphs that are sparser than all-pairs spanners with the same stretch. We show sparse pairwise spanners with additive stretch 4 and with additive stretch 6. We also consider the following special cases: P = S × V and P = S × T, where S ⊆ V and T ⊆ V, and show sparser pairwise spanners for these cases.","authors":["T.
