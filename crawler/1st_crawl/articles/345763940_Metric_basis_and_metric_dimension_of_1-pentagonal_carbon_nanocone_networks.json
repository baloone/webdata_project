It has a lot of applications in computer, chemistry, pharmacy and mathematical disciplines. A subset S of the vertex set V of a connected graph G resolves G if all vertices of G have different representations with respect to S. A metric basis for G is a resolving set having minimum cardinal number and this cardinal number is called the metric dimension of G. In present work, we find a metric basis and also metric dimension of 1-pentagonal carbon nanocones. We conclude that only three vertices are minimal requirement for the unique identification of all vertices in this network.","authors":["Zafar Hussain","Mobeen Munir","Ashfaq Ahmad","Maqbool Chaudhary"],"meta":["November 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-76516-1","Project: Dimensions of some graphs"],"references":["327511533_On_Molecular_Descriptors_of_Carbon_Nanocones","326609997_Computing_Metric_Dimension_and_Metric_Basis_of_2D_Lattice_of_Alpha-Boron_Nanotubes","325657530_Computing_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Gear_Graphs","289434514_The_eccentric_connectivity_index_of_one_pentagonal_carbon_nanocones","286859424_On_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Petersen_Graphs_Pn_3","338861245_Computational_aspects_of_line_graph_of_carbon_nanocones","324251387_Topological_modeling_of_1-Pentagon_carbon_nanocones_-_topological_efficiency_and_magic_sizes","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","294109746_The_Adjacent_Eccentric_Distance_Sum_Index_of_One_Pentagonal_Carbon_Nanocones","284044984_Helical_Microtubules_of_Graphitic_Carbon"]}
