These types of problems have not been intensively investigated in the literature so far. For several problems of these types with standard objective functions (namely the minimization of makespan, total tardiness, number of tardy jobs, total completion time and maximum lateness), we present some complexity results. Particular attention is given to the problem of minimizing total tardiness. In addition, for the so-called budget scheduling problem with minimizing the makespan, we present some properties of feasible schedules.","authors":["Evgeny Gafarov","Alexander Lazarev","Frank Werner"],"meta":["July 2011Mathematical Social Sciences 62(1):7-13","DOI:10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2011.04.004","SourceDBLP"],"references":["250949929_Special_case_of_the_single_machine_total_tardiness_problem_is_NP-hard","324336322_Job_Shop_Scheduling_under_a_Non-Renewable_Resource_Constraint","245280646_Job_Shop_Scheduling_under_a_NonRenewable_Resource_Constraint","245280420_Scheduling_under_a_Nonrenewable_Resource_Constraint","244435426_Minimizing_Total_Tardiness_on_One_Processor_is_NP-Hard","243786630_Minimizing_Total_Tardiness_on_One_Machine_is_NP-Hard","242923558_Solution_of_the_single_machine_total_tardiness_problem","242814089_Scheduling_subject_to_nonrenewable-resource_constraints","242506265_Complexity_of_Machine_Scheduling_Problems","232385101_A_Pseudopolynomial_Algorithm_for_Sequencing_Jobs_to_Minimize_Total_Tardiness","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","225793321_One-machine_scheduling_problems_with_resource_constraints","223701498_A_Decomposition_Algorithm_for_the_Single_Machine_Total_Tardiness_Problem","222933716_Algorithms_for_special_cases_of_the_single_machine_total_tardiness_problem_and_an_application_to_the_even-odd_partition_problem","222164304_Slowinski_R_Preemptive_scheduling_of_independent_jobs_on_parallel_machines_subject_to_financial_constraints_European_Journal_of_Operational_Research_15_366-373","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
