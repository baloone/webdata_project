{"id":"273257218_Geometry-preserving_Encryption_for_3D_Meshes","abstract":"This paper introduces a geometry-preserving protection paradigm that heavily distorts 3D objects while preserving some intrinsic geometrical property (e.g. the bounding box or the convex hull), thereby avoiding a global corruption of the whole 3D scene. Backward compatibility is guaranteed de facto : legacy non-compliant rendering engines can display 3D scenes containing protected objects, but only compliant renderers with the necessary credentials can display deprotected objects. We propose a couple of permutation-based encryption algorithms embracing this geometry-preserving strategy and then detail some challenges related to them. For instance, we discuss the side-effects of such protection mechanisms on other baseline 3D primitives, e.g. the rendering time, as well as the difficulty of assessing the security of such algorithms.","authors":["Marc Éluard","Yves Maetz","Gwenaël Doërr"],"meta":["November 2013","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.1.3925.6165","Conference: COmpression et REprésentation des Signaux Audiovisuels (CORESA)"],"references":["228373400_3D_Rasterization-Unifying_Rasterization_and_Ray_Casting","224182471_Tracing_Pirated_Content_on_the_Internet_Unwinding_Ariadne's_Thread","224074931_Connectivity_shapes","222656093_Technologies_for_3D_mesh_compression_A_survey","221123350_Measuring_the_strength_of_partial_encryption_scheme","220954536_Graph-Based_Surface_Reconstruction_Using_Structures_in_Scattered_Point_Sets","267108978_Introduction_to_Computer_Graphics","240424634_XML_Encryption_Syntax_and_Processing_W3C_Recommendation","221274813_Format-Preserving_Encryption","221208228_Ciphers_with_Arbitrary_Finite_Domains","3308712_A_Progressive_View-Dependent_Technique_for_Interactive_3-D_Mesh_Transmission","220721235_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Unorganized_Points","220494158_Fast_3D_Line_Segment-Triangle_Intersection_Test","220334218_Ciphers_with_Arbitrary_Finite_Domains","220307638_From_3D_Mesh_Data_Hiding_to_3D_Shape_Blind_and_Robust_Watermarking_A_Survey"]}
