{"id":"290035534_Investigating_performances's_progress_of_students","abstract":"This paper investigates how performance of students progresses during their studies. Progression of a student is defined as a tuple that shows how a year average stays the same, increases or decreases compared to first year. Taking the data of two consecutive cohorts and using k-means clustering, five meaningful types of progressions are put in evidence and intuitively visualized with a deviation diagram. Interestingly, in both cohorts students globally progress or remain stable. Still, the two cohorts exhibit differences. A future work is to refine the present aggregative approach and to investigate dependencies between prediction and progression.","authors":["Raheela Asif","Agathe Merceron","M.K.
