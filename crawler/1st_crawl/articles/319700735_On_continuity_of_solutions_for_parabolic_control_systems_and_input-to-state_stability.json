{"id":"319700735_On_continuity_of_solutions_for_parabolic_control_systems_and_input-to-state_stability","abstract":"This article deals with characterizations of $L^\\infty$-admissible operators for linear control systems. We present a result linking a version of the Weiss conjecture for $L^{\\infty}$ to the boundedness of the $H^\\infty$-calculus for analytic semigroup generators $A$. Moreover, we obtain admissibility with respect to Orlicz spaces, which has consequences for the study of input-to-state stability. In particular, we show that on Hilbert spaces the notions of input-to-state stability and integral-input-to-state stability coincide if the analytic semigroup is similar to contraction semigroup and the input space is finite-dimensional.","authors":["Birgit Jacob","Felix Schwenninger","Hans Zwart"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Differential Equations 266(10)","DOI:10.1016/j.jde.2018.11.004"],"references":["319272148_Strong_input-to-state_stability_for_infinite_dimensional_linear_systems","313157552_Characterizations_of_Input-to-State_Stability_for_Infinite-Dimensional_Systems","308807253_Infinite-Dimensional_Input-to-State_Stability_and_Orlicz_Spaces","263012367_Characterizations_of_integral_input-to-state_stability_for_bilinear_systems_in_infinite_dimensions","312914550_Operators_of_type_o_without_a_bounded_H_functional_calculus","301897781_ISS_In_Different_Norms_For_1-D_Parabolic_Pdes_With_Boundary_Disturbances","277334802_ISS_with_Respect_to_Boundary_Disturbances_for_1-D_Parabolic_PDEs","265715283_a-admissibility_of_observation_and_control_operators","258247340_Square_Function_Estimates_and_Functional_Calculi","257882691_On_the_structure_of_semigroups_on_Lp_with_a_bounded_H_-calculus"]}
