{"id":"341534456_A_infocomunicacao_ou_a_convergencia_das_Ciencias_da_Informacao_e_da_Comunicacao_para_um_objeto_comum","abstract":"Resulting from the closing conference of the VI Post-Graduate Workshop in Information Science, in 2019, the text presents a position in defense of the existence of the operational concept of infocommunication. Information has been an aggregating element and a central object of both Information Science and Communication Sciences, as well as Information Technology and Computer Science. Despite this reality, its treatment and perspective diverge countless times and on many\noccasions it generates conflicts. The development and greater maturity of these areas and fields of knowledge have sought to respond to the growing need of understanding phenomena associated with information, communication and the digital. In this context, human activity is generated, with a new generation of information, whose increasing complexity and impact on multiple areas of human activity requires new forms of understanding.","authors":["Luis Borges Gouveia","Armando Malheiro da Silva"],"meta":["May 2020","DOI:10.21747/21836671/pag2020a2"],"references":[]}
