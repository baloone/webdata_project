{"id":"346603084_ShExML_Improving_the_usability_of_heterogeneous_data_mapping_languages_for_first-time_users","abstract":"Integration of heterogeneous data sources in a single representation is an active field with many different tools and techniques. In the case of text-based approaches—those that base the definition of the mappings and the integration on a DSL—there is a lack of usability studies. In this work we have conducted a usability experiment (n = 17) on three different languages: ShExML (our own language), YARRRML and SPARQL-Generate. Results show that ShExML users tend to perform better than those of YARRRML and SPARQL-Generate. This study sheds light on usability aspects of these languages design and remarks some aspects of improvement.","authors":["Herminio García-González","Iovka Boneva","Sławek Staworko","Jose Emilio Labra Gayo"],"meta":["November 2020PeerJ Computer Science 6(e318)","DOI:10.7717/peerj-cs.318"],"references":["319393667_Gloze_XML_to_RDF_and_back_again","316973352_Enhancing_JSON_to_RDF_Data_Conversion_with_Entity_Type_Recognition","303098520_RMLEditor_A_Graph-based_Mapping_Editor_for_Linked_Data_Mappings","300897674_Sheet2RDF_a_Flexible_and_Dynamic_Spreadsheet_ImportLifting_Framework_for_RDF","329126323_ShExML_An_heterogeneous_data_mapping_language_based_on_ShEx","320899446_RML_and_FnO_Shaping_DBpedia_Declaratively","320204037_Semantics_and_Validation_of_Shapes_Schemas_for_RDF","317806290_Flexible_RDF_Generation_from_RDF_and_Heterogeneous_Data_Sources_with_SPARQL-Generate","317177239_A_SPARQL_Extension_for_Generating_RDF_from_Heterogeneous_Formats","312241091_Rdf_serialization_from_JSON_data_The_case_of_JSON_data_in_Diavgeiagovgr"]}
