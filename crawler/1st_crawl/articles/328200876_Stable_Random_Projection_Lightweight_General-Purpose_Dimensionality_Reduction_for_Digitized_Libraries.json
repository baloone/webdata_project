{"id":"328200876_Stable_Random_Projection_Lightweight_General-Purpose_Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Digitized_Libraries","abstract":"Digital libraries today distribute their contents in a way that limits the sort of work that can be done with them. Modern libraries are so large-often containing millions of books or articles-that the technical resources needed to work with them can be immense. Beginning researchers and students often cannot practically obtain more than a few thousand books at a time. Advanced researchers must use (often incomplete) metadata to decide which books are of interest for their projects; and libraries themselves lack ways for make their full-text holdings easily discoverable by researchers or integrated with other collections.","authors":["Benjamin Schmidt"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.31235/osf.io/36neu"],"references":[]}
