{"id":"334692035_Bagging_Approach_for_Italian_Domination_in_CnPm","abstract":"For graph G = (V,E), the open neighborhood of a vertex v is N(v) = {u ∈ V|uv ∈ E}. A function f:V(G) → {0,1,2} is called an Italian dominating function of G if ∑u∈N(v)f(u)≥2, for each vertex f(v) = 0. The weight of f is w(f) = ∑v∈V(G)f(v). The minimum weight of an Italian dominating function of G is called the Italian domination number of G, denoted by γI(G). In this paper, we present a bagging approach and a partitioning approach to investigate the Italian domination number of Cartesian product of circles and paths, Cn□Pm. We determine the exact values of the Italian domination numbers of Cn□P3, C3□Pm. We also present some bounds on the Italian domination number of Cn□Pm for n,m≥4.","authors":["Hong Gao","Tingting Xu","Yuansheng Yang"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931053"],"references":["331138988_Outer-Independent_Italian_Domination_in_Graphs","327911761_The_Double_Roman_Domatic_Number_of_a_Digraph","319959631_Some_notes_on_the_Roman_domination_number_and_Italian_domination_number_in_graphs","318601156_Weak_2-domination_number_of_Cartesian_products_of_cycles","327431063_Global_italian_domination_in_graphs","321284010_Independent_Roman_2_-domination_in_graphs","309382390_Italian_domination_in_trees","286756680_Roman_2-domination","220358877_An_efficient_parallel_strategy_for_the_perfect_domination_problem_on_distance-hereditary_graphs"]}
