{"id":"319115367_Qery_nesting_assignment_and_aggregation_in_SPARQL_11","abstract":"Answering aggregate queries is a key requirement of emerging applications of Semantic Technologies, such as data warehousing, business intelligence, and sensor networks. To fulfil the requirements of such applications, the standardization of SPARQL 1.1 led to the introduction of a wide range of constructs that enable value computation, aggregation, and query nesting. In this article, we provide an in-depth formal analysis of the semantics and expressive power of these new constructs as defined in the SPARQL 1.1 specification, and hence lay the necessary foundations for the development of robust, scalable, and extensible query engines supporting complex numerical and analytics tasks.","authors":["Mark Kaminski","Egor Kostylev","Bernardo Cuenca Grau"],"meta":["August 2017ACM Transactions on Database Systems 42(3):1-46","DOI:10.1145/3083898"],"references":["283872754_Processing_Linked_Open_Data_Cubes","280621142_Towards_Reconciling_SPARQL_and_Certain_Answers","278739694_On_the_power_of_SPARQL_in_expressing_navigational_queries","273394003_Using_Semantic_Web_Technologies_for_Exploratory_OLAP_A_Survey","267469813_C-SPARQL_A_continuous_query_language_for_rdf_data_streams","267452896_SAFE_Policy_Aware_SPARQL_Query_Federation_Over_RDF_Data_Cubes","261960730_RDF_Analytics_Lenses_over_Semantic_Graphs","257030012_Enabling_Query_Technologies_for_the_Semantic_Sensor_Web","235793114_Enhancing_OLAP_Analysis_with_Web_Cubes","228518672_Static_Analysis_and_Optimization_of_Semantic_Web_Queries","225070216_Linked_Data_The_Story_so_Far","221118216_Subqueries_in_SPARQL","220555884_Query_Languages_for_Bags_-_Expressive_Power_and_Complexity","220431863_Deciding_equivalences_among_conjunctive_aggregate_queries","220225154_Rewriting_queries_with_arbitrary_aggregation_functions_using_views","200034254_Logics_with_Aggregate_Operators","200034040_C_The_expressive_power_of_SPARQL","41004545_Foundations_of_SPARQL_query_optimization","2807540_Query_Languages_for_Bags","312634328_Semantics_and_Expressive_Power_of_Subqueries_and_Aggregates_in_SPARQL_11","306290518_Exploiting_linked_data_cubes_with_opencube_toolkit","302569922_On_expressibility_of_non-monotone_operators_in_SPARQL","301953180_On_the_Semantics_of_SPARQL_Queries_with_Optional_Matching_under_Entailment_Regimes","301866322_Foundations_of_SPARQL_Query_Optimization","300883940_Processing_Aggregate_Queries_in_a_Federation_of_SPARQL_Endpoints","300337064_SPARQL_with_Property_Paths","282463017_Efficient_processing_of_window_functions_in_analytical_SQL_queries","281471085_Efficient_OLAP_operations_for_RDF_analytics","271386137_Answering_SPARQL_queries_over_databases_under_OWL_2_QL_entailment_regime","266657756_Expressive_languages_for_querying_the_Semantic_Web","265374354_Equivalence_of_Relational_Algebra_and_Relational_Calculus_Query_Languages_Having_Aggregate_Functions","262297021_Containment_of_aggregate_queries","261565955_On_the_primitivity_of_operators_in_SPARQL","259279473_On_the_relation_between_SPARQL11_and_Answer_Set_Programming","257640493_Federating_queries_in_SPARQL_11_Syntax_semantics_and_evaluation","254008884_Counting_beyond_a_Yottabyte_or_how_SPARQL_11_property_paths_will_prevent_adoption_of_the_standard","242437684_Datacube_a_relational_aggregation_operator_generalizing_group-by","241623542_The_complexity_of_evaluating_path_expressions_in_SPARQL","230609685_Optimization_of_Analytic_Window_Functions","222921555_Expressive_power_of_SQL","222234465_Query_Languages_for_Bags_and_Aggregate_Functions","221559853_Querying_semantic_web_data_with_SPARQL","221214874_Graph_Cube_On_Warehousing_and_OLAP_Multidimensional_Networks","221024038_EP-SPARQL_A_unified_language_for_event_processing_and_stream_reasoning","220473781_Equivalence_of_queries_that_are_sensitive_to_multiplicities","220266323_Equivalence_of_queries_combining_set_and_bag-set_semantics","200034528_Towards_Tractable_Algebras_for_Bags","200034255_Logics_with_Counting_and_Local_Properties","2817466_Data_Cube_A_Relational_Aggregation_Operator_Generalizing_Group-By_Cross-Tab_and_Sub-Totals","2589333_New_Techniques_for_Studying_Set_Languages_Bag_Languages_and_Aggregate_Functions","1959441_Semantics_and_complexity_of_SPARQL","1956195_Arithmetic_First-Order_Logic_and_Counting_Quantifiers"]}
