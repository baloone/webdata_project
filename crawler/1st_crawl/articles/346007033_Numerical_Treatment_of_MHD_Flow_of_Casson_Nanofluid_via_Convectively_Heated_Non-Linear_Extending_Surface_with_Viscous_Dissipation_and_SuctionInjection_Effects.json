By utilizing the similarity transformations, the leading PDEs are transformed into a set of ODEs with adequate boundary conditions and then resolved numerically by (4-5) th-order Runge-Kutta Fehlberg procedure based on the shooting technique. Numerical computations are carried out by Maple 15 software. With the support of graphs, the impact of dimensionless control parameters on the nanoparticle concentration profiles, the temperature, and the flow velocity are studied. Other parameters of interest, such as the skin friction coefficient , heat, and mass transport at the diverse situation and dependency of various parameters are inspected through tables and graphs. Additionally, it is verified that the numerical computations with the reported earlier studies are in an excellent approval. It is found that the heat and mass transmit rates are enhanced with the increasing values of the power-index and the suction (blowing) parameter, whilst are reduced with the boosting Casson and the heat absorption (generation) parameters. Also, the drag force coefficient is an increasing function of the power-index and a reduction function of Casson parameter.","authors":["Hammad Alotaibi","Saeed Althubiti","Mohamed R Eid","Kasseb L.
