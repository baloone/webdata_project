{"id":"256760582_On_partial_shadowing_of_complete_pseudo-orbits","abstract":"In recent years many new definitions of shadowing, using a notion of ergodic (or average) pseudo-orbit were introduced. While, under the assumption of chain mixing, average pseudo-orbit usually can be equivalently replaced by pseudo-orbit in these definitions of shadowing, it is not completely clear when these shadowing properties (i.e. approximation of a pseudo-orbit by a real orbit on a sufficiently large set of indices) can or cannot occur. In this paper we analyze necessary and sufficient conditions for shadowing over a set with positive density (or syndetic). While we do not provide full characterization, a few relations to standard notions from topological dynamics are obtained.","authors":["Piotr Oprocha","Dawoud Ahmadi Dastjerdi","Maryam Hosseini"],"meta":["August 2013Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 404(1):47â€“56","DOI:10.1016/j.jmaa.2013.02.068"],"references":["243963794_On_almost_specification_and_average_shadowing_properties","228376430_Local_entropy_theory","289384081_Decomposition_of_dynamical_systems_on_an_interval","268496728_Specification_on_the_interval","267175672_Devaney's_chaos_or_2-scattering_implies_Li-Yorke's_chaos","267042128_On_the_Ergodic_Shadowing","265327438_Recurrence_in_topological_dynamics_Furstenberg_families_and_Ellis_actions","257003646_A_note_on_the_average_shadowing_property_for_expansive_maps","251474104_The_average-shadowing_property_and_strong_ergodicity","251473591_Syndetically_proximal_pairs","246830585_Minimal_Flows_and_their_Extensions","246263952_Fully_positive_topological_entropy_and_topological_mixing","243751601_Recurrence_in_Ergodic_Theory_and_Combinatorial_Number_Theory","243028531_Families_filters_and_chaos","243026103_Sub-shadowings","233000558_Exploring_the_asymptotic_average_shadowing_property","231873998_Metric_properties_of_e-trajectories_of_dynamical_systems_with_stochastic_behaviour","228920002_Average_shadowing_properties_on_compact_metric_spaces","222549523_On_shadowing_Ordinary_and_ergodic","2126829_Independence_in_topological_and_C-dynamics","1734907_Chain_recurrence_rates_and_topological_entropy"]}
