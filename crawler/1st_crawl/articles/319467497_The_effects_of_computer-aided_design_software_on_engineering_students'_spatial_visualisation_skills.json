A quasi-experimental design was applied, using the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test-Visualization of Rotations (PSVT:R) for both the pre- and the post-test. The participants were 116 freshman students in the first year of their undergraduate programme in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at a university in Turkey. A total of 72 students comprised the experimental group; they were instructed with CAD-based activities in an engineering drawing course. The control group consisted of 44 students who did not attend this course. The results of the study showed that a CAD-based engineering drawing course had a positive effect on developing engineering students’ spatial visualisation skills. Additionally, the results of the study showed that spatial visualisation skills can be a predictor for success in a computer-aided engineering drawing course.","authors":["Temel Kösa","Fatih Karakuş"],"meta":["September 2017European Journal of Engineering Education 43(2):1-13","DOI:10.1080/03043797.2017.1370578"],"references":["279977804_Spatial_Ability_in_Computer-Aided_Design_Courses","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","289962996_Individual_differences_in_speed_and_level_in_spatial_abilityStandford_University","288470691_The_relationship_between_spatial_visualization_ability_and_problem_solving_in_structural_design","284115786_Computer-aided_design_manufacturing_and_management","275770875_Spatial_Visualization_Learning_in_Engineering_Traditional_Methods_vs_a_Web-Based_Tool","272574696_The_Importance_of_Spatial_Visualization_and_Cognitive_Development_for_Geometry_Learning_in_Preservice_Elementary_Teachers","271429461_Educational_Research_Planning_Planning_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Research","270960149_Research_Methods_In_Education","265086460_How_to_Design_and_Evaluate_Research_in_Education"]}
