{"id":"305577640_Data-Driven_Storytelling","abstract":"This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 16061 “Data-Driven Storytelling”. Close to forty researchers and practitioners descended on Schloss Dagstuhl to forge an interdisciplinary agenda on the topic of data-driven storytelling using visualization in early February, 2016. With burgeoning research interest in understanding what makes visualization effective for communication, and with practitioners pushing the envelope of the craft of visual communication, the meeting put different modes of thinking between computer science researchers and data visualization practitioners in close proximity for a week.","authors":["Sheelagh Carpendale","Nicholas Diakopoulos","Nathalie Henry Riche","Christophe Hurter"],"meta":["February 2016"],"references":[]}
