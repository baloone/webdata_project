Here, by comparison of the known methods have constructed the methods with the new properties which have applied to solve the initial-value problem for the ODE and for the Volterra integra-differential equations. By the construction of some relation between of these equations have established the direct connection among them which have called as the p -equivalents between the initial-value problem for ODE and for the Volterra integro-differential equations. Constructed here the stable methods with the high order of accuracy show some advantages of them. Some of them are applied to solving of the initial-value problem for the Volterra integro-differential equations. And also for the illustration of the received results here constructed have applied one of these methods to solve the model problem.","authors":["G Mehdiyeva","Vagif Rza Ibrahimov","Mehriban Imanova"],"meta":["October 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1334(1):012007","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1334/1/012007"],"references":["328790410_Some_Comparisons_of_the_Methods_Applied_to_Solving_the_First-Order_Integro-Differential_Equations","319596587_One_a_way_for_Constructing_Hybrid_Methods_with_the_Constant_Coefficients_and_their_Applied","307913323_Two-step_methods_and_bi-orthogonality","343544766_Methods_of_Adams_type_with_second_derivatives","326705866_On_a_one_method_for_determining_the_maximum_value_of_the_order_of_the_accuracy_for_the_multistep_hybrid_method_which_have_applied_to_solving_of_the_Volterra_integro-differential_equation_of_the_first_","320487958_A_Way_to_Construct_an_Algorithm_that_Uses_Hybrid_Methods","309319975_On_the_research_of_multi-step_methods_with_constant_coefficients","303488316_Marginal_Stability_and_Stabilization_in_the_Numerical_Integration_of_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","303334529_Runge-kutta_theory_for_volterra_and_abel_integral_equations_of_the_second_kind","301349978_Babatola_PO_Accurate_collocation_multistep_method_for_integration_of_first_order_ordinary_differential_equations"]}
