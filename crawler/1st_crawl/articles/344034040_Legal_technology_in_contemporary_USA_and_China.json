{"id":"344034040_Legal_technology_in_contemporary_USA_and_China","abstract":"The US and China are two typical models that present legal tech trends that are common world over. In China, robust regional models of intelligent judicial systems have emerged alongside some common applications that include the same-type case referencing, automated sentencing decision, uniform standards of evidence, and judgesâ€™ data profiling systems. In the US, legal tech refers to artificial intelligence in domains such as innovative legal research, predictive litigation analysis, e-discovery, and contract review.\nThe common elements in the development of legal tech in both countries are useful for other countries to understand. However, the legal tech in both countries has distinct characteristics, as seen in their different driving forces, target groups and purposes. The characteristics of legal tech are heavily related to each country's political background, legal system, and judicial structure. The different paths taken toward legal tech also remind us to reflect on the mistakes made and to explore some experiences pertaining to developing legal tech. For the strategic deployment, it is reasonable to apply cutting-edge technologies to the legal field until they are truly matured, and combine the top-level design with local pilot projects. For the target groups, litigants and vulnerable groups should not be neglected in legal tech service provision. For the purposes, machines should play an auxiliary role rather than replace judges altogether.","authors":["Ran Wang"],"meta":["November 2020Computer Law & Security Review 39:105459","DOI:10.1016/j.clsr.2020.105459"],"references":[]}
