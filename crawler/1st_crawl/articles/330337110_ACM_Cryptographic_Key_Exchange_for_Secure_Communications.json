{"id":"330337110_ACM_Cryptographic_Key_Exchange_for_Secure_Communications","abstract":"This paper presents a new cryptographic technique for secure authenticated key exchange. For information resource transactions cryptosystem [3] plays an important role in encrypting and decrypting the messages which are sent on secure communication channels for protecting from eavesdroppers. In this research study, the ACM key exchange (a new cryptographic key exchange technique) has been introduced for secure network communication. The ACM key exchange depends primarily on ACM (Annamalai Computing Model) for both key generation and key exchange. The ACM is actually a mathematical model which enables the ACM key exchange algorithm to create secret codes. A secret code carries the secure cryptographic key from one user to another user. The secret codes are generated using 'code for signs' such as Plus Sign Code (PSC) and Minus Sign Code (MSC), and Sum of Series of Powers of two (SSP). The PSC and MSC have been used as digital numbers in the research and these codes are juxtaposed with SSP for the purpose of key exchange securely.","authors":["C.
