{"id":"327565003_Risk_monitoring_through_better_knowledge-based_risk_processes","abstract":"Knowledge-based risk processes are becoming a key factor in the effective monitoring of risk. Therefore, knowledge-based risk processes and knowledge-based risk repositories are extensively used in information technology (IT) projects to successfully support risk monitoring. The aim of this paper is to propose a model that describes the integration of knowledge-based risks (via the processes of knowledge-based risk identification, analysis, evaluation and education) and knowledge-based risk repositories to support risk monitoring. This research paper utilizes the quantitative research method through questionnaires and the combined responses of 135 people employed in ten IT companies across Jordan. We applied smart partial least squares (PLS) software to analyze all our hypotheses. Our findings suggest that there is a constructive effect to acclimating knowledge-based risk identification, knowledge-based risk analysis and knowledge-based risk education when improving the risk monitoring mediation of a given knowledge-based risk repository.","authors":["Amine Nehari Talet","Louay Karadsheh","Mufleh Jarrah","Samer Alhawari"],"meta":["September 2018Journal of Operational Risk 13(3)","DOI:10.21314/JOP.2018.210"],"references":["349771502_The_effect_of_marketing_knowledge_management_on_organizational_performance_An_empirical_investigation_of_the_telecommunications_organizations_in_Jordan","308738317_Customer_Knowledge_Management_and_Organization's_Effectiveness_Explaining_the_Mediator_Role_of_Organizational_Agility","308737120_A_Model_for_Measuring_the_Direct_and_Indirect_Impact_of_Business_Intelligence_on_Organizational_Agility_with_Partial_Mediatory_role_of_Empowerment_Case_Study_Tehran_Construction_Engineering_Organizati","272375701_Knowledge_Management_Model_and_Instrument_for_Implementation_and_Adoption_Perspective_of_Developing_Country","271603359_Choosing_project_risk_management_techniques_A_theoretical_framework","309529355_Relationship_among_Project_Management_Processes_and_Knowledge_Repository_for_Project_Success","288961296_The_state_of_knowledge_management","285760446_Evaluating_structural_equation_models_with_unobservable_and_measuremenr_error","276899186_A_Global_Software_Engineering_Knowledge_Management_Approach_for_Intensive_Risk_Mitigation","260481377_Critical_success_factors_for_enterprise_risk_management_in_Chinese_construction_companies"]}
