{"id":"227166904_Towards_an_XML-Based_Standard_for_Timetabling_Problems_TTML","abstract":"A variety of approaches have been developed by researchers to solve different instances of timetabling problems. In these\nstudies different data formats are used to represent a timetabling problem instance and its solution, causing difficulties\nin the evaluation and comparison of approaches and sharing of data. In this paper, a model for timetabling problems and a\nnew XML data format for them based on MathML is proposed.","authors":["Ender Ã–zcan"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.1007/0-387-27744-7_8","In book: Multidisciplinary Scheduling: Theory and Applications (pp.163-185)"],"references":["220616976_On_the_Complexity_of_Timetable_and_Multicommodity_Flow_Problems","313502493_A_genetic_algorithm_solving_a_weekly_course-timetabling_problem","246387669_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Timetabling_and_Scheduling","242401887_A_Graph_Coloring_Algorithm_for_Large_Scheduling_Problems","226542192_A_memetic_algorithm_for_university_exam_timetabling","222293486_Finding_a_feasible_course_schedule_using_Tabu_search","221559150_A_Standard_Data_Format_for_Timetabling_Instances","221559111_A_Genetic_Algorithm_Solving_a_Weekly_Course-Timetabling_Problem","220460079_Timetable_Construction_-_An_Annotated_Bibliography","220350510_Timetabling_through_a_Deductive_Database_A_Case_Study"]}
