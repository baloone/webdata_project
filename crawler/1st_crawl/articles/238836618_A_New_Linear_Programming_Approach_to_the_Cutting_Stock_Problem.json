{"id":"238836618_A_New_Linear_Programming_Approach_to_the_Cutting_Stock_Problem","abstract":"A new approach to the one-dimensional cutting stock problem is described and compared to the classical model for which Gilmore and Gomory have developed a special column-generation technique. The new model is characterized by a dynamic use of simply structured cutting patterns. Nevertheless, it enables the representation of complex combinations of cuts. It can be advantageous in practical applications where many different stock lengths or a relatively large number of order lengths have to be dealt with. The new approach is applied to a real problem where the ″trim loss″ is not valueless, since it can be used for further demands arising in later planning periods.","authors":["Harald Dyckhoff"],"meta":["December 1981Operations Research 29(6):1092-1104","DOI:10.1287/opre.29.6.1092"],"references":["266478800_A_Linear_Programming_Approach_to_the_Cutting_Stock_Problem_I","265461353_A_Linear_Programming_Approach_to_the_Cutting_Stock_Problem-Part_II","242931633_An_Algorithm_for_Two-Dimensional_Cutting_Problems","242416423_Multi-Stage_Cutting_Stock_Problems_of_Two_or_More_Dimensions","227445423_The_Trim_Problem","227444499_An_Improved_Heuristic_Procedure_for_a_Nonlinear_Cutting_Stock_Problem","227443619_A_Heuristic_Programming_Solution_to_a_Nonlinear_Cutting_Stock_Problem","227345208_Mathematical_Methods_of_Organizing_and_Planning_Production","222775303_The_trim-loss_and_assortment_problems_A_survey"]}
