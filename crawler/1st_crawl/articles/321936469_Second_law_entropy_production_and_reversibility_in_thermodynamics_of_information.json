{"id":"321936469_Second_law_entropy_production_and_reversibility_in_thermodynamics_of_information","abstract":"We present a pedagogical review of the fundamental concepts in thermodynamics of information, by focusing on the second law of thermodynamics and the entropy production. Especially, we discuss the relationship among thermodynamic reversibility, logical reversibility, and heat emission in the context of the Landauer principle and clarify that these three concepts are fundamentally distinct to each other. We also discuss thermodynamics of measurement and feedback control by Maxwell's demon. We clarify that the demon and the second law are indeed consistent in the measurement and the feedback processes individually, by including the mutual information to the entropy production.","authors":["Takahiro Sagawa"],"meta":["December 2017"],"references":["272396224_Thermodynamics_of_information","266620860_An_improved_Landauer_principle_with_finite-size_corrections","265617090_The_Nature_of_Computation","232969702_The_Fluctuation_Theorem","26285210_Memory_Erasure_in_Small_Systems","284964010_Dissipative_Structures","275182135_Stochastic_Processes_in_Physics_and_Chemistry","255710930_PHYSICAL_REVIEW_A_VOLUME_8_NUMBER_4_OCTOBER_1973_Theory_of_Nonlinear_Transport_Processes_Nonlinear_Shear_Viscosity_anti_Normal_Stress_Effects","248076982_Thermodynamics_and_An_Introduction_to_Thermostatistics","243660881_Entanglement_and_the_foundations_of_statistical_mechanics","240134203_Network_theory_of_microscopic_and_Macroscopic_behavior_of_Master_equation_systems","234427631_The_physics_and_mathematics_of_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_Physics_Reports_310_1999_1-96","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","226112338_The_thermodynamics_of_computation---a_review","224536307_Maxwell's_Demon_Cannot_Operate_Information_and_Entropy_I","224043701_Handbook_of_Stochastic_Methods","223280439_A_general_framework_for_non-equilibrium_phenomena_The_master_equation_and_its_formal_consequences","222529272_Information-theoretic_approach_to_the_study_of_control_systems","26721192_Comment_on_Minimal_Energy_Cost_for_Thermodynamic_Information_Processing_Measurement_and_Information_Erasure_Reply","13388234_Use_of_mutual_information_to_decrease_entropy_Implications_for_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics"]}
