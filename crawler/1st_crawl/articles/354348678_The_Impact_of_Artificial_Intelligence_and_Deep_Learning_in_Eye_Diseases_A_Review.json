{"id":"354348678_The_Impact_of_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Deep_Learning_in_Eye_Diseases_A_Review","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subset of computer science dealing with the development and training of algorithms that try to replicate human intelligence. We report a clinical overview of the basic principles of AI that are fundamental to appreciating its application to ophthalmology practice. Here, we review the most common eye diseases, focusing on some of the potential challenges and limitations emerging with the development and application of this new technology into ophthalmology.","authors":["Raffaele Nuzzi","Giacomo Boscia","Paola Marolo","Federico Ricardi"],"meta":["August 2021Frontiers in Medicine 8","DOI:10.3389/fmed.2021.710329"],"references":["349632060_Applications_of_digital_health_for_public_health_responses_to_COVID-19_a_systematic_scoping_review_of_artificial_intelligence_telehealth_and_related_technologies","348777017_Digital_health_during_COVID-19_lessons_from_operationalising_new_models_of_care_in_ophthalmology","347950592_Referral_for_disease-related_visual_impairment_using_retinal_photograph-based_deep_learning_a_proof-of-concept_model_development_study","339981382_The_Hub-and-Spoke_Management_of_Glaucoma","339424559_Automated_identification_of_malignancy_in_whole-slide_pathological_images_identification_of_eyelid_malignant_melanoma_in_gigapixel_pathological_slides_using_deep_learning","338643411_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_for_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","338460985_Deep_learning_for_detecting_retinal_detachment_and_discerning_macular_status_using_ultra-widefield_fundus_images","344028237_Controversies_in_artificial_intelligence","341842948_Artificial_intelligence_in_cornea_refractive_and_cataract_surgery","339864457_Virtually_Perfect_Telemedicine_for_Covid-19"]}
