{"id":"351122174_Prime_Numbers_Calculation_Formulas","abstract":"The application of prime numbers in modern science, especially in computer science, is very wide. Since prime numbers can only divisible by 1 and themselves, they are not factored any further like whole numbers. The problem to calculate all prime numbers using a formula posed for long periods. Though different formulas to calculate prime numbers were developed by Euler, Fermat, Mersenne and others, the formulas work for limited natural numbers and calculate limited prime numbers. However, in this paper the author wants to show how prime numbers calculated for all values of integers using the following theorem.","authors":["Ameha Tefera"],"meta":["April 2021Applied Mathematics 11(1792-9687(print), 1792- 9709(online)):1792-9709","DOI:10.47260/tma/1111"],"references":["225408169_Prime_number_generation_using_memetic_programming","324634416_A_Hundred_Years_of_Prime_Numbers","275982160_Mathematics_in_the_Modern_World","274229376_Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory","265375634_Prime-Producing_Quadratics","242680143_A_SIMPLE_PRIME-GENERATING_RECURRENCE","220694260_An_Introduction_to_Theory_of_Numbers"]}
