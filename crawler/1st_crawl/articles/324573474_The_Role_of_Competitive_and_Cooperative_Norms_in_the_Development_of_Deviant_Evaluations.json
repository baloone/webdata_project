{"id":"324573474_The_Role_of_Competitive_and_Cooperative_Norms_in_the_Development_of_Deviant_Evaluations","abstract":"The present study examined how peer group norms influence children’s developing evaluations of deviant ingroup members. Following the manipulation of competitive or cooperative norms, participants (children, Mage = 8.69; adolescents, Mage = 13.81; adults, Mage = 20.89; n = 263) evaluated deviant ingroup members from their own and the group’s perspective. Children rated cooperative deviancy positively and believed their group would do the same. Adolescents and adults, by comparison, believed that their group would negatively evaluate cooperative deviancy. Reasoning varied based on the ingroup norm and participants’ personal agreement with deviancy. Understanding that an ingroup may not be favorable towards a deviant behaving cooperatively in a competitive context is a developmental challenge requiring the coordination of social and moral norms.","authors":["Luke McGuire","Michael T Rizzo","Melanie Killen","Adam Rutland"],"meta":["April 2018Child Development 90(6)","DOI:10.1111/cdev.13094","Project: The development of fair resource allocation: The role of social norms and group processes"],"references":["304782996_Children's_recognition_of_fairness_and_others'_welfare_in_a_resource_allocation_task_Age_related_changes","304070982_Children's_understanding_of_equity_in_the_context_of_inequality","282129329_Challenging_Gender_Stereotypes_Theory_of_Mind_and_Peer_Group_Dynamics","275101702_When_Does_the_In-Group_Like_the_Out-Group_Bias_Among_Children_as_a_Function_of_Group_Norms","273639080_Children's_prosocial_behavioural_intentions_towards_outgroup_members","270904865_The_effects_of_intergroup_competition_on_prosocial_behaviors_in_young_children_A_comparison_of_25-35_year-olds_with_55-65_year-olds","262340992_How_Groups_React_to_Disloyalty_in_the_Context_of_Intergroup_Competition_Evaluations_of_Group_Deserters_and_Defectors","260089737_Context_Differences_in_Children's_Ingroup_Preferences","257492180_Fairness_versus_Favoritism_in_Children","247720636_Vladimir's_Choice_and_the_Distribution_of_Social_ResourcesA_Group_Dominance_Perspective","247505898_The_'Black_Sheep_Effect'_Social_Categorization_Rejection_of_Ingroup_Deviates_and_Perception_of_Group_Variability","236930606_Rise_and_fall_of_competitiveness_in_individualistic_and_collectivistic_societies","227806163_The_Black_Sheep_Effect_Extremity_of_Judgments_towards_Ingroup_Members_as_a_Function_of_Group_Identification","226768886_A_New_Social-Cognitive_Developmental_Perspective_on_Prejudice_The_Interplay_Between_Morality_and_Group_Identity","221760147_Do_Infants_Have_a_Sense_of_Fairness","51612624_The_Developmental_Roots_of_Fairness_Infants'_Reactions_to_Equal_and_Unequal_Distributions_of_Resources","24102966_Fairness_and_The_Assumptions_of_Economics","23222622_Egalitarianism_in_Young_Children","319972050_Group_Norms_Intergroup_Resource_Allocation_and_Social_Reasoning_Among_Children_and_Adolescents","317725824_Young_children's_inclusion_decisions_in_moral_and_social-conventional_group_norm_contexts","310431099_Fair_Resource_Allocation_Among_Children_and_Adolescents_The_Role_of_Group_and_Developmental_Processes","305400476_Rectifying_social_inequalities_in_a_resource_allocation_task","304494007_The_Influence_of_Competition_on_Resource_Allocation_in_Preschool_Children_Competition_and_Resource_Allocation_in_Children","278793499_Peer_Group_Norms_and_Accountability_Moderate_the_Effect_of_School_Norms_on_Children's_Intergroup_Attitudes","263895179_When_Is_It_Okay_to_Exclude_a_Member_of_the_Ingroup_Children's_and_Adolescents'_Social_Reasoning","260605982_When_Do_Children_Dislike_Ingroup_Members_Resource_Allocation_from_Individual_and_Group_Perspectives","259703298_GPower_3_A_flexible_statistical_power_analysis_program_for_the_social_behavior_and_biomedical_sciences","247836521_The_Development_Of_Social_Knowledge_Morality_And_Convention","233722739_Development_of_Intra-_and_Intergroup_Judgments_in_the_Context_of_Moral_and_Social-Conventional_Norms","230006803_Capturing_the_Complexity_of_Moral_Development_and_Education","229744364_Correlates_of_motivation_for_competitive_or_cooperative_strategy_among_employed_adults","227747433_Effects_of_Group_Norms_on_Children's_Intentions_to_Bully","51717517_Children's_social_groups_and_intergroup_prejudice_Assessing_the_influence_and_inhibition_of_social_group_norms","51611691_Social_Groups_and_Children's_Intergroup_Attitudes_Can_School_Norms_Moderate_the_Effects_of_Social_Group_Norms","12053989_Children's_Social_Reasoning_about_Inclusion_and_Exclusion_in_Gender_and_Race_Peer_Group_Contexts"]}
