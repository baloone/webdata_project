{"id":"342956294_INTELLIGENT_PERSONALIZED_SYSTEM_FOR_ENHANCING_THE_QUALITY_OF_LEARNING","abstract":"This study proposes an approach for students' learning style personalization. The study presents both the importance and the theoretical basis of learning styles. One of these perspectives is how self-reported learning style inventories are controversial, while others view learning styles as strategies that can be adjusted to specific tasks and conditions. To determine the efficacy of the proposed approach, an experiment has been applied and a set of Canadian Institute College students have been examined. This study concludes that we need to offer alternative ways to connect various learning styles when teaching the university students which would enable the teaching process to use different learning approaches and activities which would lead eventually to enhancing the learning process.","authors":["Dalia Hassan","Ayman Elsayed Khedr","Amira M.
