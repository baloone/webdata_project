{"id":"313821021_Co-hydrotreatment_of_tire_pyrolysis_oil_and_vegetable_oil_for_the_production_of_transportation_fuels","abstract":"Catalytic hydrotreatment followed by products isomerization is an effective technology to convert vegetable oil to a green fuel composed of straight and branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. The content of aromatics in this fuel is very low. In this paper we study the co-hydrotreatment of vegetable oil and tires oil in the presence of a CoMo/Al2O3 catalyst as a way of utilizing existing infrastructure created for vegetable oil processing for tire oil up-grading in order to obtain fuel cuts with aromatics. Hydrotreatment studies with different vegetable oil/tires oil blend ratios were conducted. The yield and composition of the resulting hydrotreated oils are reported. Aliphatic hydrocarbons ranging from C7 to C20 derived from vegetable oils and aromatics from C6 to C16 derived from the tire oil were identified as products. The resulting oils were then successfully distilled into naphtha, kerosene, diesel and gas oil cuts. The yield, chemical composition and the fuel properties of the transportation fuel cuts obtained are reported and compared with commercial petro derived fuels.","authors":["Yinglei Han","Filip Stankovikj","Manuel Garcia-Perez"],"meta":["May 2017Fuel Processing Technology 159(8):328â€“339","DOI:10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.01.048","Project: Upgrading Biomass Pyrolysis Bio-oil to Renewable Fuels"],"references":["276593632_Hydrocracking_of_Waste_Cooking_Oil_as_Renewable_Fuel_on_NiWSiO2-Al2O3_Catalyst","268693368_Diesel_and_Aviation_Kerosene_with_desired_Aromatics_from_Hydroprocessing_of_Jatropha_oil_over_Hydrogenation_Catalysts_Supported_on_Hierarchical_Mesoporous_SAPO-11","305694297_Quantification_of_Bio-Oil_Functional_Groups_and_Evidences_of_the_Presence_of_Pyrolytic_Humins","272891100_Bio-aviation_fuel_production_from_hydroprocessing_castor_oil_promoted_by_the_nickel-based_bifunctional_catalysts","272627124_Comparative_Studies_of_the_CoMoMgO_CoMoAl2O3_and_CoMoMgO-MgAl2O4_Catalysts_Prepared_by_a_Urea-Matrix_Combustion_Method","272429513_Hydroisomerization_of_Long_Chain_n-Paraffins_over_PtZSM-22_Influence_of_SiAl_Ratio","272264913_Hydrotreatment_of_lignocellulosic_biomass_derived_oil_using_a_sulfided_NiMog-Al2O3_catalyst","270650722_Upgrading_model_compounds_and_Scrap_Tires_Pyrolysis_Oil_STPO_on_hydrotreating_NiMo_catalysts_with_tailored_supports","269924108_One-step_hydrodeoxygenation_of_palm_oil_to_isomerized_hydrocarbon_fuels_over_Ni_supported_on_nano-sized_SAPO-11_catalysts","263953712_Hydrocarbon_Fuels_Production_from_Hydrocracking_of_Soybean_Oil_Using_Transition_Metal_Carbides_and_Nitrides_Supported_on_ZSM-5","263947357_Conversion_of_Crude_Palm_Oil_into_Hydrocarbons_over_Commercial_Raney_Nickel","263283301_Effect_of_temperature_during_wood_torrefaction_on_the_formation_of_lignin_liquid_intermediates","263092985_The_role_of_cobalt_and_nickel_in_deoxygenation_of_vegetable_oils","260558180_Decarboxylation_and_further_transformation_of_oleic_acid_over_bifunctional_PtSAPO-11_catalyst_and_Ptchloride_Al2O3_catalysts","260394468_Production_of_bio-hydrogenated_diesel_by_catalytic_hydrotreating_of_palm_oil_over_NiMoS2g-Al2O3_catalyst","258438303_Catalytic_deoxygenation_of_triglycerides_and_fatty_acids_to_hydrocarbons_over_carbon-supported_nickel","257567085_Production_of_renewable_diesel_by_hydrotreatment_of_soybean_oil_Effect_of_reaction_parameters","257565596_Catalytic_deoxygenation_of_triglycerides_to_hydrocarbons_over_supported_nickel_catalysts","257210936_Diesel-like_hydrocarbon_production_from_hydroprocessing_of_relevant_refining_palm_oil","257176917_Deoxygenation_of_microalgal_oil_into_hydrocarbon_with_precious_metal_catalysts_Optimization_of_reaction_conditions_and_supports","256712625_A_commercially-viable_one-step_process_for_production_of_green_diesel_from_soybean_oil_on_PtSAPO-11","256712278_Support_effects_on_hydrotreating_of_soybean_oil_over_NiMo_carbide_catalyst","255249089_Analysis_of_Oxygenated_Compounds_in_Hydrotreated_Biomass_Fast_Pyrolysis_Oil_Distillate_Fractions","251724604_Catalyst_evaluation_for_waste_cooking_oil_hydroprocessing","251672681_Fuel_production_by_hydrotreating_of_triglycerides_on_NiMoAl_2O_3F_catalyst","248843456_Catalytic_hydrothermal_deoxygenation_of_palmitic_acid","244109171_Deoxygenation_of_vegetable_oils_over_sulfided_Ni_Mo_and_NiMo_catalysts","235216798_Isomerization_of_n-alkanes_derived_from_jatropha_oil_over_bifunctional_catalysts","232364749_Continuous_decarboxylation_of_lauric_acid_over_PdC_catalyst","232277500_Temperature-dependent_reaction_pathways_for_the_anomalous_hydrocracking_of_triglycerides_in_the_presence_of_sulfided_Co-Mo-catalyst","222855554_Production_of_diesel_fuel_from_renewable_feeds_Kinetics_of_ethyl_stearate_decarboxylation","222514930_Kinematic_viscosity_of_biodiesel_fuel_components_and_related_compounds_Influence_of_compound_structure_and_comparison_to_petrodiesel_fuel_components","215571832_Hydrotreating_and_Hydrocracking_Catalysts_for_Processing_of_Waste_soya-oil_and_Refinery-oil_mixtures","45286681_Fuel_purpose_hydrotreating_of_sunflower_oil_on_CoMoAl2O3_catalyst"]}
