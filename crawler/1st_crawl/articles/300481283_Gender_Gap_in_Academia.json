{"id":"300481283_Gender_Gap_in_Academia","abstract":"Despite increased attention from Universities and Industry, the low representation of female students in Computer Science undergraduate degrees remains a major issue. Recognising this issue, leading tech companies have established strong and committed diversity initiatives but have only reached up to 17\\% female representation in their tech departments. The causes of the reduced attraction and retention of female students are varied and have been widely studied, advancing the understanding of why female students do not take up or leave Computer Science. However, few analyses look at the perceptions of the females that have stayed in the field. In this paper, we explore the viewpoints of female academics and postgraduate students in Computer Science with various undergraduate backgrounds and pathways into academia. Our analysis of their interviews shows the influence of family, exposure, culture, sexism and gendered thought on their perceptions of the field, and of themselves and their peers. We identify that perceptions of identity conflict and a lack of belonging to the discipline persist even for these high-performing professionals.","authors":["Katrina Falkner","Claudia Szabo","Dee Michell","Anna Szorenyi"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1145/2729094.2742595","Conference: the 2015 ACM Conference"],"references":["269031977_Students_learn_CS_in_different_ways","268364998_Attrition_from_Australian_ICT_Degrees_-_Why_Women_Leave","268325574_By_RESEARCH_REPORT_The_Athena_Factor_Reversing_the_Brain_Drain_in_Science_Engineering_and_Technology","243596719_Why_so_Slow_The_Advancement_of_Women","228399609_Women_and_Men_Faculty_in_Academic_Science_and_Engineering_Social-Organizational_Indicators_and_Implications","220807988_Students_learn_CS_in_different_ways_Insights_from_an_empirical_study","220590682_The_Issue_of_Gender_Equity_in_Computer_Science_-_What_Students_Say","220536328_Explaining_the_IT_Gender_Gap_Australian_Stories_for_the_New_Millenium","47369848_Evidence_of_a_Collective_Intelligence_Factor_in_the_Performance_of_Human_Groups","40455335_Ambient_Belonging_How_Stereotypical_Cues_Impact_Gender_Participation_in_Computer_Science","30062961_An_Inconvenient_Truth_the_invisibility_of_Women_in_ICT","341438513_Why_So_Slow_The_Advancement_of_Women","311476050_Students_learn_CS_in_different_ways_insights_from_an_empirical_study","311473376_Unlocking_the_clubhouse_women_in_computing","285985136_The_Data_on_Diversity","260356814_Beyond_Bias_and_Barriers_Fulfilling_the_Potential_of_Women_in_Academic_Science_and_Engineering","246292425_Gender_Equity_and_Information_Technology_in_Education_The_Second_Decade","239540385_Talking_about_Leaving_Why_Undergraduates_Leave_the_Sciences","232455649_The_imposter_phenomenon_in_high_achieving_women_Dynamics_and_therapeutic_intervention","232431680_Motivation_to_succeed","221537226_Unlocking_The_Clubhouse_Women_in_Computing","220808275_Still_a_stranger_here_attitudes_among_secondary_school_students_towards_computer_science","220423419_Women_in_Computing-Take_2","49678058_Sex_Differences_in_Math-Intensive_Fields","19317543_Imposture_Inauthenticity_and_Feeling_Fraudulent","15298804_Sample_Size_in_Qualitative_Research"]}
