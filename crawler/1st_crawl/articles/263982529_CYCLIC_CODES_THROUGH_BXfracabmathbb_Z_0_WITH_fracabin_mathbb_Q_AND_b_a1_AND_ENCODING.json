In this paper we constructed cyclic codes, BCH codes, alternant codes, Goppa codes, Srivastava codes through monoid ring . For a = 1, almost all the results contained in [16] stands as a very particular case of this study.","authors":["Tariq  Shah","Antonio Andrade"],"meta":["January 2013Discrete Mathematics Algorithms and Applications 04(04)","DOI:10.1142/S1793830912500590"],"references":["262480615_Encoding_through_generalized_polynomial_codes","226556503_Generators_and_weights_of_polynomial_codes","242369129_Linear_Codes_over_Finite_Rings1","225115238_An_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Minimum_Distances_of_Extensions_of_BCH_Codes_Embedded_in_Semigroup_Rings","220657939_Algorithms_for_computing_parameters_of_graph-based_extensions_of_BCH_codes","38323485_Divisibility_properties_in_semigroup_rings","3081970_Srivastava_Codes"]}
