{"id":"323257946_Common_fixed_point_results_for_new_Ciric-type_rational_multivalued_F-contraction_with_an_application","abstract":"In this article, common fixed point theorems for a pair of multivalued mappings satisfying a new Ciric-type rational F-contraction condition in complete dislocated metric spaces are established. An example is constructed to illustrate our results. An application to the system of integral equations is presented to support the usability of proved results. Our results combine, extend and infer several comparable results in the existing literature.
