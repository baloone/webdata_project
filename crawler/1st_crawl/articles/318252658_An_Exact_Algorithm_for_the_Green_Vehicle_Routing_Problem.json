{"id":"318252658_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Green_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","abstract":"We propose an exact algorithm for solving the green vehicle routing problem (G-VRP). The G-VRP models the optimal routing of an alternative fuel vehicle fleet to serve a set of geographically scattered customers. Vehicles' fuel autonomy and possible refueling stops en route are explicitly modeled and maximum duration constraints are imposed on each vehicle route. We model the G-VRP as a set partitioning problem in which columns represent feasible routes corresponding to simple circuits in a multigraph. Each node in the multigraph represents one customer and each arc between two customers represents a nondominated path through a set of refueling stations visited by a vehicle when traveling directly between the two customers. We strengthen the set partitioning formulation by adding valid inequalities including κ-path cuts and describe a method for separating them.We provide computational results on benchmark instances showing that the algorithm can optimally solve instances with up to ∼110 customers.","authors":["Juho Andelmin","Enrico Bartolini"],"meta":["July 2017Transportation Science 51(4)","DOI:10.1287/trsc.2016.0734","Project: Exact and heuristic algorithms for vehicle routing problems with refueling stops"],"references":["332612516_A_multi-start_local_search_heuristic_for_the_Green_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_based_on_a_multigraph_reformulation","309729602_A_multi-space_sampling_heuristic_for_the_green_vehicle_routing_problem","309621232_Exact_Algorithms_for_Electric_Vehicle-Routing_Problems_with_Time_Windows","294107395_50th_Anniversary_Invited_Article-Goods_Distribution_with_Electric_Vehicles_Review_and_Research_Perspectives","290429368_The_Electric_Fleet_Size_and_Mix_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows_and_Recharging_Stations","284275352_The_green_vehicle_routing_problem_A_heuristic_based_exact_solution_approach","275343249_An_adaptive_VNS_algorithm_for_vehicle_routing_problems_with_intermediate_stops","273478235_Routing_a_mixed_fleet_of_electric_and_conventional_vehicles","271771889_Optimal_Vehicle_Routing_with_Lower_and_Upper_Bounds_on_Route_Durations","270883447_The_Electric_Vehicle-Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows_and_Recharging_Stations","267202427_The_Recharging_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","266677862_A_heuristic_approach_for_the_green_vehicle_routing_problem_with_multiple_technologies_and_partial_recharges","266476598_Multi-Objective_Optimization_Using_Evolutionary_Algorithms","265704281_Routing_a_vehicle_with_the_limitation_of_fuel","262411326_New_State-Space_Relaxations_for_Solving_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows"]}
