{"id":"353105156_Building_predictive_signaling_models_by_perturbing_yeast_cells_with_time-varying_stimulations_resulting_in_distinct_signaling_responses","abstract":"This protocol provides a step-by-step approach to perturb single cells with time-varying stimulation profiles, collect distinct signaling responses, and use these to infer a system of ordinary differential equations to capture and predict dynamics of protein-protein regulation in signal transduction pathways. The models are validated by predicting the signaling activation upon new cell stimulation conditions. In comparison to using standard step-like stimulations, application of diverse time-varying cell stimulations results in better inference of model parameters and substantially improves model predictions.\nFor complete details on the use and results of this protocol, please refer to Jashnsaz et al.
