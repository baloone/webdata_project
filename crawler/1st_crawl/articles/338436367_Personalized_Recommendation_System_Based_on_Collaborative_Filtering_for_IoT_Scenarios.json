{"id":"338436367_Personalized_Recommendation_System_Based_on_Collaborative_Filtering_for_IoT_Scenarios","abstract":"Recommendation technology is an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT) services, which can provide better service for users and help users get information anytime, anywhere. However, the traditional recommendation algorithms cannot meet user's fast and accurate recommended requirements in the IoT environment. In the face of a large-volume data, the method of finding neighborhood by comparing whole user information will result in a low recommendation efficiency. In addition, the traditional recommendation system ignores the inherent connection between user's preference and time. In reality, the interest of the user varies over time. Recommendation system should provide users accurate and fast with the change of time. To address this, we propose a novel recommendation model based on time correlation coefficient and an improved K-means with cuckoo search (CSK-means), called TCCF. The clustering method can cluster similar users together for further quick and accurate recommendation. Moreover, an effective and personalized recommendation model based on preference pattern (PTCCF) is designed to improve the quality of TCCF. It can provide a higher quality recommendation by analyzing the user's behaviors. The extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets of MovieLens and Douban, and the precision of our model have improved about 5.2% compared with the MCoC model. Systematic experimental results have demonstrated our models TCCF and PTCCF are effective for IoT scenarios.","authors":["Zhihua Cui","Xianghua Xu","Fei Xue","Xingjuan Cai"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE
