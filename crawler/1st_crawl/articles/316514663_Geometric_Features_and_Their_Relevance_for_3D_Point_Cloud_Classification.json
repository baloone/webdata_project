{"id":"316514663_Geometric_Features_and_Their_Relevance_for_3D_Point_Cloud_Classification","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the automatic interpretation of 3D point cloud data in terms of associating a class label to each 3D point.\nWhile much effort has recently been spent on this research topic, little attention has been paid to the influencing factors that affect the\nquality of the derived classification results. For this reason, we investigate fundamental influencing factors making geometric features\nmore or less relevant with respect to the classification task. We present a framework which consists of five components addressing\npoint sampling, neighborhood recovery, feature extraction, classification and feature relevance assessment. To analyze the impact of\nthe main influencing factors which are represented by the given point sampling and the selected neighborhood type, we present the\nresults derived with different configurations of our framework for a commonly used benchmark dataset for which a reference labeling\nwith respect to three structural classes (linear structures, planar structures and volumetric structures) as well as a reference labeling\nwith respect to five semantic classes (Wire, Pole/Trunk, Façade, Ground and Vegetation) is available.","authors":["Martin Weinmann","Boris Jutzi","Clément Mallet","Michael Weinmann"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-1-W1-157-2017"],"references":["307531922_CLASSIFICATION_OF_AIRBORNE_LASER_SCANNING_DATA_USING_GEOMETRIC_MULTI-SCALE_FEATURES_AND_DIFFERENT_NEIGHBOURHOOD_TYPES","305083748_Advancing_feature_selection_research","303801191_Classification_of_airborne_laser_scanning_data_using_geometric_multi-scale_features_and_different_neighbourhood_types","275771905_Role_of_dimensionality_reduction_in_segment-based_classification_of_damaged_building_roofs_in_airborne_Laser_scanning_data","272891971_Contextual_classification_of_point_cloud_data_by_exploiting_individual_3D_neighborhoods","307531656_Fast_semantic_segmentation_of_3d_point_clouds_with_strongly_varying_density","302204208_On_the_mean_accuracy_of_statistical_pattern_recognizers","301542305_Reconstruction_and_Analysis_of_3D_Scenes_-_From_Irregularly_Distributed_3D_Points_to_Object_Classes","288906520_Random_forests","278648951_Decision_Forests_for_Computer_Vision_and_Medical_Image_Analysis"]}
