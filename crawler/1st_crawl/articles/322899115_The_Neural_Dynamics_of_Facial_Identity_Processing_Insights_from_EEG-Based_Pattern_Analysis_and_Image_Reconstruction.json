{"id":"322899115_The_Neural_Dynamics_of_Facial_Identity_Processing_Insights_from_EEG-Based_Pattern_Analysis_and_Image_Reconstruction","abstract":"Uncovering the neural dynamics of facial identity processing along with its representational basis\n12 outlines a major endeavor in the study of visual processing. To this end, here we record human\n13 electroencephalography (EEG) data associated with viewing face stimuli; then, we exploit spatiotemporal\n14 EEG information to determine the neural correlates of facial identity representations and to reconstruct the\n15 appearance of the corresponding stimuli. Our findings indicate that multiple temporal intervals support:\n16 facial identity classification, face space estimation, visual feature extraction and image reconstruction. In\n17 particular, we note that both classification and reconstruction accuracy peak in the proximity of the N170\n18 component. Further, aggregate data from a larger interval (50-650 ms after stimulus onset) support robust\n19 reconstruction results, consistent with the availability of distinct visual information over time. Thus,\n20 theoretically, our findings shed light on the time course of face processing while, methodologically, they\n21 demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based image reconstruction.","authors":["Dan Nemrodov","Matthias Niemeier","Ashutosh Patel","Adrian Nestor"],"meta":["February 2018eNeuro 5(1)","DOI:10.1523/ENEURO.0358-17.2018"],"references":["311941250_Spatiotemporal_dynamics_of_similarity-based_neural_representations_of_facial_identity","303879760_Decoding_Dynamic_Brain_Patterns_from_Evoked_Responses_A_Tutorial_on_Multivariate_Pattern_Analysis_Applied_to_Time_Series_Neuroimaging_Data","289535294_Are_Face_and_Object_Recognition_Independent_A_Neurocomputational_Modeling_Exploration","288686232_Feature-based_face_representations_and_image_reconstruction_from_behavioral_and_neural_data","281812228_A_Representational_Similarity_Analysis_of_the_Dynamics_of_Object_Processing_Using_Single-Trial_EEG_Classification","269283159_Dynamic_Encoding_of_Face_Information_in_the_Human_Fusiform_Gyrus","317305790_The_Code_for_Facial_Identity_in_the_Primate_Brain","307999435_Contributions_of_feature_shapes_and_surface_cues_to_the_recognition_and_neural_representation_of_facial_identity","297742492_The_time_course_of_individual_face_recognition_A_pattern_analysis_of_ERP_signals","260995540_Neural_portraits_of_perception_Reconstructing_face_images_from_evoked_brain_activity"]}
