{"id":"331980138_Phraseology_and_Style_in_Subgenres_of_the_Novel_A_Synthesis_of_Corpus_and_Literary_Perspectives","abstract":"This edited book represents the first cohesive attempt to describe the literary genres of late-twentieth-century fiction in terms of lexico-grammatical patterns. Drawing on the PhraseoRom international project on the phraseology of contemporary novels, the contributed chapters combine literary studies with corpus linguistics to analyse fantasy, romance, crime, historical and science fiction in French and English. The authors offer new insights into long-standing debates on genre distinction and the hybridization of genres by deploying a new, interdisciplinary methodology. Sitting at the intersection of literature and linguistics, with a firm grounding in the digital humanities, this book will be of particular relevance to literary scholars, corpus stylists, contrastivists and lexicologists, as well as general readers with an interest in twentieth-century genre fiction.\n\nIva Novakova is Professor of French and Contrastive Linguistics at the Université Grenoble Alpes, France.\n\nDirk Siepmann is Professor of English language teaching at the Institute of English and American Studies, Osnabrück University, Germany.","authors":["Iva Novakova","Dirk Siepmann"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-23744-8","ISBN: 978-3-030-23743-1"],"references":[]}
