{"id":"315857122_Attribute-Based_Access_Control_Scheme_in_Federated_IoT_Platforms","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) introduced the possibility to connect electronic things from everyday life to the Internet, while making them ubiquitously available. With advanced IoT services, based on a trusted federation among heterogeneous IoT platforms, new security problems (including authentication and authorization) emerge. This contribution aims at describing the main facets of the preliminary security architecture envisaged in the context of the symbIoTe project, recently launched by European Commission under the Horizon 2020 EU program. Our approach features distributed and decoupled mechanisms for authentication and authorization services in complex scenarios embracing heterogeneous and federated IoT platforms, by leveraging Attribute Based Access Control and token-based authorization techniques.","authors":["Savio Sciancalepore","Michał Pilc","Svenja Schröder","Giuseppe Bianchi"],"meta":["April 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-56877-5_8","Conference: International Workshop on Interoperability and Open-Source Solutions","Project: symbIoTe: symbiosis of smart objects across IoT environments"],"references":["313616838_Guide_to_attribute_based_access_control_ABAC_definition_and_considerations","306046857_Everything_You_Wanted_to_Know_About_Smart_Cities","275540220_IoT_Governance_Privacy_and_Security_Issues","270107935_Security_privacy_and_trust_in_Internet_of_Things_The_road_ahead","301888287_That_'Internet_of_Things'_Thing","269196979_Macaroons_Cookies_with_Contextual_Caveats_for_Decentralized_Authorization_in_the_Cloud","261104622_A_Survey_on_Trust_Management_for_Internet_of_Things","258240564_Access_Control_in_Cloud_Computing_Environment","8228496_The_Internet_of_Things"]}
