{"id":"265603010_Strong_Converse_Exponent_for_Classical-Quantum_Channel_Coding","abstract":"We determine the exact strong converse exponent of classical-quantum channel\ncoding, for every rate above the Holevo capacity. Our form of the exponent is\nan exact analogue of Arimoto's, given as a transform of the R\\'enyi capacities\nwith parameters $\\alpha>1$. It is important to note that, unlike in the\nclassical case, there are many inequivalent ways to define the R\\'enyi\ndivergence of states, and hence the R\\'enyi capacities of channels. Our\nexponent is in terms of the R\\'enyi capacities corresponding to a version of\nthe R\\'enyi divergences that has been introduced recently in [M\\\"uller-Lennert,\nDupuis, Szehr, Fehr and Tomamichel, J. Math. Phys. 54, 122203, (2013)], and\n[Wilde, Winter, Yang, Commun. Math. Phys. 331, (2014)]. Our result adds to the\ngrowing body of evidence that this new version is the natural definition for\nthe purposes of strong converse problems.","authors":["Milan Mosonyi","Tomohiro Ogawa"],"meta":["October 2017Communications in Mathematical Physics 355(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00220-017-2928-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["286513564_On_Variational_Expressions_for_Quantum_Relative_Entropies","316541206_Conditional_expectation_in_an_operator_algebra_ii","316323121_Coding_Theorems_of_Information_Theory","309279461_Correlation_detection_and_an_operational_interpretation_of_the_Renyi_mutual_information","303822941_Concavity_of_certain_matrix_trace_and_norm_functions","303436389_Strong_converse_theorems_in_quantum_information_theory","301848733_On_the_Concavity_of_Auxiliary_Function_in_Classical-Quantum_Channels","283788393_Two_Approaches_to_Obtain_the_Strong_Converse_Exponent_of_Quantum_Hypothesis_Testing_for_General_Sequences_of_Quantum_States","281211427_Elementary_proof_for_Sion's_minimax_theorem","280698300_Inequality_with_applications_in_statistical_mechanics","267118543_Sandwiched_Renyi_divergence_satisfies_data_processing_inequality","275251015_Coding_Theorems_for_Compound_Problems_via_Quantum_Renyi_Divergences","273513515_a-z-Renyi_relative_entropies","266858601_Capacity_of_a_quantum_communication_channel","266453913_A_survey_of_certain_trace_inequalities"]}
