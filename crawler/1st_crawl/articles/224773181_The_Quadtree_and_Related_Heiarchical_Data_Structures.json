{"id":"224773181_The_Quadtree_and_Related_Heiarchical_Data_Structures","abstract":"A tutorial survey is presented of the quadtree and related hierarchical data structures. They are based on the principle of recursive decomposition. The emphasis is on the representation of data used in applications in image processing, computer graphics, geographic information systems, and robotics. There is a greater emphasis on region data (ie, two-dimensional shapes) and to a lesser extent on point, curvilinear, and three-dimensional data. A number of operations in which such data structures find use are examined in greater detail.-Author","authors":["Hanan Samet"],"meta":["June 1984ACM Computing Surveys 16:187-260","DOI:10.1145/356924.356930","SourceDBLP"],"references":["246974424_Normalized_quadtrees_with_respect_to_translations","318494292_Closest-Point_Problem","314815292_Storage_mappings_for_multidimensional_linear_dynamic_hashing","313312310_Adaptive_Pel_Location_Coding_for_Bi-Level_Facsimile_Signals","313100215_Tree_and_pyramid_structures_for_coding_hexagonally_sampling_binary_images","313009043_Sequential_operations_in_digital_picture_processing","312895984_Linear_octrees_for_fast_processing_of_three_dimensional_objects","292756211_Transformations_for_extracting_new_descriptions_of_shape_models_for_the_perception_of_speech_and_visual_form","287444813_Notes_on_data_structuring","281891677_A_method_minimum-redundancy_codes","279043538_Applications_of_a_Planar_Separator_Theorem","277502001_Region_representation_Quadtrees_from_boundary_codes","266549462_Patterns_and_search_statistics","265063102_Spatial1_y_referenced_of_processing_methods_raster_and_vector_data","258023740_A_transformation_for_extracting_new_descriptors_of_shape","256976496_Pictorial_feature_distortion_in_a_pyramid","248848344_Pattern_Classification_and_Scene_Analysis","247817148_The_connected_component_labeling_algorithm_on_the_NON-VON_supercomputer","247305983_Quadtree_structures_for_image_processing","246697184_Linear_octree_for_fast_processing_of_three-dimensional_objects","245915256_DF-expression_of_binary-valued_picture_and_its_relation_to_other_pyramidal_representations","245791838_Control_strategy_for_an_expert_vision_system_using_quadtree_refinement","243002036_Oct-tree_and_their_use_in_representing_three-dimensional_objects","243001928_Image_transmission_with_gross_information_first","243001885_Vectorization_of_raster_images_using_hierarchical_methods","243001875_Linear_transformation_of_pictures_represented_by_quad_trees","243001818_Ray_Casting_for_Modeling_Solids","242825737_Short_Notes_Comment_on_'The_Explicit_Quad_Tree_as_a_Structure_for_Computer_Graphics'","242678487_A_Computer_Oriented_Geodetic_Data_Base_and_a_New_Technique_in_File_Sequencing","242624770_Organization_of_geographical_data_with_quad_trees_and_least_square_approximation","242599880_A_hierarchical_data_structure_for_image_processing","242561480_a_vlsi_pyramid_machine_for_hierarchical_parallel_image_processing","242536076_Calculations_of_geometric_properties_using_quadtrees","242531488_Using_quadtrees_to_represent_polygonal_maps","242529706_Raster_Processing_An_Alternative_Approach_to_Automated_Cartographic_Data_Handling","242522998_Representation_of_threedimensional_objects","242511515_Introduction_to_the_theory_of_switching_circuits","242506142_Digital_model_for_three-dimensional_surface_representation","242500045_Segmentation_and_estlmatlon_of_image_region_propertles_through_cooperative_hlerarchmal_computation","242490747_Two_Hierarchial_Linear_Feature_Representations_Edge_Pyramids_And_Edge_Quadtrees","242482360_The_structural_and_algorithmic_basis_of_a_geographic_data_base","242450243_Pattern_recognition_and_geometrical_complexity","242420350_Ray_casting_for_modeling_solids_computer_graphics_and_image_processing","242403984_The_space_efficiency_of_quadtrees","242385342_Comment_on_'the_explicit_quad_tree_as_a_structure_for_computer_graphics","240380701_Use_of_quadtrees_for_image_segmentation","240200808_Quadtree_construction_of_binary_images_by_dyadic_array_transformations","239595328_Efficient_computation_and_data_structures_for_graphics","239578000_Computing_perimeters_of_images_represented_by_quadtrees","239553570_Multdlmenslonal_paging_for_efficient_database_querying","238799182_Using_Quadtrees_to_Smooth_Images","238757948_An_Algorithm_for_Finding_Best_Matches_in_Logarithmic_Expected_Time","238709043_Neighbor_finding_techniques_for_images_represented_by_quadtrees","238686488_A_B-Tree_structure_for_large_quadtree","238670146_A_Theory_of_the_Cartographic_Line"]}
