{"id":"321093251_Building_Data_Warehouse_for_Diseases_Registry_First_Step_for_Clinical_Data_Warehouse","abstract":"Almost all the Decision Makers in medical path need a good platform which providing analytical results to use them in order to support their decisions. Due to vast amount of patient's records in Electronic Health Record (EHR) rather than Electronic Medical Records (EMR), Medical data can be used to get valuable information to support decisions of specialists in clinical path. Clinical data warehouse can combine different sources of clinical data into single repository and use it to produce analytical information to support decisions. Since Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) can be used in analyzing data and find the relationship between many factors and provide good view of data from many points of view so using data warehousing and OLAP techniques is the good choice for helping professionals and analysts in finding their goals. We will use diseases registry data (Part from EMR) to design and implement data warehouse as the first step that could be used later by OLAP or Data Mining to support Clinical Decisions. In this work, we combined different sources of diseases registry data into single repository.","authors":["Alaa Khalaf","Taleb Obaid"],"meta":["November 2013International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research 4(11):636-640","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3061599"],"references":["345895234_Building_and_Maintaining_a_Data_Warehouse","284090365_Clinical_decision_support_using_OLAP_with_data_mining","270276876_Building_the_Data_Warehouse","253873589_Teaching_Effective_Methodologies_to_Design_a_Data_Warehouse","247826297_The_Data_Warehouse_Toolkit_The_Complete_Guide_to_Dimensional_Modeling","242502296_OLAP_solutions_building_multidimensional_information_systems","229049693_A_Data_Warehouse_Model_for_Micro-Level_Decision_Making_in_Higher_Education","224215743_Evaluating_a_Data_Warehouse_for_Lymphoma_Diagnosis_and_Treatment_Decision_Support_System"]}
