Professional training of future computer science teachers requires them to know the range of tasks related to computer graphics, and the ability to accomplish them. The training of a computer science teacher goes beyond the task solution and demands that the teacher have the basic knowledge needed in the field of computer science and information technology, and especially in computer graphics. In addition to the traditional and fundamental tasks of teaching computer graphics, the teacher is faced with the use of computer graphics elements and their tools in their teaching. It should be noted that present trends in the digitalization of education have made such tasks fundamental to teaching. Based on the above, this article analyzes the need to teach computer graphics related to the activities of future computer science teachers, and possible methods of their solutions, and the field of use.","authors":["V.
