{"id":"261041723_VeMAC_A_novel_multichannel_MAC_protocol_for_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","abstract":"This paper introduces VeMAC, a novel multichannel TDMA MAC protocol designed specifically for a vehicular ad hoc network. The network has one control channel and multiple service channels. On the control channel nodes acquire time slots in a distributed way, while on the service channels nodes are assigned time slots in a centralized manner. VeMAC decreases the probability of transmission collisions caused by node mobility by assigning disjoint sets of time slots to vehicles moving in opposite directions and to road side units. Analysis and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of VeMAC and compare it to ADHOC MAC, an existing MAC protocol based on TDMA. It is shown that, for the same number of contending nodes and available time slots, nodes can acquire time slots on the control channel much faster in VeMAC than in ADHOC MAC, when the number of available time slots is sufficiently larger than the number of contending nodes.","authors":["Hassan Aboubakr Omar","Weihua Zhuang","li li"],"meta":["April 2011","DOI:10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928848","Conference: Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), 2011 IEEE Conference on"],"references":["220293296_ADHOC_MAC_New_MAC_Architecture_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks_Providing_Efficient_and_Reliable_Point-to-Point_and_Broadcast_Services","4195154_Impact_of_user_mobility_on_the_broadcast_service_efficiency_of_the_ADHOC_MAC_protocol","220557630_A_recursive_solution_to_an_occupancy_problem_resulting_from_TDM_radio_communication_application","4274553_A_Solicitation-based_IEEE_80211p_MAC_Protocol_for_Roadside_to_Vehicular_Networks","4062836_MAC_for_ad-hoc_inter-vehicle_network_services_and_performance","4048016_A_study_of_inter_vehicle_communication_scheme_allocating_PN_codes_to_the_location_on_the_road","3428005_A_Reliable_Link-Layer_Protocol_for_Robust_and_Scalable_Intervehicle_Communications"]}
