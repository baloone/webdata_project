{"id":"279920234_Automatic_assessment_in_engineering_mathematics_evaluation_of_the_impact","abstract":"We study the impact of a web-based automatic assessment system STACK in teaching mathematics for engineering students. We describe several uses of automatic assessment which have been tested in Aalto University during the past few years. We measure the impact of e-assessment to learning outcomes in engineering mathematics. This question is motivated by the practical need to show that the system is, in general, worth the effort invested but also our wish to better understand the learning process. The secondary aim is to obtain information about the different factors affecting the learning outcomes that would be useful in further improving mathematics teaching. Our goal is to show that such system can significantly activate students, allow much increased flexibility in practical arrange- ments of teaching, and facilitate innovative practices in, e.g., diagnostic testing and grading studentsâ€™ work.","authors":["Antti Rasila","Linda Havola","Helle Majander","Jarmo Malinen"],"meta":["December 2010","Conference: ReflekTori Symposium of Engineering EducationAt: Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland","Projects: Computer-aided teachingAbacus Material Bank"],"references":["242324944_TTYn_insinoorimatematiikan_opiskelijoiden_asenteet_taidot_ja_opetuksen_kehittaminen","228935515_Assessing_mathematics_automatically_using_computer_algebra_and_the_internet","228386934_Automatic_assessment_of_mathematics_exercises_Experiences_and_future_prospects","228379599_STACK_making_many_fine_judgements_rapidly","222863721_Blended_Learning_Uncovering_Its_Transformative_Potential_in_Higher_Education","288525740_Research_design_Qualitative_quantitative_and_mixed_methods_approaches","268264031_Matematiikan_verkko-opetus_osana_perusopetuksen_kehittamista_Teknillisessa_korkeakoulussa","230785204_Teaching_for_Quality_Learning_at_University_Society_for_Research_into_Higher_Education","228602358_Success_Factors_for_e-Assessment_in_Computer_Science_Education","228328446_A_Survey_of_Automated_Assessment_Approaches_for_Programming_Assignments"]}
