{"id":"278619511_A_5D_gyrokinetic_full-_global_semi-Lagrangian_code_for_flux-driven_ion_turbulence_simulations","abstract":"This paper addresses non-linear gyrokinetic simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence in tokamak plasmas. The electrostatic Gysela code is one of the few international 5D gyrokinetic codes able to perform global, full-f and flux-driven simulations. Its has also the numerical originality of being based on a semi-Lagrangian (SL) method. This reference paper for the Gysela code presents a complete description of its multi-ion species version including: (i) numerical scheme, (ii) high level of parallelism up to 500k cores and (iii) conservation law properties.","authors":["Virginie Grandgirard","Jeremie Abiteboul","Julien Bigot","T.
