{"id":"221305954_Development_and_Application_of_Knowledge_Engineering_Based_on_Ontology","abstract":"When carrying out knowledge representation, Ontology of information in an abstract manner similar to semantic networks, can be used with a labeled directed graph to sign, but the Ontology is more focused on specific areas that the overall content. Ontology development and application of this paper gave a brief overview of research: first introduced predicate logic-based ontology representation language and graph-based ontology representation language and to introduce the main body of the current development environment and tools; second describes the development of the relatively forming body methods and propose a ontology-based object-oriented development of a simple process; concluded the ontology development problems and development direction.","authors":["Qiu Wei"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1109/WKDD.2010.35","SourceDBLP","Conference: Third International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, WKDD 2010, Phuket, Thailand, 9-10 January 2010"],"references":["302937543_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications","2288533_Methodology_for_the_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Ontologies","286751706_Principles_of_Categorization_in_Cognition_and_Categorization","285705831_SNOMED_clinical_terms","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications","243776794_Swartout_Enabling_technology_for_knowledge_sharing","242442798_Principles_of_Categorization","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies","220695893_Object-Oriented_Modeling_And_Design","2601385_Gruninger_M_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications_Knowledge_Eng_Rev_112_93-155"]}
