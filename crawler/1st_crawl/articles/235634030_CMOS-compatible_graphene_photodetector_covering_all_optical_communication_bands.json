{"id":"235634030_CMOS-compatible_graphene_photodetector_covering_all_optical_communication_bands","abstract":"Optical interconnects are becoming attractive alternatives to electrical\nwiring in intra- and inter-chip communication links. Particularly, the\nintegration with silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)\ntechnology has received considerable interest due to the ability of\ncost-effective integration of electronics and optics on a single chip. While\nsilicon enables the realization of optical waveguides and passive components,\nthe integration of another, optically absorbing, material is required for\nphotodetection. Germanium or compound semiconductors are traditionally used for\nthis purpose; their integration with silicon technology, however, faces major\nchallenges. Recently, graphene has emerged as a viable alternative for\noptoelectronic applications, including photodetection. Here, we demonstrate an\nultra-wideband CMOS-compatible photodetector based on graphene. We achieve\nmulti-gigahertz operation over all fiber-optic telecommunication bands, beyond\nthe wavelength range of strained germanium photodetectors, whose responsivity\nis limited by their bandgap. Our work complements the recent demonstration of a\nCMOS-integrated graphene electro-optical modulator, paving the way for\ncarbon-based optical interconnects.","authors":["Andreas Pospischil","Markus Humer","Marco Mercurio Furchi","Dominic Bachmann"],"meta":["February 2013Nature Photonics 7(11)","DOI:10.1038/NPHOTON.2013.240","SourcearXiv"],"references":["284146851_Electric_Field_Effect_in_Atomically_Thin_Carbon_Films","234940552_High-performance_tensile-strained_Ge_p-i-n_photodetectors_on_a_Si_platform","232093111_Silver_nanoisland_enhanced_Raman_interaction_in_graphene","230825947_Graphene_field_effect_transistors_as_room-temperature_Terahertz_detectors","353615882_Polymer-Based_Optical_Waveguides_Materials_Processing_and_Devices","318310671_Raman_spectrum_of_graphene_and_graphene_layers","252772553_Ultra-High_Frequency_Linear_Fiber_Optics_Systems","249654053_Intraband_Optical_Transitions_in_Graphene","235773403_Increased_Responsivity_of_Suspended_Graphene_Photodetectors","232086616_Switching_energy_limits_of_waveguide-coupled_graphene-on-graphene_optical_modulators"]}
