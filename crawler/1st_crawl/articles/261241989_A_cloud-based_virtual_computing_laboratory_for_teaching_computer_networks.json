{"id":"261241989_A_cloud-based_virtual_computing_laboratory_for_teaching_computer_networks","abstract":"This paper presents a novel 'Cloud-based' solution for teaching computer networks in an educational context. One key advantage of the system is its ability to commission and decommission virtual infrastructures comprised of routers, switches and virtual machines on demand. It makes use of hardware located in different physical locations, VMWare software to manage the virtual resources and NetLab+ to manage the configuration of multiple different virtual scenarios. The key features of the cloud infrastructure are described and evaluated.","authors":["Razvan-Ioan Dinita","George Wilson","A.
