{"id":"316661206_Metacognitive_Skills_of_Malaysian_Students_in_Non-Routine_Mathematical_Problem_Solving","abstract":"Metacognitive skills play an important role in solving mathematical problems. However, there is a lack of empirical studies on the role of metacognitive skills in solving mathematical problems, particularly non-routine ones. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify students' metacognitive skills and the impact of such skills on non-routine mathematical problem solving. By using a quantitative method, a total of 304 students in Johor Bahru district were involved in the study. A Self-Monitoring Questionnaire (SMQ) and a mathematical test were used in data collection. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics such as frequency, percentage, mean, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Results showed that the level of the students' performance in solving non-routine mathematical problems was very low. There was also a significant difference in the metacognitive skills among students with different performance levels in solving non-routine mathematical problems, and we concluded that these metacognitive skills should be emphasised in this process.","authors":["Abdul Halim Abdullah","Sharifah Nurarfah S.
