{"id":"289549941_Metric_aspects_of_N_-graphs","abstract":"We first define length, distance, radius, eccentricity, path cover and edge cover of an N -graph. Then we introduce the concept of self centered N -graphs and investigate some of their important properties. We also establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a complete N -graph to have an N -bridge.","authors":["Muhammad Akram","Y.B.
