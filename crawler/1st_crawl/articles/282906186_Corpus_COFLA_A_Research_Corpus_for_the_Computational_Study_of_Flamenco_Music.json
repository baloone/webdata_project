{"id":"282906186_Corpus_COFLA_A_Research_Corpus_for_the_Computational_Study_of_Flamenco_Music","abstract":"Flamenco is a music tradition from Southern Spain which attracts a growing\ncommunity of enthusiasts around the world. Its unique melodic and rhythmic\nelements, the typically spontaneous and improvised interpretation and its\ndiversity regarding styles make this still largely undocumented art form a\nparticularly interesting material for musicological studies. In prior works it\nhas already been demonstrated that research on computational analysis of\nflamenco music, despite it being a relatively new field, can provide powerful\ntools for the discovery and diffusion of this genre. In this paper we present\ncorpusCOFLA, a data framework for the development of such computational tools.\nThe proposed collection of audio recordings and meta-data serves as a pool for\ncreating annotated subsets which can be used in development and evaluation of\nalgorithms for specific music information retrieval tasks. First, we describe\nthe design criteria for the corpus creation and then provide various examples\nof subsets drawn from the corpus. We showcase possible research applications in\nthe context of computational study of flamenco music and give perspectives\nregarding further development of the corpus.","authors":["Nadine Kroher","José Miguel Díaz-Báñez","Joaquin Mora","Emilia Gómez"],"meta":["October 2015Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage 9(2)","DOI:10.1145/2875428","SourcearXiv","Project: MIR for Flamenco"],"references":["285236023_Discovering_repeated_patterns_in_music_state_of_knowledge_challenges_perspectives","282906096_Automatic_Transcription_of_Flamenco_Singing_From_Polyphonic_Music_Recordings","279804346_Discovery_of_Repeated_Vocal_Patterns_in_Polyphonic_Audio_a_Case_Study_on_Flamenco_Music","301953348_An_Efficient_DTW-Based_Approach_for_Melodic_Similarity_in_Flamenco_Singing","301444121_Creating_Corpora_for_Computational_Research_in_Arab-Andalusian_Music","289422008_Creating_research_corpora_for_the_computational_study_of_music_The_case_of_the_CompMusic_project","286155342_Bridging_the_audio-symbolic_gap_The_discovery_of_repeated_note_content_directly_from_polyphonic_music_audio","281895699_Melodic_Contour_and_Mid-Level_Global_Features_Applied_to_the_Analysis_of_Flamenco_Cantes","281328191_Towards_a_better_Definition_of_Annotated_MIR_Corpora","281325722_Comparative_Study_of_Singing_Voice_Detection_Methods"]}
