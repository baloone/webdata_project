{"id":"307558328_Dynamic_Key_Matrix_of_Hill_Cipher_Using_Genetic_Algorithm","abstract":"Genetic algorithms can solve complex problems, including the problems of cryptography. What problems often occur on the Hill Cipher is the waste of time to determine the numbers that are used in the encryption process. In the encryption process, it is not a problem if the key is derived from any number. However, the problem is ciphertext cannot be returned to the original message. The key that is used must have the determinant is 1. To find the value of it is something that takes time if it must be done manually. Due to the entered value to the Hill Cipher is random, Genetic algorithms can be used to optimize the search time. By using this algorithm, the determinant calculation will be more accurate and faster. The result achieved is the program can specify some combination of numbers that can be used as the encryption key Hill Cipher and it can reject the unnecessary numbers.","authors":["Andysah Putera Utama Siahaan","Robbi Rahim"],"meta":["September 2016International Journal of Security and its Applications 10(8):173-180","DOI:10.14257/ijsia.2016.10.8.15"],"references":["320190895_Affine_cipher_cryptanalysis_using_genetic_algorithms","305684147_Genetic_Algorithm_in_Hill_Cipher_Encryption","305616524_Three-Pass_Protocol_Concept_in_Hill_Cipher_Encryption_Technique","305268410_RC4_Technique_in_Visual_Cryptography_RGB_Image_Encryption","294582054_A_Triple_Hill_Cipher_Algorithm_Proposed_to_Increase_the_Security_of_Encrypted_Binary_Dataand_its_Implementation_Using_FPGA","279973968_Proposed_Triple_Hill_Cipher_Algorithm_for_Increasing_the_Security_Level_of_Encrypted_Binary_Data_and_its_Implementation_Using_FPGA","276381791_A_Realizable_Quantum_Three-Pass_Protocol_Authentication_Based_on_Hill-Cipher_Algorithm","314374239_Cryptanalysis_of_a_Hill_cipher_using_genetic_algorithm","288726070_Cryptography_A_new_approach_of_classical_hill_cipher","271156232_A_Secured_Message_Transaction_Approach_by_Dynamic_Hill_Cipher_Generation_and_Digest_Concatenation"]}
