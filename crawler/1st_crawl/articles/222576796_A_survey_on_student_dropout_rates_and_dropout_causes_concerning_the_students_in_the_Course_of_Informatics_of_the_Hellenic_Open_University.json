{"id":"222576796_A_survey_on_student_dropout_rates_and_dropout_causes_concerning_the_students_in_the_Course_of_Informatics_of_the_Hellenic_Open_University","abstract":"This paper focuses on university-level education offered by methods of distance learning in the field of computers and aims at the investigation of the main causes for student dropouts. The presented study is based on the students of the Course of “Informatics”, Faculty of Science and Technology of the Hellenic Open University and investigates the particularities of education provided through the use of computers and technology in general. This paper presents information about the students' profile, the use of computer technology, the percentage of dropouts, as well as a classification of the reasons for dropouts based on interviews with the students. The study shows that dropouts are correlated with the use of technological means and, based on this fact, the Hellenic Open University implemented interventions in the use of such means. It also proves that a correlation exists between dropouts and students' age, but not gender, although female students are more reluctant to start following a course. However, it is also shown that female students' commitment to a course is stronger and thus, they do not drop out as easily as male students do. Furthermore, the results of this study strongly correlate dropouts to the existence of previous education in the field of Informatics or to working with computers, but not to the degree of specialisation in computers. Finally, the paper presents the reasons provided by the students for drooping out, with the main reasons being the inability to estimate the time required for university-level studies and the perceived difficulty of the computers course.","authors":["Michalis Xenos","Christos Pierrakeas","P.
