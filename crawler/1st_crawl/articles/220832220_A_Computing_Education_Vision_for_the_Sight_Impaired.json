{"id":"220832220_A_Computing_Education_Vision_for_the_Sight_Impaired","abstract":"Vision is the main sensory modality employed in learning. Teaching materials in the areas of information technology and computer engineering are highly visual in nature and vision impaired students find it increasingly difficult to access and process these visuo-centric learning materials and on-line delivery.This paper describes a research project undertaken by Curtin University in conjunction with Cisco Systems and the Association for the Blind WA to identify tools and techniques appropriate for vision-impaired students studying computing at tertiary level. It investigates considerations and learning characteristics of sight impaired students, and also describes the aims of the project, the approach being undertaken to identify and apply alternative modalities. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on progress so far including some of the teaching aids used to assist learning complex concepts usually delivered by visual means.","authors":["Iain Murray","Helen Armstrong"],"meta":["January 2004","SourceDBLP","Conference: Sixth Australasian Computing Education Conference (ACE 2004), Dunedin, New Zealand, January 18-22, 2004"],"references":["255644403_Providing_Learning_Support_for_Blind_and_Visually_Impaired_Students_Undertaking_Fieldwork_and_Related_Activities","247779221_Blind_and_Sighted_Children's_Spatial_Knowledge_of_Their_Home_Environments","12153720_The_Development_of_Young_Children_With_Retinoblastoma","279410259_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Landscapes_of_Classroom_Learning_Environments","225879815_Teacher_Interpersonal_Behaviour_Classroom_Environment_and_Student_Outcomes_in_Primary_Mathematics_in_Singapore","31841960_Learning_and_Memory_The_Brain_in_Action_M_Sprenger","12469746_Early_motor_development_of_blind_children"]}
