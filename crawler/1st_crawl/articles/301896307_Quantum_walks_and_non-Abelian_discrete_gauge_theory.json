{"id":"301896307_Quantum_walks_and_non-Abelian_discrete_gauge_theory","abstract":"A new family of DTQWs on the line is introduced, which presents an exact discrete $U(N)$ gauge invariance. It is shown that the continuous limit of these DTQWs, when it exists, coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to usual $U(N)$ gauge fields in $2D$ spacetime. A discrete generalization of the usual $U(N)$ curvature is also constructed. An alternate interpretation of these results in terms of superimposed $U(1)$ Maxwell fields and $SU(N)$ gauge fields is discussed in the Appendix. Numerical simulations are also presented, which explore the convergence of the DTQWs towards their continuous limit and which also compare the DTQWs with classical ({\\sl i.e.} non-quantum) motions in classical $SU(2)$ fields. The results presented in this article open up the possibility of performing quantum simulation of generic Yang-Mills gauge theories through DTQWs.","authors":["Pablo Arnault","Giuseppe Di Molfetta","Marc-Etienne Brachet","F.
