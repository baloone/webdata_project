{"id":"342928892_Inverse_Kinematic_Simulation_of_Industrial_Robotic_Manipulators_Using_RecurDyn_and_Matlab_with_Experiment_Verification","abstract":"The simulation and application of industrial robots has developed very quickly in recent decades. Along with the development of computer science, a lot of softwares to perform dynamic simulation have been created. The results of simulation can be used for layout evaluation, kinematic, dynamic study, off-line programming to avoid obstacle and for design mechanical structure of robots. A co-simulation of 2R industrial robots have been performed by Recurdyn and Matlab. The input parameters are executed under Matlab, and then exported to Recurdyn environment. Kinematic parameters will be executed by RecurDyn then exported to Matlab. The main tasks of this paper are performing 2R robotic manipulator kinematic simulation in two postures with the same trajectory and the same time. Thus, the result of simulation can be compared with theories. Finally, a real 2R robot model was used to verify the trajectory with CAE simulation.","authors":["Yunn-Lin Hwang","Jung Kuang Cheng","Thanh Dat Pham"],"meta":["July 2020Applied Mechanics and Materials 900:35-43","DOI:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.900.35","Project: Dynamics"],"references":["328452101_Using_zero_moment_point_preview_control_formulation_to_generate_nonlinear_trajectories_of_walking_patterns_on_humanoid_robots","328258282_Using_zero_moment_point_preview_control_formulation_to_generate_nonlinear_trajectories_of_walking_patterns_on_humanoid_robots","298208505_Recursive_Newton-Euler_formulation_for_flexible_dynamic_manufacturing_analysis_of_open-loop_robotic_systems","277620299_Dynamic_Analysis_and_Control_of_Multi-Body_Manufacturing_Systems_Based_on_Newton-Euler_Formulation","272618894_The_Dynamic_Analysis_of_Humanoid_Robot_System","269387170_Nonlinear_Recursive_Formulation_for_Kinematic_and_Dynamic_Analysis_of_Robotic_Manufacturing_Systems","242923691_Dynamic_Coupling_Between_the_Joint_and_Elastic_Coordinates_in_Flexible_Mechanism_Systems","267008884_Dynamics_of_multibody_systems_Reprint_of_the_2005_3rd_hardback_ed","220696459_Robotics_Vision_and_Control_-_Fundamental_Algorithms_in_MATLABR","220695644_Introduction_To_Robotics_Mechanics_Control"]}
