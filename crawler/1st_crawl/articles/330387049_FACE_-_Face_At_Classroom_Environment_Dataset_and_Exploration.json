{"id":"330387049_FACE_-_Face_At_Classroom_Environment_Dataset_and_Exploration","abstract":"The rapid development in face detection study has been greatly supported by the availability of large image datasets, which provide detailed annotations of faces on images. However, among a number of publicly accessible datasets, to our best knowledge, none of them are specifically created for academic applications. In this paper, we propose a systematic method in forming an image dataset tailored for classroom environment. We also made our dataset and its exploratory analyses publicly available. Studies in computer vision for academic application, such as an automated student attendance system, would benefit from our dataset.","authors":["Oscar Karnalim","Setia Budi","Sulaeman Santoso","Erico Darmawan Handoyo"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.1109/IPTA.2018.8608166","Conference: 2018 Eighth International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)At: Xi'an, China","Project: IBAtS - Image Based Attendance System"],"references":["311461423_Student_attendance_system_in_classroom_using_face_recognition_technique","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","323193340_Automated_classroom_monitoring_with_connected_visioning_system","322276713_The_openCV_library","321063271_Comparison_of_Visual_Datasets_for_Machine_Learning","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","317421167_An_efficient_automated_attendance_management_system_based_on_Eigen_Face_recognition","278664520_An_Improved_Labelling_for_the_INRIA_Person_Data_Set_for_Pedestrian_Detection","275156849_A_Survey_on_Face_Detection_in_the_wild_past_present_and_future","266298783_FDDB_A_Benchmark_for_Face_Detection_in_Unconstrained_Settings"]}
