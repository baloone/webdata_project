{"id":"313463653_A_3D_polar-radius-moment_invariant_as_a_shape_circularity_measure","abstract":"In this paper a novel and generalized circularity measure is proposed based on 3D polar-radius-moment invariant. We proved theoretically and verify experimentally that the proposed measure is invariant to scaling and rotation. Moreover, the proposed measure can be adapted to a fixed range for a suitable value of paccording to degree of accuracy and is generalized to satisfy different requirements in actual application. The experimental results show that the proposed measure can accord with human visual perception and consistently performs best in terms of retrieval efficiency in test datasets than other compared methods.","authors":["Zi-ping Ma","Jin-lin Ma","Bin Xiao","Ke Lu"],"meta":["February 2017Neurocomputing 259","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2016.09.124"],"references":["286235559_Ellipticity_and_Circularity_Measuring_via_Kullback-Leibler_Divergence","273579332_View-based_3D_object_retrieval_via_multi-modal_graph_learning","269728888_Hypergraph_based_feature_fusion_for_3-D_object_retrieval","225405567_Measuring_Elongation_from_Shape_Boundary","222656131_Measuring_linearity_of_planar_point_sets","220720898_Topology_matching_for_fully_automatic_similarity_estimation_of_3D_shapes","6720910_On_the_Orientability_of_Shapes","5276194_A_new_convexity_measure_for_polygons","2549913_Measuring_Shape_Ellipticity_Rectangularity_and_Triangularity","2536096_Polyhedral_Model_Retrieval_Using_Weighted_Point_Sets","303096023_Deep_Learning_Representation_using_Autoencoder_for_3D_Shape_Retrieval","283161447_Orthogonal_Moment-Based_Descriptors_for_Pose_Shape_Query_on_3D_Point_Cloud_Patches","277906757_3D_rotation_invariants_by_complex_moments","263319584_Efficient_View-Based_3-D_Object_Retrieval_via_Hypergraph_Learning","223698766_A_Hu_moment_invariant_as_a_shape_circularity_measure","222902010_A_symmetric_convexity_measure","222678940_Shape_retrieval_using_3D_Zernike_descriptors","222429298_Efficient_3D_Shape_Matching_and_Retrieval_using_a_Concrete_Radialized_Spherical_Projection_Representation","222354747_Measuring_Sigmoidality","221161561_3D_Polar-Radius_Invariant_Moments_and_Structure_Moment_Invariants","6858075_A_new_convexity_measure_based_on_a_probabilistic_interpretation_of_images","3193282_The_Trace_Transform_and_Its_Applications"]}
