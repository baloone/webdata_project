{"id":"337884768_Leader-Following_Consensus_and_Formation_Control_of_VTOL-UAVs_with_Event-Triggered_Communications","abstract":"This article presents the design and implementation of an event-triggered control approach, applied to the leader-following consensus and formation of a group of autonomous micro-aircraft with capabilities of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL-UAVs). The control strategy is based on an inner-outer loop control approach. The inner control law stabilizes the attitude and position of one agent, whereas the outer control follows a virtual leader to achieve position consensus cooperatively through an event-triggered policy. The communication topology uses undirected and connected graphs. With such an event-triggered control, the closed-loop trajectories converge to a compact sphere, centered in the origin of the error space. Furthermore, the minimal inter-sampling time is proven to be below bounded avoiding the Zeno behavior. The formation problem addresses the group of agents to fly in a given shape configuration. The simulation and experimental results highlight the performance of the proposed control strategy.","authors":["J. F.
