{"id":"226011044_Web_Usability_Principles_and_Evaluation_Methods","abstract":"Current Web applications are very complex and highly sophisticated software products, whose usability can greatly determine\ntheir success or failure. Defining methods for ensuring usability is one of the current goals of Web engineering research.\nAlso, much attention is currently paid to usability by industry, recognising the importance of adopting methods for usability\nevaluation before and after application deployment. This chapter introduces principles and evaluation methods to be adopted\nduring the whole application lifecycle for promoting usability. For each evaluation method, the main features, as well as\nthe emerging advantages and drawbacks, are illustrated so as to support the choice of an evaluation plan that best fits the\ngoals to be pursued and the available resources. The design and evaluation of a real application is also described for exemplifying\nthe concepts and methods introduced.","authors":["Maristella Matera","Francesca Rizzo","Giovanni Toffetti Carughi"],"meta":["March 2006","DOI:10.1007/3-540-28218-1_5","In book: Web Engineering (pp.143-180)"],"references":["307174918_Mining_association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","285843397_Mining_association_rules_between_set_of_items_in_largedatabases","270960171_Human_Information_Behavior","314814246_Cognitive_walkthrough_for_the_web","313606501_Mining_Association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","292060872_Cost-justifying_usability","285784327_A_mathematical_model_of_the_finding_of_usability_problems","274422601_Accessibility","262391872_The_diversity_of_usability_practices","262008071_Designing_Interaction_Psychology_at_the_Human-Computer_Interface"]}
