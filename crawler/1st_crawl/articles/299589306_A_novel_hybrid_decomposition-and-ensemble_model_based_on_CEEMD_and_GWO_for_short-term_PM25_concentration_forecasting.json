{"id":"299589306_A_novel_hybrid_decomposition-and-ensemble_model_based_on_CEEMD_and_GWO_for_short-term_PM25_concentration_forecasting","abstract":"To enhance prediction reliability and accuracy, a hybrid model based on the promising principle of “decomposition and ensemble” and a recently proposed meta-heuristic called grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is introduced for daily PM2.5 concentration forecasting. Compared with existing PM2.5 forecasting methods, this proposed model has improved the prediction accuracy and hit rates of directional prediction. The proposed model involves three main steps, i.e., decomposing the original PM2.5 series into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) via complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) for simplifying the complex data; individually predicting each IMF with support vector regression (SVR) optimized by GWO; integrating all predicted IMFs for the ensemble result as the final prediction by another SVR optimized by GWO. Seven benchmark models, including single artificial intelligence (AI) models, other decomposition-ensemble models with different decomposition methods and models with the same decomposition-ensemble method but optimized by different algorithms, are considered to verify the superiority of the proposed hybrid model. The empirical study indicates that the proposed hybrid decomposition-ensemble model is remarkably superior to all considered benchmark models for its higher prediction accuracy and hit rates of directional prediction.","authors":["Mingfei Niu","Yufang Wang","Shaolong Sun","Yunwu Li"],"meta":["April 2016Atmospheric Environment 134","DOI:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.056"],"references":["292208893_Construction_of_the_influenza_A_virus_transmission_tree_in_a_college-based_population_Co-transmission_and_interactions_between_influenza_A_viruses","279155670_Short-Term_Wind_Speed_Hybrid_Forecasting_Model_Based_on_Bias_Correcting_Study_and_Its_Application","272083289_The_Neuroprotective_Effect_of_Maltol_against_Oxidative_Stress_on_Rat_Retinal_Neuronal_Cells","260010809_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer","224810617_An_application_of_ARIMA_model_to_predict_submicron_particle_concentrations_from_meteorological_factors_at_a_busy_roadside_in_Hangzhou_China","220531136_Complementary_Ensemble_Empirical_Mode_Decomposition_a_Novel_Noise_Enhanced_Data_Analysis_Method","49793957_Intercomparison_of_air_quality_data_using_principal_component_analysis_and_forecasting_of_PM10_and_PM25_concentrations_using_artificial_neural_networks_in_Thessaloniki_and_Helsinki","7942583_Potential_assessment_of_the_support_vector_machine_method_in_forecasting_ambient_air_pollutant_trends","303014477_Short-Term_Wind_Speed_Hybrid_Forecasting_Model_Based_on_Bias_Correcting_Study_and_Its_Application_Math_Probl_Eng","282222901_A_decomposition-ensemble_model_with_data-characteristic-driven_reconstruction_for_crude_oil_price_forecasting","280836997_Binary_Grey_Wolf_Optimization_Approaches_for_Feature_Selection","280316639_Single_and_Multi-objective_Optimal_Power_Flow_Using_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer_and_Differential_Evolution_Algorithms","280154561_The_forecasting_research_of_early_warning_systems_for_atmospheric_pollutants_A_case_in_Yangtze_River_Delta_region","278392181_Techniques_of_applying_wavelet_de-noising_into_a_combined_model_for_short-term_load_forecasting","276248222_A_Novel_CEEMD-Based_EELM_Ensemble_Learning_Paradigm_for_Crude_Oil_Price_Forecasting","275100723_Using_the_gray_wolf_optimizer_for_solving_optimal_reactive_power_dispatch_problem","274569608_Multivariate_methods_for_indoor_PM10_and_PM25_modelling_in_naturally_ventilated_schools_buildings","272028097_A_soft_self-repairing_for_FBG_sensor_network_in_SHM_system_based_on_PSO-SVR_model_reconstruction","269175072_A_novel_hybrid_forecasting_model_for_PM10_and_SO2_daily_concentrations","266203801_Analysis_and_forecasting_of_the_particulate_matter_PM_concentration_levels_over_four_major_cities_of_China_using_hybrid_models","257522660_Ensemble_and_enhanced_PM10_concentration_forecast_model_based_on_stepwise_regression_and_wavelet_analysis","257522282_Prediction_of_ozone_levels_using_a_Hidden_Markov_Model_HMM_with_Gamma_distribution","254407598_A_novel_hybrid_ensemble_learning_paradigm_for_nuclear_energy_consumption_forecasting","233878271_PM10_emission_forecasting_using_artificial_neural_networks_and_genetic_algorithm_input_variable_optimization","232410740_PM10_forecasting_using_clusterwise_regression","232410680_Factors_influencing_the_variations_of_PM10_aerosol_dust_in_Klang_Valley_Malaysia_during_the_summer","225973299_Using_Seven_Types_of_GM_1_1_Model_to_Forecast_Hourly_Particulate_Matter_Concentration_in_Banciao_City_of_Taiwan","223702358_Combining_deterministic_and_statistical_approaches_for_PM10_forecasting_in_Europe","223376915_Forecasting_crude_oil_price_with_an_EMD-based_neural_network_ensemble_learning_paradigm","221823869_Forecasting_PM10_in_metropolitan_areas_Efficacy_of_neural_networks","220565082_Forecasting_concentrations_of_air_pollutants_by_logarithm_support_vector_regression_with_immune_algorithms","220096166_Application_of_a_SVM-based_regression_model_to_the_air_quality_study_at_local_scale_in_the_Aviles_urban_area_Spain","220026091_A_Hybrid_ARIMA_and_Artificial_Neural_Networks_Model_to_Forecast_Particulate_Matter_in_Urban_Areas_The_Case_of_Temuco_Chile","45283389_Forecasting_hourly_PM10_concentration_in_Cyprus_through_artificial_neural_networks_and_multiple_regression_models_Implications_to_local_environmental_management"]}
