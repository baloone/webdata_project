{"id":"233477003_A_simple_linear-time_algorithm_for_computing_the_center_of_an_interval_graph","abstract":"The computational problem of finding the center of a graph is motivated by a number of facility-location problems. We exploit a new characterization of interval graphs for the purpose of obtaining a linear-time algorithm for computing both the center and the diameter of an interval graph.","authors":["Stephan Olariu"],"meta":["January 1990International Journal of Computer Mathematics 34(3-4):121-128","DOI:10.1080/00207169008803870"],"references":["243779645_Computation_of_the_center_and_diameter_of_outerplanar_graphs","242932950_Minimax_Location_of_a_Facility_in_a_Network","242639730_Graph_Theory_and_Its_Applications_to_Problems_of_Society","230595955_A_Characterization_of_Comparability_Graphs_and_of_Interval_Graphs","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms"]}
