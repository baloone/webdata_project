{"id":"329417786_Audio_Augmentation_for_Traffic_Signs_A_Case_Study_of_Pakistani_Traffic_Signs","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) extend the appearance of real-world by adding digital information to the scene using computer graphics and image processing techniques. Various approaches have been used to detect, identify and track objects in real environment depending upon the application, shape of the tracking object and environment type. The marker-based tracking technique is the most commonly used method in augmented reality applications in which fiducial markers are put in the real-world for tracking. In this work we proposed a model to detect and identify the traffic signs through marker based technique to improve the usability of marker-based detection in augmented reality applications. We developed an AR application that can detect and recognize the markers designed for Pakistani traffic signs and augment them with voice alert to the driver so that he does prepared for the upcoming hurdle on the road. As identified by literature no work has been performed on augmentation of voice for traffic signs. From experiments the model outperforms than baseline techniques.
