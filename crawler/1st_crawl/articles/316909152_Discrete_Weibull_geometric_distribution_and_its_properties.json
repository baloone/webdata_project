{"id":"316909152_Discrete_Weibull_geometric_distribution_and_its_properties","abstract":"In this paper, the discrete analogue of Weibull geometric distribution is introduced. Discrete Weibull, discrete Rayleigh and geometric distributions are sub models of this distribution. Some basic distributional properties, hazard function, random number generation, moments and order statistics of this new discrete distribution are studied. Estimation of the parameters are done using maximum likelihood method. The applications of the distribution is established using two data sets.","authors":["Jayakumar Kuttan Pillai","Babu Girish Moolath"],"meta":["May 2017Communication in Statistics- Theory and Methods","DOI:10.1080/03610926.2017.1327074"],"references":["312369415_Note_on_the_generation_of_most_probable_frequency_distributions","296928216_New_defect_distribution_metrology_with_a_consistent_discrete_exponential_formula_and_its_applications","275408067_The_exponentiated_discrete_Weibull_distribution","268314106_The_Stress-Strength_Model_and_its_Generalizations","265824511_An_Introduction_to_Probability_and_Statistics","263759804_Discrete_Gamma_Distributions_Properties_and_Parameter_Estimations","256253666_A_New_Discrete_Probability_Distribution_with_Integer_Support_on_-","256252791_A_New_Discrete_Distribution_Related_to_Generalized_Gamma_Distribution_and_It's_Properties","243044574_The_Discrete_Normal_Distribution","240924157_Discrete_Burr_and_discrete_Pareto_distributions"]}
