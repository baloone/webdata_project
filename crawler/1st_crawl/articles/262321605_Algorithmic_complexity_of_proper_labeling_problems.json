{"id":"262321605_Algorithmic_complexity_of_proper_labeling_problems","abstract":"A proper labeling of a graph is an assignment of integers to some elements of a graph, which may be the vertices, the edges, or both of them, such that we obtain a proper vertex coloring via the labeling subject to some conditions. The problem of proper labeling offers many variants and received a great interest during recent years. We consider the algorithmic complexity of some variants of the proper labeling problems, we present some polynomial time algorithms and NP-completeness results for them.","authors":["Ali Dehghan","Mohammad-Reza Sadeghi","Arash Ahadi"],"meta":["July 2013Theoretical Computer Science 495:25-36","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2013.05.027"],"references":["264957055_Adjacent_Vertex_Distinguishing_Edge-Colorings","261101035_The_Complexity_of_the_Sigma_Chromatic_Number_of_Cubic_Graphs","239064875_The_Even_Cycle_Problem_for_Directed_Graphs","220342374_Digraphs_are_2-Weight_Choosable","220200458_Vertex-colouring_edge-weightings_with_two_edge_weights","220075635_Vertex-coloring_edge-weightings_Towards_the_1-2-3-conjecture","306283598_Gap_vertex-distinguishing_edge_colorings_of_graphs","262295959_Planar_NAE3SAT_is_in_P","258451312_Algorithmic_Number_Theory","257428713_Hard_Tiling_Problems_with_Simple_Tiles","257406767_On_the_Lucky_Choice_Number_of_Graphs","256720160_12_Conjecture-the_multiplicative_version","248321426_Vertex-Distinguishing_Proper_Edge-Colorings","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","242789994_Uniqueness_of_colorability_and_colorability_of_planar_4-regular_graphs_are_NP-complete","242530345_On_an_estimate_of_the_chromatic_class_of_a_p-graph_In_Russian","239061519_Algorithmic_Number_Theory_Volume_1","228834348_Gap_vertex-distinguishing_edge_colorings_of_graphs","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","222656920_D300_is_a_bound_on_the_adjacent_vertex_distinguishing_edge_chromatic_number","222153315_Lucky_labelings_of_graphs","221933085_Introduction_To_Graph_Theory","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220617300_The_NP-Completeness_of_Edge-Coloring","220570958_Degree_constrained_subgraphs","220548994_Weight_choosability_of_graphs","220397725_The_Sigma_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Graph","220200541_On_the_complexity_of_vertex-coloring_edge-weightings","220114169_Computation_of_lucky_number_of_planar_graphs_is_NP-hard","220111896_Multiplicative_vertex-colouring_weightings_of_graphs","220074779_Vertex_coloring_edge_partitions"]}
