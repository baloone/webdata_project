A total of 33 journals were grouped under Web of Science category of horticulture. Article has been cited more than 100 times being published since 1961 assessed in the terms of their distribution in the journals, and citation life cycle. Further, we have evaluated performance of authors, country and institutions. The Journal Theoretical and Applied Genetics and American Journal of Enology and Viticulture were more productive journals. Most of the highly cited articles published in 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Average authors per article also kept increasing from 1960s to 2000s, respectively. University of California, Davis and Cornell University in USA were the most productivity institutions and USA and the UK were the most contributing countries. The citation life cycles of the highly cited articles indicate that majority of the highly cited articles had received less citation in their publication decade, later started to receive good number of citations.","authors":["Shankar Reddy Kolle","Shankarappa Hanumaiah","Yuh-Shan Ho"],"meta":["June 2017Erwerbs-Obstbau 59(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10341-016-0308-4"],"references":["282003672_Computer_science_in_Eastern_Europe_1989-2014_A_bibliometric_study","311450999_A_high-density_microsatellite_consensus_map_for_bread_wheat_Triticum_aestivum_L","303800025_Highly_cited_Antarctic_articles_using_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded_a_bibliometric_analysis","303718402_Molecular_mapping_of_rice_chromosomes","296833765_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_highly_cited_articles_in_materials_science","293518380_Citation_Classics_in_Nursing_Journals_The_Top_50_Most_Frequently_Cited_Articles_from_1956-2011_vol_62_pg_344_2013","291311255_Reporting_of_Objective_Color_Measurements","288494609_Highly_cited_articles_in_the_Information_Science_and_Library_Science_category_in_Social_Science_Citation_Index_A_bibliometric_analysis","288199060_Higher_impact_factor_Better_journal_Not_a_necessity","278165300_A_Bibliometric_Study_of_Highly_Cited_Reviews_in_the_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded_TM","277327315_Total_Phenol_Analysis_Automation_and_Comparison_with_Manual_Methods","276414720_Highly_cited_articles_in_biomass_research_A_bibliometric_analysis","272288378_The_Order_of_Authorship_Who's_on_First","267456009_Bibliometric_profile_of_top-cited_single-author_articles_in_the_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded","266747025_Highly_Cited_Articles_in_Health_Care_Sciences_and_Services_Field_in_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_for_1958-2012"]}
