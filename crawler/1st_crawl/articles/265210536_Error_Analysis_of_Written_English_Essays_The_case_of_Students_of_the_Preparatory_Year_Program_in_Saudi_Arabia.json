{"id":"265210536_Error_Analysis_of_Written_English_Essays_The_case_of_Students_of_the_Preparatory_Year_Program_in_Saudi_Arabia","abstract":"The present study attempts to investigate the errors in a corpus of 32 essays written by 32Arabic-speaking Saudi learners of English. All the participants in the study are male students who graduated from Saudi secondary schools and joined the Preparatory Year Program at University of Ha'il. The instrument used for this study was participantsâ€™ written essays in English language. All of the errors in these essays were identified and classified into different categorizations. The results show that the Arabic speakers in this study committed ten common errors. These errors are: (1) verb tense, (2) word order, (3) singular/plural form, (4) subject-verb agreement, (5) double negatives, (6) spellings, (7) capitalization, (8) articles (9) sentence fragments and (10) prepositions. On the basis of these results, a group of recommendations to further research are suggested and some pedagogical implications which might assist ESL/EFL teachers with some helpful suggestions and teaching strategies that will reduce future problems regarding writing English essays among Arab learners.","authors":["Murad Sawalmeh"],"meta":["March 2013"],"references":["311854673_The_Effect_of_EFL_Learners'_Mother_Tongue_on_their_Writings_in_English_An_Error_Analysis_Study","297477522_Understanding_Social_Change","275262670_A_Non-Contrastive_Approach_to_Error_Analysis1","274815899_Linguistics_and_Language_Teaching","267448239_Errors_in_Language_Learning_and_Use_Exploring_Error_Analysis","261659120_A_Study_in_Language_Teaching","260321320_Error_Analysis_of_the_Written_English_Essays_of_Pakistani_Undergraduate_Students_A_Case_Study","249930610_The_Significance_of_Learner_Errors","247252022_Principles_of_Language_Learning_And_Teaching","240536010_Writing_Errors_A_Study_of_the_Writing_Ability_of_Arab_Learners_of_Academic_English_and_Arabic_at_University"]}
