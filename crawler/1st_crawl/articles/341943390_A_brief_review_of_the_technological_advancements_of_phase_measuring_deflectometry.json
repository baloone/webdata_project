{"id":"341943390_A_brief_review_of_the_technological_advancements_of_phase_measuring_deflectometry","abstract":"This paper presents a short review for phase measuring deflectometry (PMD). PMD is a phase calculation based technique for three-dimensional (3D) measurement of specular surfaces. PMD can achieve nano-scale form measurement accuracy with the advantages of high dynamic range, non-contact, full field measurement which makes it a competitive method for specular surface measurement. With the development of computer science, display and imaging technology, there has been an advancement in speed for PMD in recent years. This paper discusses PMD focusing on the difference on its system configuration. Measurement principles, progress, advantages and problems are discussed for each category. The challenges and future development of PMD are also discussed.","authors":["Yongjia Xu","Feng Gao","Xiang Qian Jiang"],"meta":["December 2020PhotoniX 1(1)","DOI:10.1186/s43074-020-00015-9"],"references":["335368001_Extra-detection-free_monoscopic_deflectometry_for_the_in_situ_measurement_of_freeform_specular_surfaces","331563327_Efficient_phase_retrieval_of_two-directional_phase-shifting_fringe_patterns_using_geometric_constraints_of_deflectometry","331394303_Self-calibration_of_in_situ_monoscopic_deflectometric_measurement_in_precision_optical_manufacturing","328932982_Near-null_interferometry_using_an_aspheric_null_lens_generating_a_broad_range_of_variable_spherical_aberration_for_flexible_test_of_aspheres","328720036_Performance_Analysis_and_Evaluation_of_Geometric_Parameters_in_Stereo_Deflectometry","326683085_Enhancement_of_measurement_accuracy_of_optical_stereo_deflectometry_based_on_imaging_model_analysis","335468336_Deflectometry_in_cylindrical_coordinates_using_a_conical_mirror_principles_and_proof_of_concept","331428019_Infinite_deflectometry_enabling_2p-steradian_measurement_range","329552379_Phase_measurement_deflectometry_with_refraction_model_and_its_calibration","326743924_Review_of_phase_measuring_deflectometry"]}
