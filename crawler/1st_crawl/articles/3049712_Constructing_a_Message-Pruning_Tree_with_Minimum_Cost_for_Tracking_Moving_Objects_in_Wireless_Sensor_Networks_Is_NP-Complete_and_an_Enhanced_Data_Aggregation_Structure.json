{"id":"3049712_Constructing_a_Message-Pruning_Tree_with_Minimum_Cost_for_Tracking_Moving_Objects_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Is_NP-Complete_and_an_Enhanced_Data_Aggregation_Structure","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks have often been used to monitor and report the locations of moving objects. Since sensors can also be used for storage, a wireless sensor network can be considered a distributed database, enabling us to update and query the location information of moving objects. Many researchers have studied the problem of how to construct message-pruning trees that can update a database and query objects with minimum cost (the Minimum-Cost Message-Pruning Tree problem). The trees are constructed in such a way that the total cost of updating the database and querying objects is kept as minimal as possible, while the hardness of the Minimum-Cost Message-Pruning Tree problem remains unknown. In this paper, we first show that the Minimum-Cost Message-Pruning Tree problem is NP-complete. Subsequently, since the message-pruning tree with minimum cost is hard to construct in polynomial time, we propose a new data aggregation structure, a message-pruning tree with shortcuts, instead of the message- pruning tree. Simulation results show that the proposed data aggregation structure significantly reduces the total cost of updating the database and querying objects as compared to the message-pruning tree.","authors":["Bing-Hong Liu","Wei-Chieh Ke","Chin-Hsien Tsai","Ming-Jer Tsai"],"meta":["July 2008IEEE Transactions on Computers 57(6):849-863","DOI:10.1109/TC.2008.22","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["313173590_A_new_approach_to_the_geometry_of_TOA_location","245976163_Dual_prediction-based_reporting_mechanism_for_object_trackign_sensor_networks","245092718_A_survey_of_a_fundamental_geometric_data_structure","242456502_Information-Driven_Dynamic_Sensor_Collaboration_for_Tracking_Applications","229964894_Two_energy_efficient_algorithms_for_tracking_objects_in_a_sensor_network","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220565961_Voronoi_Diagrams_-_A_Survey_of_Fundamental_Geometric_Data_Structure","31354655_Location_Tracking_in_a_Wireless_Sensor_Network_by_Mobile_Agents_and_Its_Data_Fusion_Strategies","4200086_A_scalable_framework_for_distributed_time_synchronization_in_multi-hop_sensor_networks"]}
