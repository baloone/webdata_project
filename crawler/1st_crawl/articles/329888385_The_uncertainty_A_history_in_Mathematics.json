{"id":"329888385_The_uncertainty_A_history_in_Mathematics","abstract":"Naturally every phenomenon consists possible has the same concept but has a different character: certainty and uncertainty. Therefore, in mathematics continuously developed several paradigms to understand it. This paper historically reveals the development of an understanding of uncertainty based on certainty, i.e. a framework for seeking the solution.","authors":["Mahyuddin K. M.
