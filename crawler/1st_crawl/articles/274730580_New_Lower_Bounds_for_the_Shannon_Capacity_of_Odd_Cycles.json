{"id":"274730580_New_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Shannon_Capacity_of_Odd_Cycles","abstract":"The Shannon capacity of a graph $G$ is defined as $c(G)=\\sup_{d\\geq\n1}(\\alpha(G^d))^{\\frac{1}{d}},$ where $\\alpha(G)$ is the independence number of\n$G$. The Shannon capacity of the cycle $C_5$ on $5$ vertices was determined by\nLov\\'{a}sz in 1979, but the Shannon capacity of a cycle $C_p$ for general odd\n$p$ remains one of the most notorious open problems in information theory. By\nprescribing stabilizers for the independent sets in $C_p^d$ and using\nstochastic search methods, we show that $\\alpha(C_7^5)\\geq 350$,\n$\\alpha(C_{11}^4)\\geq 748$, $\\alpha(C_{13}^4)\\geq 1534$ and\n$\\alpha(C_{15}^3)\\geq 381$. This leads to improved lower bounds on the Shannon\ncapacity of $C_7$ and $C_{15}$: $c(C_7)\\geq 350^{\\frac{1}{5}}> 3.2271$ and\n$c(C_{15})\\geq 381^{\\frac{1}{3}}> 7.2495$.","authors":["K.
