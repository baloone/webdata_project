{"id":"220817044_Multi-Perspective_Question_Answering_Using_the_OpQA_Corpus","abstract":"We investigate techniques to support the answering of opinion-based questions. We first present the OpQA corpus of opin- ion questions and answers. Using the cor- pus, we compare and contrast the proper- ties of fact and opinion questions and an- swers. Based on the disparate characteris- tics of opinion vs. fact answers, we argue that traditional fact-based QA approaches may have difficulty in an MPQA setting without modification. As an initial step towards the development of MPQA sys- tems, we investigate the use of machine learning and rule-based subjectivity and opinion source filters and show that they can be used to guide MPQA systems.","authors":["Veselin Stoyanov","Claire Cardie","Janyce Wiebe"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.3115/1220575.1220691","SourceDBLP","Conference: HLT/EMNLP 2005, Human Language Technology Conference and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference, 6-8 October 2005, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"],"references":["248832100_Thumbs_Up_or_Thumbs_Down_Semantic_Orientation_Applied_to_Unsupervised_Classification_of_Reviews","221629307_Creating_Subjective_and_Objective_Sentence_Classifiers_from_Unannotated_Texts","221037779_LCC_Tools_for_Question_Answering","221037697_Overview_of_the_TREC-9_Question_Answering_Track","221037423_Overview_of_the_TREC_2004_Question_Answering_Track","245973766_DRAFT_Overview_of_the_TREC_2003_Question_Answering_Track","243134278_A_Sentimental_Education_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Subjectivity_Summarization_Based_on_Minimum_Cuts","239557337_Yahoo_for_Amazon_extracting_market_sentiment_from_stock_message_boards","221605964_Automatically_Generating_Extraction_Patterns_from_Untagged_Text","215470804_Towards_answering_opinion_questions_Separating_facts_from_opinions_and_identifying_the_polarity_of_opinion_sentences"]}
