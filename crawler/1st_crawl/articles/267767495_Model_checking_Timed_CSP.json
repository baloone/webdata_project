{"id":"267767495_Model_checking_Timed_CSP","abstract":"Though Timed CSP was developed 25 years ago and the CSP-based refinement checker FDR [25] was first released 20 years ago, there has never been a version of this tool for Timed CSP. In this paper we report on the creation of such a version, based on the digitisation results of Ouaknine [16, 17] and the associated development of discrete-time versions of Timed CSP with associated models [19, 14, 11, 27].","authors":["Philip Armstrong","Gavin Lowe","JoÃ«l Ouaknine","A.
