{"id":"222399548_Educational_game_design_for_online_education","abstract":"The use of educational games in learning environments is an increasingly relevant trend. The motivational and immersive traits of game-based learning have been deeply studied in the literature, but the systematic design and implementation of educational games remain an elusive topic. In this study some relevant requirements for the design of educational games in online education are analyzed, and a general game design method that includes adaptation and assessment features is proposed. Finally, a particular implementation of that design is described in light of its applicability to other implementations and environments.","authors":["Pablo Moreno Ger","Daniel Burgos","Ivan Martinez-Ortiz","Jos√© Luis Sierra"],"meta":["September 2008Computers in Human Behavior 24(6):2530-2540","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2008.03.012","SourceDBLP"],"references":["314457320_Building_Artificially_Intelligent_Learning_Games","279708017_Building_Artificially_Intelligent_Learning_Games","314520048_Building_Artificially_Intelligent_Learning_Games","313168128_Building_an_educational_adventure_game_Theory_design_and_lessons","303183396_Game-based_learning_An_x-learn_perspective_paper","292770369_Literature_review_in_games_and_learning","291982970_Identifying_predictors_of_academic_persistence_in_distance_education","289669224_Personal_computer_adventure_games","276935128_IMS_learning_design_specification_Version_10_final_specification","271787795_Digital_Game-Based_Learning"]}
