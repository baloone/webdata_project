{"id":"289587267_Self-testing_through_EPR-steering","abstract":"The verification of quantum devices is an important aspect of quantum\ninformation, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental\nimplementations of computation and secure communication. Within this, the\ntheory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a\nlevel of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified\nwithout direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is\nsolely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of\nverification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In\nthis paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct\naccess to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing\nvia EPR steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between\nfull state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies EPR\nsteering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what\nadvantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do\npartial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally\nentangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR steering allows for simpler analysis\nand better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the\nother hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to\nconstants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main\nadvantage in self-testing based on EPR steering could be in the case of\nself-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may\nbe easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's\nHilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum\nsystem.","authors":["Ivan Supic","Matty J.
