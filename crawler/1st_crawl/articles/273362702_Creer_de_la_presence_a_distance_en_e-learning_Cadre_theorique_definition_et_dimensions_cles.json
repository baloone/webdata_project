{"id":"273362702_Creer_de_la_presence_a_distance_en_e-learning_Cadre_theorique_definition_et_dimensions_cles","abstract":"The article presents the synthesis of a work that we conducted to develop a model for the presence in e-learning. This work aims at a new theoretical perspective to the notion of presence. Indeed, it differs with the English speaking North American model of Community of Inquiry in e-learning. However, these two perspectives have in common to be based on the principle that presence is created by certain forms of social interactions between students, between teacher and learners when they are engaged in a distance collaborative approach. First, the article suggests a definition of the presence in e-learning while specifying the essential theoretical and epistemological positions that helped us to construct this definition. Then it explains the three dimensions that we attribute to the presence: i.e. the cognitive presence, the socio-emotional presence and the pedagogical presence. It defines each of those dimensions and shows their articulation. Finally, the article concludes on the limitations but also on the openings of this work to develop a model for presence in e-learning.","authors":["Annie Jézégou"],"meta":["June 2010Distances et Savoirs 8(2):257-274","DOI:10.3166/ds.8.257-274"],"references":[]}
