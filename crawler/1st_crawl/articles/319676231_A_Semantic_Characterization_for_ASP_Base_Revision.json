{"id":"319676231_A_Semantic_Characterization_for_ASP_Base_Revision","abstract":"The paper deals with base revision for Answer Set Programming (ASP). Base revision in classical logic is done by the removal of formulas. Exploiting the non-monotonicity of ASP allows one to propose other revision strategies, namely addition strategy or removal and/or addition strategy. These strategies allow one to define families of rule-based revision operators. The paper presents a semantic characterization of these families of revision operators in terms of answer sets. This characterization allows one to equivalently consider the evolution of syntactic logic programs and the evolution of their semantic content.","authors":["Laurent Garcia","Claire Lefèvre","Odile Papini","Igor Stéphan"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-67582-4_24","Conference: International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management"],"references":["314183726_Reconsidering_AGM-Style_Belief_Revision_in_the_Context_of_Logic_Programs","301879263_A_New_Approach_for_Revising_Logic_Programs","259224048_A_Model-Theoretic_Approach_to_Belief_Change_in_Answer_Set_Programming","234831120_The_DLV_System_for_Knowledge_Representation_and_Reasoning","221393429_Belief_Revision_of_Logic_Programs_under_Answer_Set_Semantics","221306739_Updating_Extended_Logic_Programs_through_Abduction","220838551_On_Semantic_Update_Operators_for_Answer-Set_Programs","220814251_Inconsistency_Management_and_Prioritized_Syntax-Based_Entailment","220643674_On_Properties_of_Update_Sequences_Based_on_Causal_Rejection","220642800_Logic_Programs_with_Stable_Model_Semantics_as_a_Constraint_Programming_Paradigm","44190746_Merging_Logic_Programs_under_Answer_Set_Semantics","2559777_Strong_Equivalence_Made_Easy_Nested_Expressions_and_Weight_Constraints","2408055_The_Stable_Model_Semantics_For_Logic_Programming","268722626_Reasoning_and_Declarative_Problem_Solving","267092758_Extending_belief_base_change_to_logic_programs_with_ASP","267003595_Belief_Base_Change_Operations_for_Answer_Set_Programming","266267815_Semi-Revision","256660314_Conflict-driven_answer_set_solving_From_theory_to_practice","238951554_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Semantic_Rule_Updates_Based_on_SE-Models","226121349_On_the_Logic_of_Theory_Change_Safe_Contraction","225141914_Merging_Belief_Bases_Represented_by_Logic_Programs","225123106_An_Answer_Set_Programming_Encoding_of_Prioritized_Removed_Sets_Revision_Application_to_GIS","222232245_Propositional_knowledge_base_revision_and_minimal_change","221393601_Revision_an_application_in_the_framework_of_GIS","220986688_Here's_the_Beef_Answer_Set_Programming","220837858_Removed_Sets_Fusion_Performing_Off_The_Shelf","220836816_A_Complete_Revision_Function_in_Propositional_Calculus","220814167_Belief_Revision_Revised","220547100_A_Logic_for_Default_Reasoning","220118332_Dynamic_updates_of_non-monotonic_knowledge_bases","2823345_Updating_Logic_Programs"]}
