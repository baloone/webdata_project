{"id":"222410003_The_PROMPT_suite_Interactive_tools_for_ontology_merging_and_mapping","abstract":"Researchers in the ontology-design field have developed the content for ontologies in many domain areas. This distributed nature of ontology development has led to a large number of ontologies covering overlapping domains. In order for these ontologies to be reused, they first need to be merged or aligned to one another. We developed a suite of tools for managing multiple ontologies. These suite provides users with a uniform framework for comparing, aligning, and merging ontologies, maintaining versions, translating between different formalisms. Two of the tools in the suite support semi-automatic ontology merging: iPrompt is an interactive ontology-merging tool that guides the user through the merging process, presenting him with suggestions for next steps and identifying inconsistencies and potential problems. AnchorPrompt uses a graph structure of ontologies to find correlation between concepts and to provide additional information for iPrompt.","authors":["Natasha Noy","Mark Alan Musen"],"meta":["October 2003International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 59(6):983-1024","DOI:10.1016/j.ijhcs.2003.08.002"],"references":["245250231_Algorithm_and_Tool_for_Automated_Ontology_Merging_and_Alignment","242623376_Anchor-PROMPT_Using_NonLocal_Context_for_Semantic_Matching","228796674_Combining_and_standardizing_large-scale_practical_ontologies_for_machine_translation_and_other_uses","228456051_A_Method-Description_Lanuage_An_initial_ontology_with_examples","227221825_OBSERVER_An_Approach_for_Query_Processing_in_Global_Information_Systems_Based_on_Interoperation_Across_Pre-Existing_Ontologies","226010262_Ontology_Translation_by_Ontology_Merging_and_Automated_Reasoning","221630900_OIL_in_a_Nutshell","221606754_PROMPT_Algorithm_and_Tool_for_Automated_Ontology_Merging_and_Alignment","221604061_PROMPTDIFF_A_Fixed-Point_Algorithm_for_Comparing_Ontology_Versions","221393548_An_Environment_for_Merging_and_Testing_Large_Ontologies","221309638_Schema_Mapping_as_Query_Discovery","220813201_UPML_A_Framework_for_Knowledge_System_Reuse","220473763_A_Survey_of_Approaches_to_Automatic_Schema_Matching","33943282_Trial_banks_an_informatics_foundation_for_evidence-based_medicine","21759235_Dimensions_of_knowledge_sharing_and_reuse","13360574_The_digital_anatomist_foundational_model_Principles_for_defining_and_structuring_its_concept_domain","3764770_Information_integration_Conceptual_modeling_and_reasoning_support","3670082_OBSERVER_An_Approach_for_Query_Processing_in_Global_Information_Systems_Based_on_Interoperation_Across_Pre-Existing_Ontologies","2865755_Representing_and_Reasoning_about_Mappings_between_Domain_Models","2625792_OntoMorph_A_Translation_System_for_Symbolic_Knowledge","2522973_PROMPTDIFF_A_fixed-point_algorithm_for_comparing_ontology_versions","2475502_FCA-Merge_Bottom-up_merging_of_ontologies","2405357_A_Vision_for_Management_of_Complex_Models","314794886_Learning_to_map_between_ontologies_on_the_semantic_web","313165439_A_unified_graph-based_framework_for_deriving_nominal_interscheme_properties_type_conflicts_and_object_cluster_similarities","279347205_Formal_Concept_Analysis","262404811_Reconciling_schemas_of_disparate_data_sources_A_machine-learning_approach","243775016_The_design-a-trial_project_Developing_a_knowledge-based_tool_for_authoring_clinical_trial_protocols","243775014_Web_ontology_language_OWL_reference_version_1","243772450_Model_management_Managing_complex_information_structures","243537677_DARPA_agent_markup_language","238651027_A_Collaborative_Tool_for_Ontology_Construction","230854795_WordNet_-_An_Electronical_Lexical_Database","228057957_Resource_Description_Framework_RDF","226925060_Description_Logics_for_Conceptual_Data_Modeling","222433796_Pushing_the_Envelope_Challenges_in_a_Frame-Based_Representation_of_Human_Anatomy","221995866_WordNet_An_Electronic_Lexical_Database","221549364_A_Unified_Graph-Based_Framework_for_Deriving_Nominal_Interscheme_Properties_Type_Conflicts_and_Object_Cluster_Similarities","221113179_The_icom_tool_for_Intelligent_Conceptual_Modeling","221024767_Description_Logics_for_Conceptual_Data_Modeling","220957376_Ontology_of_Integration_and_Integration_of_Ontologies","200045862_Wille_R_Formal_Concept_Analysis_Mathematical_Foundations_Springer_Berlin","25911236_The_Unified_Medical_Language_System","14786132_The_United_Medical_Language_System","3296943_Global_viewing_of_heterogeneous_data_sources","2854075_A_Scalable_Framework_for_the_Interoperation_of_Information_Sources","2839340_Learning_to_Map_between_Ontologies_on_the_Semantic_Web","2738575_Resource_Description_Framework_RDF_Model_and_Syntax","2626138_Toward_Principles_for_the_Design_of_Ontologies_Used_for_Knowledge_Sharing","2394748_Ontology_of_Integration_and_Integration_of_Ontologies","2363683_Generic_Schema_Matching_with_Cupid","2333835_OKBC_A_Programmatic_Foundation_for_Knowledge_Base_Interoperability","2333743_CYC_A_Large-Scale_Investment_in_Knowledge_Infrastructure","2305149_Object-Oriented_First-Order_Logic","2373257_DAMLOIL_is_not_Enough"]}
