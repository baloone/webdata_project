{"id":"336817733_Peer_Support_and_STEM_Success_for_One_African_American_Female_Engineer","abstract":"This research used counter-storytelling, a critical race theory methodology, to chronicle the lived experiences of one African American female PhD engineer as she recounted her undergraduate, master's, and doctoral STEM experiences at three postsecondary institutions. Using interviews and narrative to capture her first-hand perspective as a woman engineer of color, peer support was revealed as a dominant factor in her attainment of a PhD in engineering. The two counter-stories presented are related to positive and negative peer support in STEM. These narratives serve as valid evidence for one woman's experiences in STEM and emphasize the role of race and racism on peer networks and STEM success. Though showing this one case, the findings have implications for how higher education institutions can provide structures where supportive peer networks can emerge to support women of color and students of color in STEM.","authors":["Watkins","Mensah"],"meta":["April 2019The Journal of Negro Education 88(2):181","DOI:10.7709/jnegroeducation.88.2.0181"],"references":[]}
