{"id":"314139647_Heading_toward_Artificial_Intelligence_20","abstract":"With the popularization of the Internet, permeation of sensor networks, emergence of big data, increase in size of the information community, and interlinking and fusion of data and information throughout human society, physical space, and cyberspace, the information environment related to the current development of artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly changed. AI faces important adjustments, and scientific foundations are confronted with new breakthroughs, as AI enters a new stage: AI 2.0. This paper briefly reviews the 60-year developmental history of AI, analyzes the external environment promoting the formation of AI 2.0 along with changes in goals, and describes both the beginning of the technology and the core idea behind AI 2.0 development. Furthermore, based on combined social demands and the information environment that exists in relation to Chinese development, suggestions on the development of AI 2.0 are given.","authors":["Yunhe Pan"],"meta":["December 2016Engineering 2(4):409-413","DOI:10.1016/J.ENG.2016.04.018"],"references":["292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","288903608_The_power_of_crowds_Combining_humans_and_machines_can_help_tackle_increasingly_hard_problems","273005574_Describing_Videos_by_Exploiting_Temporal_Structure","233820788_AI_The_Tumultuous_History_of_the_Search_for_Artificial_Intelligence","221466796_DBpedia_A_Nucleus_for_a_Web_of_Open_Data","42635384_2020_Visions","306023887_Margaret_McCartney_Game_on_for_Pokemon_Go","266513714_Theory_and_Applications_of_Ontology_Computer_Applications","260809605_The_Parable_of_Google_Flu_Traps_in_Big_Data_Analysis","221213308_Freebase_A_collaboratively_created_graph_database_for_structuring_human_knowledge"]}
