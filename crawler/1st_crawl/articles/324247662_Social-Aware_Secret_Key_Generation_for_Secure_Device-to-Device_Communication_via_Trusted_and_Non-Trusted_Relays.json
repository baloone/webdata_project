{"id":"324247662_Social-Aware_Secret_Key_Generation_for_Secure_Device-to-Device_Communication_via_Trusted_and_Non-Trusted_Relays","abstract":"Physical layer security (PLS) is a promising technology\nin device-to-device (D2D) communications by exploiting\nreciprocity and randomness of wireless channels, which attracts\nconsiderable research attention in the D2D communications\ncommunity. In this paper, we investigated PLS for secure key\ngeneration rate (SKGR) in D2D communications based on cooperative\ntrusted and non-trusted relays. By leveraging social ties,\nwe exploit three social phenomena for secure communications,\ni.e., trusted scenario (social trust), non-trusted scenario (social\nreciprocity) and partially trusted scenario (mixed social trust\nand social reciprocity). The coalition game theory is further\nutilized to select the optimal relay pairs for improving SKGR.\nOn the basis of social ties, we develop an algorithm for SKGR\nthat protects the keys secret from both eavesdropper and nontrusted\nselected relays. We incorporate secure relays selection\nand system wide security for D2D communications. The stability\nand convergence of the proposed algorithm are also proved\nin our work. Both numerically and analytically results verify\neffectiveness and consistency of our proposed scheme, which\nensures better SKGR performance in D2D communications.","authors":["Muhammad Waqas","Manzoor Ahmed","Yong Li","Depeng Jin"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TWC.2018.2817607","Project: Social-Aware D2D Networks"],"references":["310824849_Physical_Layer_Security_for_Next_Generation_Wireless_Networks_Theories_Technologies_and_Challenges","292205529_Key_Generation_From_Wireless_Channels_A_Review","273398187_Social_Network_Aware_Device-to-Device_Communication_in_Wireless_Networks","269298515_SoCast_Social_ties_based_cooperative_video_multicast","262984545_Imitation-Based_Social_Spectrum_Sharing","260299827_Exploiting_Channel_Diversity_in_Secret_Key_Generation_From_Multipath_Fading_Randomness","257299276_A_Survey_on_Device-to-Device_Communication_in_Cellular_Networks","254063221_Design_aspects_of_network_assisted_Device-to-Device_communications","254061548_Operator_controlled_Device-to-Device_communications_in_LTE-Advanced_networks","224586614_Coalitional_Game_Theory_for_Communication_Networks","221609037_Robust_key_generation_from_signal_envelopes_in_wireless_networks","49908138_Adaptive_Channel_Recommendation_For_Opportunistic_Spectrum_Access","12354857_Strong_Reciprocity_and_Human_Sociality","3434621_Using_the_Physical_Layer_for_Wireless_Authentication_in_Time-Variant_Channels","3078265_Common_randomness_in_information_theory_and_cryptography_I_Secret_sharing","322947997_Mobility_Assisted_Content_Transmission_For_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","320906894_On_the_effectiveness_of_secret_key_extraction_from_wireless_signal_strength_in_real_environments","317426725_Mobility-Assisted_Device_to_Device_Communications_For_Content_Transmission","312169319_Security_and_Privacy_in_Device-to-Device_D2D_Communication_A_Review","308806942_Security_in_D2D_Communications_A_Review","305674600_Analysis_of_Key_Generation_Rate_from_Wireless_Channel_in_In-Band_Full-Duplex_Communications","290522779_PHY-Layer_Authentication_Using_Duobinary_Signaling_for_Spectrum_Enforcement","290509221_Simultaneously_Generating_Secret_and_Private_Keys_in_a_Cooperative_Pairwise_Independent_Network","283092234_Physical-Layer_Secret_Key_Generation_with_Colluding_Untrusted_Relays","281896508_Secret_Key_Generation_Rate_with_Power_Allocation_in_Relay-based_LTE-A_Networks","273192003_Device-to-device_communication_underlaying_converged_heterogeneous_networks","269328153_Efficient_resource_allocation_for_mobile_social_networks_in_D2D_communication_underlaying_cellular_networks","269298174_SYNERGY_A_game-theoretical_approach_for_cooperative_key_generation_in_wireless_networks","266447123_Exclusive_OR_XOR_and_hardware_random_number_generators","263813382_Coalitional_Games_for_Resource_Allocation_in_the_Device-to-Device_Uplink_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","263285605_Social-Aware_D2D_Communications_Qualitative_Insights_and_Quantitative_Analysis","262311814_Social_trust_and_social_reciprocity_based_cooperative_D2D_communications","260580607_From_Technological_Networks_to_Social_Networks","252062023_Secret_key_generation_exploiting_channel_characteristics_in_wireless_communications","242589487_The_Wire-tap_Channel","228572577_Cooperative_Key_Generation_in_Wireless_Networks","224154455_Mode_Selection_for_Device-To-Device_Communication_Underlaying_an_LTE-Advanced_Network","220099308_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_Cellular_Communications_Systems","51935196_Cooperative_Secret_Key_Generation_from_Phase_Estimation_in_NarrowbandFading_Channels","13771413_Communication_theory_of_secrecy_systems_1945","11487860_Random_Graph_Models_of_Social_Networks","3086850_Wireless_Information-Theoretic_Security"]}
