{"id":"257514780_Modelling_defeasible_and_prioritized_support_in_bipolar_argumentation","abstract":"Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex introduce bipolar argumentation frameworks by introducing a second relation on the arguments for representing the support among them. The main drawback of their approach is that they cannot encode defeasible support, for instance they cannot model an attack towards a support relation. In this paper, we introduce a way to model defeasible support in bipolar argumentation frameworks. We use the methodology of meta-argumentation in which Dung’s theory is used to reason about itself. Dung’s well-known admissibility semantics can be used on this meta-argumentation framework to compute the acceptable arguments, and all properties of Dung’s classical theory are preserved. Moreover, we show how different contexts can lead to the alternative strengthening of the support relation over the attack relation, and converse. Finally, we present two applications of our methodology for modeling support, the case of arguments provided with an internal structure and the case of abstract dialectical frameworks.","authors":["Serena Villata","Guido Boella","Dov Gabbay","Leon van der Torre"],"meta":["December 2012Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence 66(1-4)","DOI:10.1007/s10472-012-9317-7"],"references":["281984131_Bipolarity_in_argumentation_graphs_Towards_a_better_understanding","221650961_Support_in_Abstract_Argumentation","221650934_Integrating_Object_and_Meta-Level_Value_Based_Argumentation","221524312_Social_Viewpoints_for_Arguing_about_Coalitions","221350037_Temporal_Dynamics_of_Support_and_Attack_Networks_From_Argumentation_to_Zoology","221156559_On_the_Acceptability_of_Meta-arguments","220907938_Encompassing_Attacks_to_Attacks_in_Abstract_Argumentation_Frameworks","220907701_On_the_Acceptability_of_Arguments_in_Bipolar_Argumentation_Frameworks","220907421_Arguing_about_the_Trustworthiness_of_the_Information_Sources","220859563_Bipolarity_in_argumentation_graphs_Towards_a_better_understanding","220388083_Metalevel_argumentation","220349930_Analyzing_Cooperation_in_Iterative_Social_Network_Design","220298067_Meta-Argumentation_Modelling_I_Methodology_and_Techniques","49466088_Moving_Between_Argumentation_Frameworks","313760270_Support_in_abstract_argumentation","269690223_Network_modalities","254219528_Temporal_numerical_and_meta-level_dynamics_in_argumentation_networks","248056274_The_Uses_of_Argument","227732875_On_bipolarity_in_argumentation_frameworks","225070316_The_Uses_of_Argument","222464284_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_logic_programming_and_n-person_games_1","221651002_Translating_Wigmore_Diagrams","221539009_A_Logical_Framework_for_Modelling_Legal_Argument","221393317_Abstract_Dialectical_Frameworks","221002284_Consolidating_multiple_requirement_specifications_through_argumentation","220907563_An_Abstract_Theory_of_Argumentation_That_Accommodates_Defeasible_Reasoning_About_Preferences","220298345_Fibring_Argumentation_Frames","220297532_Semantics_for_Higher_Level_Attacks_in_Extended_Argumentation_Frames_Part_1_Overview","220063495_Coalitions_of_arguments_A_tool_for_handling_bipolar_argumentation_frameworks","48322293_An_abstract_framework_for_argumentation_with_structured_arguments","2516146_Rational_cognition_in_OSCAR"]}
