{"id":"262244906_Presburger_Vector_Addition_Systems","abstract":"The reach ability problem for Vector Addition Systems (VAS) is a central problem of net theory. The problem is known to be decidable by inductive invariants definable in the Presburger arithmetic. When the reach ability set is definable in the Presburger arithmetic, the existence of such an inductive invariant is immediate. However, in this case, the computation of a Presburger formula denoting the reach ability set is an open problem. In this paper we close this problem by proving that if the reach ability set of a VAS is definable in the Presburger arithmetic, then the VAS is flatable, i.e. its reach ability set can be obtained by runs labeled by words in a bounded language. As a direct consequence, classical algorithms based on acceleration techniques effectively compute a formula in the Presburger arithmetic denoting the reach ability set.","authors":["Jerome Leroux"],"meta":["June 2013Proceedings - Symposium on Logic in Computer Science","DOI:10.1109/LICS.2013.7","Conference: Proceedings of the 2013 28th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science"],"references":["224251030_Ackermannian_and_Primitive-Recursive_Bounds_with_Dickson's_Lemma","221583797_How_to_Compose_Presburger-Accelerations_Applications_to_Broadcast_Protocols","220287072_Decidability_Issues_for_Petri_Nets_-_a_survey","2406693_Petri_Nets_Flat_Languages_and_Linear_Arithmetic","268501754_Parallel_program_schemata","267804545_Vector_Addition_Systems_Reachability_Problem_A_Simpler_Solution","256555232_A_structure_to_decide_reachability_in_Petri_nets","243053136_Bounded_Regular_Sets","228057867_Theory_of_Linear_and_Integer_Programming","222850848_Parallel_program_schemata","221591746_An_Algorithm_for_the_General_Petri_Net_Reachability_Problem","221591022_Decidability_of_Reachability_in_Vector_Addition_Systems_Preliminary_Version","221590481_The_Decidability_of_the_Reachability_Problem_for_Vector_Addition_Systems_Preliminary_Version","221443134_The_General_Vector_Addition_System_Reachability_Problem_by_Presburger_Inductive_Invariants","220836171_Vector_Addition_System_Reachability_Problem_A_Short_Self-Contained_Proof","220618011_An_Algorithm_for_the_General_Petri_Net_Reachability_Problem","220430782_The_Complexity_of_the_Finite_Containment_Problem_for_Petri_Nets","220152940_Decidability_of_a_Temporal_Logic_Problem_for_Petri_Nets","220151637_On_the_Reachability_Problem_for_5-Dimensional_Vector_Addition_Systems","38346841_Semigroups_Presburger_formulas_and_languages","29614517_Flat_Counter_Automata_Almost_Everywhere","29598740_The_General_Vector_Addition_System_Reachability_Problem_by_Presburger_Inductive_Invariants"]}
