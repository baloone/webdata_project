{"id":"26845114_Challenges_for_Database_Management_in_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"This article discusses the challenges for Database Management in the Internet of Things. We provide -scenarios to illustrate the new world that will be produced by the Internet of Things, where physical objects are fully integrated into the information highway. We discuss the different types of data that will be part of the Internet of Things. These include identification, positional, environmental, historical, and descriptive data. We consider the challenges brought by the need to manage vast quantities of data across heterogeneous systems. In particular, we consider the areas of querying, indexing, process modeling, transaction handling, and integration of heterogeneous systems. We refer to the earlier work that might provide solutions for these challenges. Finally we discuss a road map for the Internet of Things and respective technical priorities.","authors":["Joshua Cooper","Anne E.
