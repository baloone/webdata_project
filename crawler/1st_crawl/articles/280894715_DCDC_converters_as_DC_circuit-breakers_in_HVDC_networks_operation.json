{"id":"280894715_DCDC_converters_as_DC_circuit-breakers_in_HVDC_networks_operation","abstract":"This paper presents the modeling and control of a DC/DC bidirectional converter suitable for medium voltage and power applications in Multi-Terminals HVDC (MT-HVDC) grids. Moreover its use as DC circuit-breaker is described. This is a new concept, against the contemporary studies of DC breakers,which could help for the implementation of MT-HVDC networks. The proposed multilevel topology is based on Dual Active Bridge (DAB). The overall control of the DC/DC converter is achieved by using a nonlinear control based in Lyapunov theory.","authors":["Miguel Jim√©nez Carrizosa","Julien Cortes","Abdelkrim Benchaib","Pedro Alou"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1109/EPE.2014.6910762","Project: Control and dispatch of MTDC grids"],"references":["256636931_DC_transformer_for_DCDC_connection_in_HVDC_network","303459727_Power_system_stability_benefits_with_VSC_DC-transmission_systems","294233903_Ultra_high_voltage_transmission","288569190_Flexible_Power_Transmission_The_HVDC_Options","261500004_Availability_evaluation_of_Multi-Terminal_DC_networks_with_DC_circuit_breakers","255596318_Solid-State_Transformer_based_on_SiC_JFETs_for_Future_Energy_Distribution_Systems","235057542_Nonlinear_Control_Systems","228108311_Nonlinear_Control_Systems_II","224368993_5kV200ns_Pulsed_Power_Switch_based_on_a_SiC-JFET_Super_Cascode","224286391_Progress_in_Silicon_Carbide_Power_Devices"]}
