{"id":"322838668_New_Incremental_Learning_Algorithm_With_Support_Vector_Machines","abstract":"Incremental learning is one of the most effective methods of learning accumulated data and large-scale data. The newly increased samples of the previously known works on incremental learning are usually independent and identically distributed. To study how dependent sampling methods influence the learning ability of incremental support vector machines (ISVM) algorithm, in this paper we introduce an ISVM based on Markov resampling (MR-ISVM), and give the experimental research on the learning ability of the MR-ISVM algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the MR-ISVM algorithm has not only smaller misclassification rates and sparser of the obtained classifiers, but also less total time of sampling and training compared to ISVM based on randomly independent sampling. We also compare it with other ISVM algorithms.","authors":["Jie Xu","Chen Xu","Bin Zou","Yuan Yan Tang"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems PP(99):1-12","DOI:10.1109/TSMC.2018.2791511"],"references":["246618463_An_Outpost_Vector_Placement_Evaluation_of_an_Incremental_Learning_Algorithm_for_Support_Vector_Machine","226139556_Fast_Rates_for_Support_Vector_Machines","221620390_Fast_Learning_from_Non-iid_Observations","220391260_Regularization_Networks_and_Support_Vector_Machines","220320507_Support_Vector_Machine_Soft_Margin_Classifiers_Error_Analysis","38351318_Concentration_of_measure_inequalities_for_Markov_chains_and_PH-mixing_processes","3086115_Online_Regularized_Classification_Algorithms","3084762_Capacity_of_reproducing_kernel_spaces_in_learning_theory","319469523_The_generalization_ability_of_online_SVM_classification_based_on_Markov_sampling","315385051_Learning_and_Generalisation","312532410_Incremental_and_decremental_support_vector_machine_learning","282187825_A_Fast_Incremental_Learning_Algorithm_Based_on_Twin_Support_Vector_Machine","279421890_Support_Vector_Machines","263867249_ONLINE_LEARNING_WITH_MARKOV_SAMPLING","260353900_Generalization_Performance_of_Fisher_Linear_Discriminant_Based_on_Markov_Sampling","260218406_Generalization_performance_of_Gaussian_kernels_SVMC_based_on_Markov_sampling","230663954_Weak_Convergence_and_Empirical_Process","228873092_On_the_Mathematical_Foundations_of_Learning","227236459_The_learning_performance_of_support_vector_machine_classification_based_on_Markov_sampling","225177173_The_generalization_performance_of_ERM_algorithm_with_strongly_mixing_observations","221995160_Theory_of_reproducing_kernels","220205112_The_incremental_learning_algorithm_with_support_vector_machine_based_on_hyperplane-distance","23644399_Learning_from_dependent_observations","3940269_Incremental_learning_with_support_vector_machines","3085277_Consistency_of_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Other_Regularized_Kernel_Classifiers","2560520_Statistical_Behavior_and_Consistency_of_Classification_Methods_based_on_Convex_Risk_Minimization","2313408_Incremental_Learning_with_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
