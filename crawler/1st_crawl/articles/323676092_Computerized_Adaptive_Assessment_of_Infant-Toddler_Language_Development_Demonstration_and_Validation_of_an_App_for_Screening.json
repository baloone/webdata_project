{"id":"323676092_Computerized_Adaptive_Assessment_of_Infant-Toddler_Language_Development_Demonstration_and_Validation_of_an_App_for_Screening","abstract":"We have developed a computerized adaptive test (an app), based on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI), that can rapidly gauge infant and toddler language development based on parent report. The app can be very useful in screening for developmental disabilities in IDEA Part C or Section 619. We will demonstrate the app and present validation data for toddlers.","authors":["Alan B.
