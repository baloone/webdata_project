Its praxis can be greatly strengthened if the investigations carried out in the area have repercussions on teaching in a perspective that is in tune with the notion that the teacher must, necessarily, be a researcher. This article seeks to highlight this association by analyzing the experiences of several students and colleagues who crossed paths with the researcher Adriana Bogliolo Sirihal Duarte, a professor at the School of Information Science of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Moreover, it intends to point out the path of this teacher, initially formed in Computer Science, which was punctuated not only by relevant contribution to the area, but by an educational practice performed with affection, joy, scientific ability, and technical mastery in the service of change, characteristics that Freire attributes to the ideal teacher","authors":["Eliane Pawlowski Oliveira Araujo","Claudio Paixão Anastácio de Paula"],"meta":["June 2019Informação em Pauta 4(Especial)","DOI:10.32810/2525-3468.ip.v4iEspecial.2019.41103.62-82"],"references":["333561358_A_dimensao_simbolica_como_perspectiva_heuristica_possibilidades_do_uso_do_imaginario_em_investigacoes_sobre_o_fenomeno_infocomunicacional","321175792_Compartilhamento_de_conhecimento_na_orientacao_academica_a_perspectiva_de_orientadores","321173807_A_forca_do_imaginario_apego_vinculo_e_identidade_academica_como_potencializadores_da_relacao_com_os_egressos"]}
