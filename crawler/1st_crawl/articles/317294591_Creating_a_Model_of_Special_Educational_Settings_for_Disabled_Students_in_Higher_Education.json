The authors discuss requirements for career guidance, application for university admission, academic and psychological support in students with visual impairments and review the system of employment assistance for graduate students with disabilities. The outcomes of the research indicate that project-based learning, active involvement in research and participation in finding solutions to relevant practical tasks promotes high quality training in disabled students.","authors":["Vitaliy Rubtsov","L.G.
