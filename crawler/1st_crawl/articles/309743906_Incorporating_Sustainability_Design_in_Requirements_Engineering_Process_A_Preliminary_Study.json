{"id":"309743906_Incorporating_Sustainability_Design_in_Requirements_Engineering_Process_A_Preliminary_Study","abstract":"Sustainability is usually treated as an after-thought in software engineering practice. The software engineers tend to focus more on the technical dimension rather than the entire sustainability dimension. Designing software sustainability is a big challenge in current software engineering practices due to the lack of well-defined guidelines that provide tangible decomposition of sustainability aspect. Thus, we propose a framework to analyze the sustainability dimension and structure it into software requirements. Moreover, the research goal of this paper is to develop a methodology that determine sustainability requirements. The proposed meta model integrates four sustainability dimensions with the other quality attributes such as performance and usability. The contribution of this work is to help the requirements engineer to incorporate sustainability concern into software system design.","authors":["Theresia Saputri","Seok-Won Lee"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-3256-1_4","Conference: Asia Pacific Requirements Engineering Conference"],"references":["308868573_Sustainability_Design_and_Software_The_Karlskrona_Manifesto","303296728_Sustainability_Design_in_Requirements_Engineering_State_of_Practice","255949688_A_Generic_Model_for_Sustainability_with_Process-_and_Product-specific_Instances","235737601_Application_of_case_study_methodology","228365136_Estimating_Total_Power_Consumption_by_Servers_in_the_US_and_the_World","221560287_Climate_Change_A_Grand_Software_Challenge","221552329_Discovering_Sustainability_Requirements_An_Experience_Report","221389701_Case_Study_Methodology_Designed_Research_in_Software_Engineering_Methodology_Validation","220939760_A_Model_and_Selected_Instances_of_Green_and_Sustainable_Software","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","283754563_Requirements_The_Key_to_Sustainability","271767583_Construct_Validity_in_Psychological_Tests","271767508_Construct_Validity_in_Psychological_Test","261072807_Sustainable_development_sustainable_software_and_sustainable_software_engineering_An_integrated_approach","257226878_World_Commission_on_environment_and_development","251721760_The_GREENSOFT_Model_A_reference_model_for_green_and_sustainable_software_and_its_engineering","247685897_Sustainable_business_strategies_in_the_Internet_economy","234766112_Sustainable_Software_Development_An_Agile_Perspective","224952183_Building_Theory_From_Case_Study_Research","221025106_Goal_Question_Metric","51993094_External_validity_is_more_than_skin_deep_Some_answers_to_criticisms_of_laboratory_experiments"]}
