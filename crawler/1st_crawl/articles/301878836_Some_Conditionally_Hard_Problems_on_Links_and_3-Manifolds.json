{"id":"301878836_Some_Conditionally_Hard_Problems_on_Links_and_3-Manifolds","abstract":"We show that three natural decision problems about links and 3-manifolds are computationally hard, assuming some conjectures in complexity theory. The first problem is determining whether a link in the 3-sphere bounds a Seifert surface with Thurston norm at most a given integer; this is shown to be NP-complete. The second problem is the homeomorphism problem for closed 3-manifolds; this is shown to be at least as hard as the graph isomorphism problem. The third problem is determining whether a given link in the 3-sphere is a sublink of another given link; this is shown to be NP-hard.","authors":["Marc Lackenby"],"meta":["October 2017Discrete & Computational Geometry 58(9)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-017-9905-8"],"references":["301845428_Finding_Non-orientable_Surfaces_in_3-Manifolds","287251089_Graph_Isomorphism_in_Quasipolynomial_Time","344082978_The_computational_complexity_of_knot_genus_and_spanning_area","303907275_Graph_isomorphism_in_quasipolynomial_time_extended_abstract","301879766_The_efficient_certification_of_knottedness_and_Thurston_norm","301876839_Elementary_knot_theory","281312108_Algorithmic_homeomorphism_of_3-manifolds_as_a_corollary_of_geometrization","269722277_On_the_Complexity_of_Immersed_Normal_Surfaces","266536759_Knottedness_is_in_modulo_GRH","265333403_Theorie_der_Normalflachen_Ein_Isotopiekriterium_fur_den_Kreisknoten","265023821_Geometrisation_of_3-manifolds","245604744_Canonical_decompositions_of_3-manifolds","247867825_The_entropy_formula_for_Ricci_flow_and_its_geometric_applications_preprint","247589674_Some_results_on_surfaces_in_3-manifolds","247409373_Ricci_flow_with_surgery_on_3-manifolds_preprint"]}
