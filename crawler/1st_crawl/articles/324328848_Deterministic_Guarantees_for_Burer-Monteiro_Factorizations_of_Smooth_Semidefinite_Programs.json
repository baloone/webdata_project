{"id":"324328848_Deterministic_Guarantees_for_Burer-Monteiro_Factorizations_of_Smooth_Semidefinite_Programs","abstract":"We consider semidefinite programs (SDPs) with equality constraints. The variable to be optimized is a positive semidefinite matrix $X$ of size $n$. Following the Burer-Monteiro approach, we optimize a factor $Y$ of size $n \\times p$ instead, such that $X = YY^T$. This ensures positive semidefiniteness at no cost and can reduce the dimension of the problem if $p$ is small, but results in a non-convex optimization problem with a quadratic cost function and quadratic equality constraints in $Y$. In this paper, we show that if the set of constraints on $Y$ regularly defines a smooth manifold, then, despite non-convexity, first- and second-order necessary optimality conditions are also sufficient, provided $p$ is large enough. For smaller values of $p$, we show a similar result holds for almost all (linear) cost functions. Under those conditions, a global optimum $Y$ maps to a global optimum $X = YY^T$ of the SDP. We deduce old and new consequences for SDP relaxations of the generalized eigenvector problem, the trust-region subproblem and quadratic optimization over several spheres, as well as for the Max-Cut and Orthogonal-Cut SDPs which are common relaxations in stochastic block modeling and synchronization of rotations.","authors":["Nicolas Boumal","Vladislav Voroninski","Afonso S.
