{"id":"223166946_A_database_system_of_mechanical_components_based_on_geometric_and_topological_similarity_Part_I_Representation","abstract":"A database of mechanical components is an important issue for some manufacturing activities such as cost estimation, process planning, and design by case-based reasoning. In this paper, we give the representation scheme of the CAD model in such a database. Components are represented using attributed graphs in which the nodes correspond to the surfaces of the component and the links correspond to the edges of the component. The graph is based on the standard for the exchange of product information (STEP) physical file of the component. STEP file should be unique for a single component regardless of the underlying CAD system. The process of creating the graph of a component constitutes two sub-tasks: (i) importing the CAD model from the CAD system in STEP format and (ii) transforming the STEP data into attributed graph-based representation. The graph and its attributes describe the topology of the component completely together with some geometric data that are not dependent on any coordinate system such as surface type and curve type. These geometric data are helpful in the retrieval and matching processes in the database.","authors":["Mohamed El-Mehalawi","R Allen Miller"],"meta":["January 2003Computer-Aided Design 35(1):83-94","DOI:10.1016/S0010-4485(01)00177-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["279577168_Implementing_the_concurrent_engineering_concept_through_STEP_tools","236649325_Computer_Aided_Process_Planning_The_State-of-the-Art_Survey","220420877_Challenges_in_Feature-Based_Manufacturing_Research","3192542_A_Graduated_Assignment_Algorithm_for_Graph_Matching","3191747_Recognizing_3-D_Objects_Using_Surface_Descriptions","340913211_Estimating_and_Costing_for_the_Metal_Manufacturing_Industries","288142617_Case-based_approach_for_cost_estimating_in_net_shape_manufacturing","242532853_An_Introduction_to_Automated_Process_Planning_Systems","241406053_Design_Representation_for_Manufacturability_Evaluation_in_CAD_Beyond_Feature-based_Design","227042529_Applications_of_group_technology_in_distributed_manufacturing","226590477_Feature_extraction_and_feature_based_design_approaches_in_the_development_of_design_interface_for_process_planning","223568378_A_data_representation_scheme_for_sheetmetal_parts_Expressing_manufacturing_features_and_tolerance_requirements","222987410_A_review_of_solid_shape_modelling_based_on_integrity_verification","222445453_Extracting_process_planning_information_from_various_wire_frame_and_feature_based_CAD_systems","221016522_Computer-Aided_Parts_Estimation","220605052_Computer-Aided_Parts_Estimation","220604979_Design_problem_solving_A_task_analysis","220182972_BONSAI_3-D_object_recognition_using_constrained_search","220182966_CAD-based_computer_vision_From_CAD_models_to_relational_graphs","220182624_Extraction_of_3D_Object_Features_from_CAD_Boundary_Representation_Using_the_Super_Relation_Graph_Method","220134708_Integration_of_Multiple_Feature_Groups_and_Multiple_Views_into_a_3D_Object_Recognition_System","44371716_Parametric_and_feature-based_CADCAM_concepts_techniques_and_applications_Jami_J_Shah_Martti_Mantyla","37597237_Model-Based_Recognition_and_Localization_From_Sparse_Range_or_Tactile_Data","30872588_Case-Based_Reasoning_in_Design","3979569_Knowledge-based_robotics","3979139_Model-based_recognition_and_localization_from_tactile_data","3553462_CAD-based_computer_vision_from_CAD_models_to_relational_graphs","3504685_BONSAI_3D_object_recognition_using_constrained_search","3192145_The_Automatic_Construction_of_a_View-Independent_Relational_Model_for_3-D_Object_Recognition","3191748_CAGD-based_computer_vision","2361067_Feature-based_Similarity_Assessment_of_Solid_Models"]}
