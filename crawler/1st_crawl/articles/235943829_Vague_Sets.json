{"id":"235943829_Vague_Sets","abstract":"A vague set is a set of objects, each of which has a grade of\nmembership whose value is a continuous subinterval of [0,1]. Such a set\nis characterized by a truth-membership function and a false-membership\nfunction. The notion of inclusion, union, intersection, and complement\nare extended to such sets, and various properties of vague sets are\nestablished. Finally, convex vague sets are introduced","authors":["Wen-Long Gau","Daniel Buehrer"],"meta":["April 1993IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics 23(2):610-614","DOI:10.1109/21.229476"],"references":["237076907_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems_Theory_and_Applications","235949590_Vague_Logic_A_First-Order_Extension_of_Interval_Probability_Theory","229708357_Fuzzy_Membership_Mapped_onto_Intervals_and_Many-Valued_Quantities","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","220458890_INFERNO_A_cautious_approach_to_uncertain_inference","23540347_Hierarchie_des_places_centrales_et_graphes_PH-Flous"]}
