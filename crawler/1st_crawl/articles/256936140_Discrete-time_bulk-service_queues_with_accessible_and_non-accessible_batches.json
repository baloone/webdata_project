{"id":"256936140_Discrete-time_bulk-service_queues_with_accessible_and_non-accessible_batches","abstract":"This paper analyzes a discrete-time single-server infinite- (finite-) buffer bulk-service queues. The inter-arrival times of successive arrivals are assumed to be independent and geometrically distributed. The customers are served by a single-server in accessible or non-accessible batches. The service times of batches are also assumed to be independent and geometrically distributed. The steady-state probabilities with computational experiences have been presented.
