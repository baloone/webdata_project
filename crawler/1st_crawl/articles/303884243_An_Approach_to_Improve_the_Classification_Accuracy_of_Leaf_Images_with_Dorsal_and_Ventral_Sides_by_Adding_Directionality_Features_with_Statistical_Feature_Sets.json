{"id":"303884243_An_Approach_to_Improve_the_Classification_Accuracy_of_Leaf_Images_with_Dorsal_and_Ventral_Sides_by_Adding_Directionality_Features_with_Statistical_Feature_Sets","abstract":"The basic purpose of this work is to study statistical feature set obtained from digital leaf image with dorsal and ventral sides and to find the degree of classification accuracy for each dorsal and ventral leaf image dataset. Moreover, the effect of adding directional features to statistical feature set on the overall classification accuracy, is also investigated. The work also studies whether the ventral side of the digital leaf image can be a suitable alternative for classification of leaf image data set or not.","authors":["Arun Kumar","Vinod Patidar","Deepak Khazanchi","Ghanshyam Purohit"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-1023-1_9","In book: Advanced Computing and Communication Technologies (pp.89-97)","Project: I am presently working on extracting shape based features analysis for digital images"],"references":["273525097_2015_Plant_Leaf_Recognition_using_Texture_and_Shape_features_with_Neural_Classifiers","318393766_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","313137853_Colour_and_shape_analysis_techniques_for_weed_detection_in_cereal_fields","312455832_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","268989640_Geometric_Leaf_Classification","266853256_3D_microstructure_modeling_of_long_fiber_reinforced_thermoplastics","224327634_A_geometric_method_to_compute_directionality_features_for_texture_images","51533740_In_situ_characterization_of_the_brain-microdevice_interface_using_Device_Capture_Histology","45604080_Scale_space_approach_to_directional_analysis_of_images"]}
