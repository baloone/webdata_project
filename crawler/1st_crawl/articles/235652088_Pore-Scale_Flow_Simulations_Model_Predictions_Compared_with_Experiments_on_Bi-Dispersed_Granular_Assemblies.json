The numerical model uses a combination of the discrete element method for the solid phase and a novel finite volume formulation for the fluid phase. The solid is modeled as an assembly of spherical particles, where contact interactions are governed by elasto-plastic relations. Incompressible Stokes flow is considered, assuming that inertial forces are small in comparison with viscous forces. Pore geometry and pore connections are defined locally through regular triangulation of spheres, from which a tetrahedral mesh arises. The definition of pore-scale hydraulic conductivities is a key aspect of this model. In this sense, the model is similar to a pore-network model. Permeability measurements on hi-dispersed glass beads are reported and compared with model predictions, validating the definition of local conductivities.","authors":["A.-T.
