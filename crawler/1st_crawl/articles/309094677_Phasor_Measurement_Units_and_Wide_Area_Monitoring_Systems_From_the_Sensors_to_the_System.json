{"id":"309094677_Phasor_Measurement_Units_and_Wide_Area_Monitoring_Systems_From_the_Sensors_to_the_System","abstract":"Phasor Measurement Units and Wide Area Monitoring Systems presents complete coverage of phasor measurement units (PMUs), bringing together a rigorous academic approach and practical considerations on the implementation of PMUs to the power system. In addition, it includes a complete theory and practice of PMU technology development and implementation in power systems. Presents complete coverage of the topic from the measurement to the system, bringing together a rigorous academic approach and practical considerations on the implementation of PMUs to the power system. Includes a complete proposal of implementation for a PMU platform that could be replicated in every laboratory. Covers PMU software compiled for National Instrument HW, a compiled monitoring platform to be used to monitor PMU data and developed custom solutions, and a compiled National Instrument schematic to be executed within a SmartPhone app.","authors":["A.
