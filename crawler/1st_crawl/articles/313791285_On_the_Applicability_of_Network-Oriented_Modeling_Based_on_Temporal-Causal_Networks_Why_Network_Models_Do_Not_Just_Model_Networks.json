{"id":"313791285_On_the_Applicability_of_Network-Oriented_Modeling_Based_on_Temporal-Causal_Networks_Why_Network_Models_Do_Not_Just_Model_Networks","abstract":"In this paper for a Network-Oriented Modelling perspective based on temporal-causal networks it is analysed how generic and applicable it is as a general modelling approach and as a computational paradigm. It is shown that network models do not just model networks.
