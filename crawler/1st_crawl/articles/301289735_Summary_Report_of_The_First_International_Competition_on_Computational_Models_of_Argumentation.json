{"id":"301289735_Summary_Report_of_The_First_International_Competition_on_Computational_Models_of_Argumentation","abstract":"We review the First International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation (ICCMA'15). The competition evaluated submitted solvers performance on four different computational tasks related to solving abstract argumentation frameworks. Each task evaluated solvers in ways that pushed the edge of existing performance by introducing new challenges. Despite being the first competition in this area, the high number of competitors entered, and differences in results, suggest that the competition will help shape the landscape of ongoing developments in argumentation theory solvers.","authors":["Matthias Thimm","Serena Villata","Federico Cerutti","Nir Oren"],"meta":["April 2016Ai Magazine 37(1):102-104","DOI:10.1609/aimag.v37i1.2640"],"references":["282013672_A_Benchmark_Framework_for_a_Computational_Argumentation_Competition","222452074_A_Mathematical_Treatment_of_Defeasible_Reasoning_and_Its_Implementation","316239026_Supporting_reasoning_with_different_types_of_evidence_in_intelligence_analysis","285432624_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_and_logic_programming","283858385_Supporting_reasoning_with_different_types_of_evidence_in_intelligence_analysis","269776983_An_updated_systematic_review_of_lung_chemo-radiotherapy_using_a_new_evidence_aggregation_method","230745922_Argumentation_Schemes","226808352_Complexity_of_Abstract_Argumentation","222464284_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_logic_programming_and_n-person_games_1"]}
