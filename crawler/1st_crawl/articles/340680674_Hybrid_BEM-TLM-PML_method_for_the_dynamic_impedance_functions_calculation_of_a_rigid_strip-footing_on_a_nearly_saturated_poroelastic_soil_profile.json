The rigid footing is perfectly bonded to the soil profile and is subjected to time-harmonic loadings. The soil profile under consideration comprises several horizontal layers with different thicknesses and an underlying half-space or fixed base (layered stratum); these aspects are governed by Biot's theory of poroelastodynamics combined with a simplified approach to consider the saturation effect. The dynamic interaction problem is solved by employing a hybrid formulation combining the Boundary Element Method (BEM), the Thin Layer Method (TLM) and the Perfectly Matched Layer technique (PML), which allows the calculation of Green's functions for the multi-layered poroelastic half-space. Comparisons with the existing results were made to verify the formulation; these are special cases of the more general problems that have been addressed. Select numerical solutions are presented to demonstrate the impact of the boundary conditions at the bottom of the soil profile, geotechnical properties (such as the saturation degree, uniformity coefficient, angle of internal friction, etc.) and non-homogeneity effects on the dynamic impedance functions.","authors":["Raouf Bencharif","Mohamed Hadid","Mezouar Nourredine"],"meta":["April
