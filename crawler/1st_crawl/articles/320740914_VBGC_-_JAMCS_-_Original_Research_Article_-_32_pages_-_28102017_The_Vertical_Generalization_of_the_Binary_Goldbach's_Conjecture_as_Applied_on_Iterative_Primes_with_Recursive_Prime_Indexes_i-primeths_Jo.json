VBGC was discovered by the author of this paper in 2007 and perfected (by computational verifications) until 2017 by using the arrays of matrices of Goldbach index-partitions, which are a useful tool in studying BGC by focusing on prime indexes. VBGC distinguishes as a very important conjecture of primes, with potential importance in the optimization of the BGC experimental verification (including other possible theoretical and practical applications in mathematics and physics) and a very special self-similar property of the primes set.\n\nKeywords: Primes with prime indexes; i-primeths; the Binary Goldbach Conjecture; Goldbach-like\nconjectures; the Vertical Binary Goldbach Conjecture.\n\nDOI : 10.9734/JAMCS/2017/36895\n\n2010 mathematics subject classification: 11N05 (Distribution of primes,\nURL: http://www.ams.org/msc/msc2010.html?t=11N05&btn=Current)\n\nOFFICIAL LINKS OF THIS PUBLISHED (OPEN) PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLE:\nhttp://www.sciencedomain.org/abstract/21625\nhttp://www.sciencedomain.org/issue/3151\nhttp://www.journalrepository.org/media/journals/JAMCS_69/2017/Oct/Andrei2522017JAMCS36895.pdf\nhttp://www.sciencedomain.org/review-history/21625\nhttp://www.sciencedomain.org/metrics/21625\n\nINDEX COPERNICUS:\nhttps://journals.indexcopernicus.com/search/article?articleId=1700660\n\nCROSSREF.ORG meta-data:\nhttps://search.crossref.org/?q=10.9734%2FJAMCS%2F2017%2F36895\n\nOEIS:\nhttps://oeis.org/A282251\n\nVIXRAPEDIA:\nhttps://www.vixrapedia.org/wiki/VBGC\n\nThe exceptions of VBGC(2,0) were also approved on OEIS as A282251.\nhttp://oeis.org/A282251\n-see also the open review history of A282251 sequence at this URL :\nhttp://oeis.org/history?seq=A282251\n\nThe exceptions of VBGC(1,1) were also approved on OEIS as A316460.\nhttp://oeis.org/A316460\n-see the full indexed exceptions list, also called \"b-file\", at this URL:\nhttp://dragoii.com/VBGC(1,1)_ExceptionEvenList_b_file.txt\n-see also the open review history of A316460 sequence at this URL :\nhttp://oeis.org/history?seq=A316460\n\nI have mentioned these approved sequences because Mr. N.
