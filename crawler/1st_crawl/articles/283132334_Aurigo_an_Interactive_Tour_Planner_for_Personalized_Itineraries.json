{"id":"283132334_Aurigo_an_Interactive_Tour_Planner_for_Personalized_Itineraries","abstract":"Planning personalized tour itineraries is a complex and challenging task for both humans and computers. Doing it manually is time-consuming; approaching it as an optimization problem is computationally NP hard. We present Aurigo, a tour planning system combining a recommendation algorithm with interactive visualization to create personalized itineraries. This hybrid approach enables Aurigo to take into account both quantitative and qualitative preferences of the user. We conducted a within-subject study with 10 participants, which demonstrated that Aurigo helped them find points of interest quickly. Most participants chose Aurigo over Google Maps as their preferred tools to create personalized itineraries. Aurigo may be integrated into review websites or social networks, to leverage their databases of reviews and ratings and provide better itinerary recommendations.","authors":["Alexandre Yahi","Antoine Chassang","Louis Raynaud","Hugo Duthil"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1145/2678025.2701366"],"references":["266654488_Where_shall_we_go_today_Planning_touristic_tours_with_TripBuilder","263161234_Adapting_to_the_Internet_Trends_in_Travelers'_Use_of_the_Web_for_Trip_Planning","262242965_Personalized_trip_recommendation_with_multiple_constraints_by_mining_user_check-in_behaviors","261120264_A_Tabu_Search_approach_for_Multi_Constrained_Team_Orienteering_Problem_and_its_application_in_touristic_trip_planning","224265806_Trip-Mine_An_Efficient_Trip_Planning_Approach_with_Travel_Time_Constraints","223710865_Role_of_Social_Media_in_Online_Travel_Information_Search","221267214_Automatic_Construction_of_Travel_Itineraries_using_Social_Breadcrumbs","221023406_Antourage_Mining_distance-constrained_trips_from_Flickr","221022047_Deducing_trip_related_information_from_Flickr","271547267_An_Efficient_Trip_Planning_Algorithm_under_Constraints","262165833_Real-time_trip_planning_with_the_crowd","261319805_Trip_Mining_and_Recommendation_from_Geo-tagged_Photos","261165821_An_Algorithm_for_Trip_Planning_with_Constraint_of_Transfer_Connection_in_Urban_Mass_Transit_Network","260112523_Motivations_for_Sharing_Tourism_Experiences_Through_Social_Media","259677228_Mining_Tourist_Routes_Using_Flickr_Traces","254005175_Human_Computation_Tasks_with_Global_Constraints","251513024_Exploring_the_essence_of_memorable_tourism_experiences","221573773_Photo2Trip_Generating_travel_routes_from_geo-tagged_photos_for_trip_planning","221573137_Mining_people's_trips_from_large_scale_geo-tagged_photos","220355758_INTRIGUE_Personalized_recommendation_of_tourist_attractions_for_desktop_and_handset_devices"]}
