{"id":"257428612_Fast_Polynomial-Space_Algorithms_Using_Inclusion-Exclusion","abstract":"Given a graph with n vertices, k terminals and positive integer weights not larger than c, we compute a minimum Steiner Tree in \n\n$\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{k}c)$\ntime and \n\n$\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(c)$\nspace, where the \n\n$\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}$\nnotation omits terms bounded by a polynomial in the input-size. We obtain the result by defining a generalization of walks, called branching walks, and combining it with the Inclusion-Exclusion technique. Using this combination we also give \n\n$\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{n})$\n-time polynomial space algorithms for Degree Constrained Spanning Tree, Maximum Internal Spanning Tree and #Spanning Forest with a given number of components. Furthermore, using related techniques, we also present new polynomial space algorithms for computing the Cover Polynomial of a graph, Convex Tree Coloring and counting the number of perfect matchings of a graph.","authors":["Jesper Nederlof"],"meta":["April 2013Algorithmica 65(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-012-9630-x"],"references":["234783951_A_generating_function_approach_to_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","228592111_Inclusion_exclusion_for_hard_problems","225107170_Faster_Steiner_Tree_Computation_in_Polynomial-Space","225105985_Dynamic_Programming_for_Minimum_Steiner_Trees","266220665_On_the_Cover_Polynomial_of_a_Digraph","232347229_Dynamic_programming_meets_the_principle_of_inclusion_and_exclusion_1","227780684_The_Steiner_Problem_in_Graphs","226321012_Exact_Algorithms_for_Exact_Satisfiability_and_Number_of_Perfect_Matchings","225330670_Exact_and_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Max_Internal_Spanning_Tree","225152201_Trimmed_Moebius_Inversion_and_Graphs_of_Bounded_Degree"]}
