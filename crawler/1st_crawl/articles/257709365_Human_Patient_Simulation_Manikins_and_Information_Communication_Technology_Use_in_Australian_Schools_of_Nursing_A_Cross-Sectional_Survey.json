{"id":"257709365_Human_Patient_Simulation_Manikins_and_Information_Communication_Technology_Use_in_Australian_Schools_of_Nursing_A_Cross-Sectional_Survey","abstract":"Background\nShortage of suitable quality placements for undergraduate nursing students' clinical experience has motivated Australian schools of nursing to consider alternatives to traditional clinical placements. Human patient simulation manikins and information communication technologies may have the potential to facilitate the development of nursing students' clinical competence within a laboratory environment.MethodA cross-sectional survey of Australian schools of nursing was undertaken to explore the use and types of simulation and information communication technologies and the pedagogical principles underpinning their use.ResultsThis report profiles the facilities, staffing, teaching strategies, and underpinning pedagogical principles currently employed. Survey results show substantial variations in simulation and information communication technology resources and teaching strategies in current use.Conclusion\nAdditional funding and staff training opportunities will be required to ensure adequate facilities and staffing are available to support quality use of these technologies.","authors":["Carol Arthur","Ashley Kable","Tracy Levett-Jones"],"meta":["November 2011Clinical Simulation in Nursing 7(6):e219â€“e227","DOI:10.1016/j.ecns.2010.03.002"],"references":["255965497_Nursing_Midwifery_Research_Methods_and_Appraisal_for_Evidence-Based_Practice","235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","11105248_An_Integrative_Review_of_Computer-based_Simulation_in_the_Education_Process","9083699_Education_Levels_of_Hospital_Nurses_and_Patient_Mortality","8207790_Current_use_and_opinions_regarding_Human_Patient_Simulators_in_nursing_education_an_international_survey","312120601_Simulation_in_Nursing_Education_and_Practice","307731174_The_effectiveness_of_using_human_patient_simulation_manikins_in_the_teaching_of_clinical_reasoning_skills_to_undergraduate_nursing_students_a_systematic_review","292692565_Creating_a_laboratory_that_simulates_the_critical_care_equipment","244857817_Simulation_and_Faculty_Time_Investment","229907640_Effectiveness_of_simulation_on_health_profession_students'_knowledge_skills_confidence_and_satisfaction","24398502_Linking_the_Science_of_Training_to_Nursing_Simulation","23443785_High-Fidelity_Patient_Simulation_and_Nursing_Students'_Self-Efficacy_A_Review_of_the_Literature","14203144_Academic_education_Creating_a_laboratory_that_simulates_the_critical_care_environment","11752812_Informatics_Competencies_for_Nurses_at_Four_Levels_of_Practice","8013132_What_Have_We_Learned_About_Critical_Thinking_in_Nursing","7821020_A_Frame_Work_for_Designing_Implementing_and_Evaluating_Simulations_Used_as_Teaching_Strategies_in_Nursing","7073629_The_Use_of_Personal_Digital_Assistants_at_the_Point_of_Care_in_an_Undergraduate_Nursing_Program","6256015_High-Fidelity_Simulation_and_the_Development_of_Clinical_Judgment_Students'_Experiences","5933561_Taking_the_Patient_to_the_Classroom_Applying_Theoretical_Frameworks_to_Simulation_in_Nursing_Education","5828208_Clinical_Judgment_Development_Using_Simulation_to_Create_an_Assessment_Rubric","5756657_An_Academic-Industry_Partnership_for_Advancing_Technology_in_Health_Science_Education","5662780_Virtual_patients_support_point-of-care_nursing_education"]}
