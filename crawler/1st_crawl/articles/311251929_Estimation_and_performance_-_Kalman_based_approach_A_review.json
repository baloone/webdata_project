{"id":"311251929_Estimation_and_performance_-_Kalman_based_approach_A_review","abstract":"In the process of wireless communication, channel effects are always a factor of degradation in offered quality. Major channel effects such as noise effects, fading, multipathing, Doppler shift etc., results in degradation in the observed quality of service for the communication system. Various approaches are developed towards the appropriate estimation of these channel effects at the receiver side to equalize the channel effects. As the observed channel is highly variant in current scenario, the developments of estimation algorithms are in prime focus for wireless communication researchers. Among the developed approaches, Kalman filtration are been used as a knowledge governed estimation approach in wireless domain. Kalman filters has shown the significance of channel estimation to a higher accuracy, with lower coding complexity. This paper, present an extensive literature review to the developments made in the area of channel estimation using Kalman based filtration approach in wireless communication system.","authors":["G.
