{"id":"352107675_A_singlet-triplet_hole_spin_qubit_in_planar_Ge","abstract":"Spin qubits are considered to be among the most promising candidates for building a quantum processor. Group IV hole spin qubits are particularly interesting owing to their ease of operation and compatibility with Si technology. In addition, Ge offers the option for monolithic superconductor–semiconductor integration. Here, we demonstrate a hole spin qubit operating at fields below 10 mT, the critical field of Al, by exploiting the large out-of-plane hole g-factors in planar Ge and by encoding the qubit into the singlet-triplet states of a double quantum dot. We observe electrically controlled g-factor difference-driven and exchange-driven rotations with tunable frequencies exceeding 100 MHz and dephasing times of 1 μs, which we extend beyond 150 μs using echo techniques. These results demonstrate that Ge hole singlet-triplet qubits are competing with state-of-the-art GaAs and Si singlet-triplet qubits. In addition, their rotation frequencies and coherence are comparable with those of Ge single spin qubits, but singlet-triplet qubits can be operated at much lower fields, emphasizing their potential for on-chip integration with superconducting technologies. A singlet-triplet spin qubit using holes in a Ge quantum well is demonstrated, and can be operated at low magnetic fields of a few millitesla.","authors":["Daniel Jirovec","Andrea Hofmann","Andrea Ballabio","Philipp Mutter"],"meta":["August 2021Nature Materials 20(8):1-7","DOI:10.1038/s41563-021-01022-2"],"references":["350563550_Optimal_operation_points_for_ultrafast_highly_coherent_Ge_hole_spin-orbit_qubits","350359760_A_four-qubit_germanium_quantum_processor","348395744_Ultrafast_hole_spin_qubit_with_gate-tunable_spin-orbit_switch_functionality","343740650_Machine_learning_enables_completely_automatic_tuning_of_a_quantum_device_faster_than_human_experts","343718212_Closed-loop_control_of_a_GaAs-based_singlet-triplet_spin_qubit_with_995_gate_fidelity_and_low_leakage","338561875_Fast_two-qubit_logic_with_holes_in_germanium","347930580_The_germanium_quantum_information_route","342541684_Sensitive_radiofrequency_readout_of_quantum_dots_using_an_ultra-low-noise_SQUID_amplifier","340071329_Resonantly_Driven_Singlet-Triplet_Spin_Qubit_in_Silicon","338905075_Superconductor-semiconductor_hybrid-circuit_quantum_electrodynamics","333461186_Spin-orbit_Interactions_for_Singlet-Triplet_Qubits_in_Silicon","330604317_Shallow_and_Undoped_Germanium_Quantum_Wells_A_Playground_for_Spin_and_Hybrid_Quantum_Technology","334862438_Light_effective_hole_mass_in_undoped_GeSiGe_quantum_wells","330326286_Germanium_Quantum-Well_Josephson_Field-Effect_Transistors_and_Interferometers","330219337_Digital_Coherent_Control_of_a_Superconducting_Qubit"]}
