{"id":"296675440_Balanced_XOR-ed_Coding","abstract":"This paper concerns with the construction of codes over GF(2) which reach the max-flow for single source multicast acyclic networks with delay. The coding is always a bitwise XOR of packets with equal lengths, and is based on highly symmetrical and balanced designs. For certain setups and parameters, our approach offers additional plausible security properties: an adversary needs to eavesdrop at least max-flow links in order to decode at least one original packet.","authors":["Katina Kralevska","Danilo Gligoroski","Harald Ã˜verby"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40552-5_15","Conference: Meeting of the European Network of Universities and Companies in Information and Communication Engineering","Project: Network coding"],"references":["248407006_Weakly_Secure_Network_Coding","244468345_Linear_Versus_Non-Linear_Boolean_Functions_in_Network_Flow","231337901_Optimal_Solution_for_the_Index_Coding_Problem_Using_Network_Coding_overGF2","329786730_Handbook_of_combinatorial_designs","313171841_On_representatives_of_subsets","246355283_CRC_Handbook_of_Combinatorial_Designs","243783020_CRC_Handbook_of_Combinatorial_Designs","241138434_Network_Information_Flow","234739287_Handbook_of_Combinatorial_Designs_Second_Edition_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Its_Applications","230166173_Generating_uniformly_distributed_random_Latin_squares"]}
