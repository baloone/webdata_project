{"id":"352820641_Some_New_Hermite-Hadamard_and_Related_Inequalities_for_Convex_Functions_via_p_q-Integral","abstract":"In this investigation, for convex functions, some new (p, q)-Hermite-Hadamard-type inequalities using the notions of (p, q) π 2 derivative and (p, q) π 2 integral are obtained. Furthermore, for (p, q) π 2-differentiable convex functions, some new (p, q) estimates for midpoint and trapezoidal-type inequalities using the notions of (p, q) π 2 integral are offered. It is also shown that the newly proved results for p = 1 and q → 1 − can be converted into some existing results. Finally, we discuss how the special means can be used to address newly discovered inequalities.","authors":["Miguel Vivas-Cortez","Muhammad Aamir Ali","Hüseyin Budak","Humaira Kalsoom"],"meta":["June 2021Entropy 23(7)","DOI:10.3390/e23070828","Project: Algunas generalizaciones de desigualdades integrales."],"references":["352059611_Quantum_Ostrowski-type_inequalities_for_twice_quantum_differentiable_functions_in_quantum_calculus","352059384_On_some_new_quantum_midpoint-type_inequalities_for_twice_quantum_differentiable_convex_functions","348660303_New_quantum_boundaries_for_quantum_Simpson's_and_quantum_Newton's_type_inequalities_for_preinvex_functions","348549627_C-2021-Some_trapezoid_and_midpoint_type_inequalities_for_newly_defined_quantum_integrals","348323500_Quantum_variant_of_Montgomery_identity_and_Ostrowski-type_inequalities_for_the_mappings_of_two_variables","347303596_Some_new_Simpson's_type_inequalities_for_coordinated_convex_functions_in_quantum_calculus","345139771_New_post_quantum_analogues_of_Ostrowski_type_inequalities_using_new_definitions_of_left-right_pq-derivatives_and_definite_integrals","344166446_Some_New_Newton's_Type_Integral_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions_in_Quantum_Calculus","343071701_Simpson_and_Newton_type_inequalities_for_convex_functions_via_newly_defined_quantum_integrals","343049408_Some_New_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_Like_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions"]}
