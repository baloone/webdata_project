{"id":"321417606_On_density_of_subgraphs_of_halved_cubes","abstract":"Let S be a family of subsets of a set X of cardinality m and VC-dim(S) be the Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension of S. Haussler et al. (1994) proved that if G1(S)=(V,E) is the subgraph of the hypercube Qm induced by S (called the 1-inclusion graph of S), then |E||V|≤VC-dim(S). Haussler (1995) presented an elegant proof of this inequality using the shifting operation.\nIn this note, we adapt the shifting technique to prove that if S is an arbitrary set family and G1,2(S)=(V,E) is the 1,2-inclusion graph of S (i.e., the subgraph of the square Qm2 of the hypercube Qm induced by S), then |E||V|≤d2, where d≔cVC-dim∗(S) is the clique-VC-dimension of S (which we introduce in this paper). The 1,2-inclusion graphs are exactly the subgraphs of halved cubes and comprise subgraphs of Johnson graphs as a subclass.","authors":["Victor Chepoi","Arnaud Labourel","Sébastien Ratel"],"meta":["November 2017European Journal of Combinatorics 80","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2018.02.039"],"references":["321417952_On_density_of_subgraphs_of_Cartesian_products","273640251_Distance-Preserving_Subgraphs_of_Johnson_Graphs","265730766_A_problem_of_Shapozenko_on_Johnson_graphs","242569526_Geometry_of_Cuts_and_Metrics","279347045_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","279069608_VC-dimension_and_Erdos-Posa_property","275501784_Distance_Regular_Graphs","268865969_Global_methods_for_combinatorial_isoperimetric_problems","266560930_Minimax_Analysis_of_Active_Learning","256391598_Distance-preserving_subgraphs_of_hypercubes"]}
