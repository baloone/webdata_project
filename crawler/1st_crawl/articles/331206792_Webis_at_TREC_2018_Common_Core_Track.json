{"id":"331206792_Webis_at_TREC_2018_Common_Core_Track","abstract":"This paper gives a brief overview of the Webis network's participation in the TREC 2018 Common Core track. The basic idea applied in our approach is to axiomatically re-rank the top-50 results of BM25F for those topics that seem to be argumentative. To this end, we use three axioms with the goal of covering some aspects of argumentativeness in text documents. If all three argumentative axioms favor a reordering of two documents, they \"overrule\" the initial ranking and the documents change their ranks.","authors":["Alexander Bondarenko","Michael VÃ¶lske","Alexander Panchenko","Chris Biemann"],"meta":["February 2019","Conference: 27th International Text Retrieval Conference (TREC 2018)","Project: ACQuA: Answering Comparative Questions with Argumentation"],"references":["322582509_Reporting_Score_Distributions_Makes_a_Difference_Performance_Study_of_LSTM-networks_for_Sequence_Tagging","318764068_Axiomatic_Thinking_for_Information_Retrieval_And_Related_Tasks","315866120_Learning_to_Match_using_Local_and_Distributed_Representations_of_Text_for_Web_Search","309469337_Axiomatic_Result_Re-Ranking","301648630_Parsing_Argumentation_Structures_in_Persuasive_Essays","221299969_A_formal_study_of_information_retrieval_heuristics","221299533_Enhancing_relevance_scoring_with_chronological_term_rank"]}
