{"id":"229796842_Cost_Allocation_for_a_Spanning_Tree","abstract":"The problem of cost allocation in a network is of growing importance. In this paper, the authors consider a case of this problem, in which users located at a number of geographically separated points are connected to a center by means of a minimal length (or cost) spanning tree. Such an arrangement can arise for example when several users are connected to a central computer or to a cable TV network; or when rental of a multipoint communications circuit is to be cost allocated. Several of the most obvious cost allocation methods are examined, and some of the disadvantages of each are illustrated. An attempt is made to formulate criteria to be satisfied by an ideal method. Some examples of possible solutions are given.","authors":["A. Claus","D. J. Kleitman"],"meta":["January 1973Networks 3(4):289 - 304","DOI:10.1002/net.3230030402"],"references":[]}
