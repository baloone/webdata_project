{"id":"327475914_On_the_star_forest_polytope_for_trees_and_cycles","abstract":"Let G = ( V , E ) be an undirected graph where the edges in E have non-negative weights. A star in G is either a single node of G or a subgraph of G where all the edges share one common end-node. A star forest is a collection of vertex-disjoint stars in G . The weight of a star forest is the sum of the weights of its edges. This paper deals with the problem of finding a Maximum Weight Spanning Star Forest (MWSFP) in G . This problem is NP -hard but can be solved in polynomial time when G is a cactus [Nguyen, Discrete Math. Algorithms App.7 (2015) 1550018]. In this paper, we present a polyhedral investigation of the MWSFP. More precisely, we study the facial structure of the star forest polytope, denoted by SFP ( G ), which is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of the star forests of G . First, we prove several basic properties of SFP ( G ) and propose an integer programming formulation for MWSFP. Then, we give a class of facet-defining inequalities, called M -tree inequalities, for SFP ( G ). We show that for the case when G is a tree, the M -tree and the nonnegativity inequalities give a complete characterization of SFP ( G ). Finally, based on the description of the dominating set polytope on cycles given by Bouchakour et al. [ Eur. J. Combin.29 (2008) 652–661], we give a complete linear description of SFP ( G ) when G is a cycle.","authors":["Méziane Aïder","Lamia Aoudia","Mourad Baïou","Ali Ridha Mahjoub"],"meta":["September 2018RAIRO - Operations Research 53(5)","DOI:10.1051/ro/2018076"],"references":["230596204_Edge_Dominating_Sets_in_Graphs","325072623_Minimum-Cost_b-Edge_Dominating_Sets_on_Trees","300445672_The_Dominating_Set_Polytope_via_Facility_Location","290706774_Minimum-Cost_b_-Edge_Dominating_Sets_on_Trees","276938742_The_maximum_weight_spanning_star_forest_problem_on_cactus_graphs","268635310_Polytope_Des_Absorbants_Dans_Une_Classe_De_Graphe_a_Seuil","242619830_Fundamentals_of_Domination_in_Graphs","228462673_On_the_Dominating_Set_Polytope_of_a_Cycle","224354151_On_the_Approximability_of_Budgeted_Allocations_and_Improved_Lower_Bounds_for_Submodular_Welfare_Maximization_and_GAP","223671266_One-node_cutsets_and_the_dominating_set_polytope","220992908_Boolean-Width_of_Graphs","220976595_An_Improved_Approximation_Bound_for_Spanning_Star_Forest_and_Color_Saving","220779939_Approximating_the_Spanning_Star_Forest_Problem_and_Its_Applications_to_Genomic_Sequence_Alignment","221462514_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Spanning_Star_Forest_Problem","220789096_On_Variants_of_the_Spanning_Star_Forest_Problem"]}
