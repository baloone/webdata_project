{"id":"228029283_A_Dual_Algorithm_for_the_Constrained_Shortest_Path_Problem","abstract":"In this paper we develop a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm for the problem of finding a shortest path between two nodes in a network, subject to a knapsack-type constraint. For example, we may wish to find a minimum cost route subject to a total time constraint in a multimode transportation network. Furthermore, the problem, which is shown to be at least as hard as NP-complete problems, is generic to a class of problems that arise in the solution of integer linear programs and discrete state/stage deterministic dynamic programs. One approach to solving the problem is to utilize a kth shortest path algorithm, terminating with the first path that satisfies the constraint. This approach is impractical when the terminal value of k is large. Using Lagrangian relaxation we propose a method that is designed to reduce this value of k. Computational results indicate orders of magnitude savings when the approach is applied to large networks.","authors":["Gabriel Y.
