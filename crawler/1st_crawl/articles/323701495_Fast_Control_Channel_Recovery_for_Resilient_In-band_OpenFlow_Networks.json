{"id":"323701495_Fast_Control_Channel_Recovery_for_Resilient_In-band_OpenFlow_Networks","abstract":"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a thriving paradigm in computer networks where control plane is portrayed as a logically centralized entity decoupled from the data plane. Forwarding decisions at the data plane rely on installation of rules by the control plane through the control channel. Therefore, control channel resilience represents a critical requirement for SDN-based networks. Moreover, control channel leverages the links in the data plane in case of in-band control. To protect the control traffic in this case, we propose a scheme that combines logical ring topology with source-routed forwarding to enable local recovery from failure. This recovery does not require\nintervention by the controller, while preserving the simplicity of data plane devices. Simulation results on a real network topology show that the proposed scheme can recover from multiple link failures within 50ms. In our approach, failure recovery time is unaffected by control channel latency and, more specifically, we show that a link failure approximately 4,920km away from the controller (control channel latency of approximately 16.4ms) can be recovered within 3.8ms.","authors":["A.
