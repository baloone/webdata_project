{"id":"353932294_Partial_discharge_detection_with_on-chip_spiral_inductor_as_a_loop_antenna","abstract":"In this paper, a pioneer partial discharge (PD) loop antenna sensor is presented and examined. The latter is made of a 70-turn square planar inductor, with a 1.8 mm-side length, fabricated on top of a silicon substrate in CMOS technology. The microsensor ability to detect corona PD is demonstrated once connected in series with a 60 dB gain amplifier. The behavior is studied at different separation distances from the line through which the PD pulses ï¬‚ow. At 5 cm away, a damped sinusoidal induced voltage with amplitude of about 100 mV has been measured. The output signal spectrum is highly concentrated around a central resonance frequency of ~5MHz. The microsensor response is compared to those of other industrial sensors from Techimp, i.e. horn antenna and the HFCT sensor. The presented on-chip sensor can be considered a non-intrusive competing solution compared to other heavy and expensive commercial sensors due to its lightweight, compact size, and low cost. In addition, it shows an acceptable signal to noise ratio compared to other commercial EM-waves based sensors.","authors":["Najeh Zeidi","Sinda Kaziz","Mohamed Hadj said","Libor Rufer"],"meta":["September 2021The Review of scientific instruments","DOI:10.1063/5.0051419"],"references":["349543541_Partial_discharge_breakdown_characteristics_under_needle-plate_defect_configuration","339667144_Wideband_UHF_Antenna_for_Partial_Discharge_Detection","338970658_A_magnetic_loop_antenna_for_partial_discharge_measurements_on_GIS","329491073_Development_of_UHF_Sensors_for_Partial_Discharge_Detection_in_Power_Transformer","328307131_Magnetic-Field_CMOS_Microsensor_for_Low-Energy_Electric_Discharge_Detection","326504141_Behavior_of_an_Inductive_Loop_Sensor_in_the_Measurement_of_Partial_Discharge_Pulses_with_Variations_in_Its_Separation_from_the_Primary_Conductor","324088835_A_Comparison_of_Inductive_Sensors_in_the_Characterization_of_Partial_Discharges_and_Electrical_Noise_Using_the_Chromatic_Technique","339398209_Performances_Evaluation_of_On-Chip_Large-Size-Tapped_Transformer_for_MEMS_Applications","323817729_Design_and_application_of_loop_antenna_for_partial_discharge_induced_electromagnetic_wave_detection","322219178_Comparison_of_peak_to_peak_voltage_and_number_of_partial_discharge_detected_by_HFCT_and_loop_antenna_in_metal_enclosed_high_voltage_equipment","278746423_Inductances_planaires_integrees_a_couches_magnetiques_Conception_-_Fabrication_-_Caracterisation_-_Modelisation","274258611_Application_of_HFCT_and_UHF_Sensors_in_On-Line_Partial_Discharge_Measurements_for_Insulation_Diagnosis_of_High_Voltage_Equipment","306118390_Optimization_of_a_High-Frequency_Current_Transformer_Sensor_for_Partial_Discharge_Detection_Using_Finite-Element_Analysis","286066835_Design_and_analysis_of_spiral_inductors","275221971_Development_of_Loop_Antennas_for_Partial_Discharge_Detection"]}
