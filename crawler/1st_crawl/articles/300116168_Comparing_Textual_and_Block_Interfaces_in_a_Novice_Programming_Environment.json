{"id":"300116168_Comparing_Textual_and_Block_Interfaces_in_a_Novice_Programming_Environment","abstract":"Visual, block-based programming environments present an alternative way of teaching programming to novices and have proven successful in classrooms and informal learning settings. However, few studies have been able to attribute this success to specific features of the environment. In this study, we isolate the most fundamental feature of these environments, the block interface, and compare it directly to its textual counterpart. We present analysis from a study of two groups of novice programmers, one assigned to each interface, as they completed a simple programming activity. We found that while the interface did not seem to affect users' attitudes or perceived difficulty, students using the block interface spent less time off task and completed more of the activity's goals in less time.","authors":["Thomas W.
