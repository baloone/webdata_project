{"id":"265127820_Traveling_Wave_Solutions_of_Seventh-order_Generalized_KdV_Equations_Using_He's_Polynomials","abstract":"In this paper, we apply He's polynomials to investigate propagating traveling solitary wave solutions of seventh order generalized KdV (SOG-KdV) equations which play a very important role in mathematical physics and engineering as well. The suggested algorithm is quite efficient and is practically well suited for use in these problems. The suggested iterative scheme leads to the needed solution without any discretization, linearization or restrictive assumptions. The fact that proposed scheme solves nonlinear problems without using the Adomian's polynomials can be considered as a clear advantage of this algorithm over the decomposition method.","authors":["Syed Tauseef Mohyud-Din","Muhammad Aslam Noor","Khlaida Inayat  Noor"],"meta":["February 2009International Journal of Nonlinear Sciences and Numerical Simulation 10(2):223-229","DOI:10.1515/IJNSNS.2009.10.2.227"],"references":["257506946_Modified_Variational_Iteration_Method_for_Heat_and_Wave-Like_Equations","238948680_An_Elementary_Introduction_to_Recently_Developed_Asymptotic_Methods_and_Nanomechanics_in_Textile_Engineering","226675453_Modified_variational_iteration_method_for_solving_Helmholtz_equations","225240312_Variational_iteration_method_for_solving_twelfth-order_boundary-value_problems_using_He's_polynomials","220096145_An_efficient_algorithm_for_solving_fifth-order_boundary_value_problems","26523224_Variational_Homotopy_Perturbation_Method_for_Solving_Higher_Dimensional_Initial_Boundary_Value_Problems","26512576_Variational_Iteration_Method_for_Fifth-Order_Boundary_Value_Problems_Using_He's_Polynomials","26501796_Homotopy_Perturbation_Method_for_Solving_Fourth-Order_Boundary_Value_Problems","238921020_Homotopy_perturbation_method_for_solving_boundary_value_problems","226824737_Modified_variational_iteration_method_for_solving_fourth-order_boundary_value_problems","223152410_Comparison_of_homotopy_method_and_homotopy_analysis_method","223145795_Travelling_solitary_wave_solutions_to_a_seventh-order_generalized_KdV_equation","223010089_An_explicit_and_numerical_solution_of_some_fifth-order_KdV_equation_by_decomposition_method","222360786_He's_homotopy_perturbation_method_for_a_boundary_layer_equation_in_unbounded_domain","222291920_Travelling_wave_solutions_to_a_seventh_order_generalized_KdV_equation","222142710_An_application_of_the_decomposition_method_for_the_generalized_KDV_and_RLW_equations","222073069_The_homotopy_perturbation_method_for_nonlinear_oscillators_with_discontinuities","222000656_Homotopy_perturbation_method_for_solving_sixth-order_boundary_value_problems"]}
