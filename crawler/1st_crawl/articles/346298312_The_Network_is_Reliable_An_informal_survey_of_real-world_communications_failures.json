{"id":"346298312_The_Network_is_Reliable_An_informal_survey_of_real-world_communications_failures","abstract":"The network is reliable tops Peter Deutsch’s classic list, \"Eight fallacies of distributed computing\", \"all [of which] prove to be false in the long run and all [of which] cause big trouble and painful learning experiences.\" Accounting for and understanding the implications of network behavior is key to designing robust distributed programs; in fact, six of Deutsch’s \"fallacies\" directly pertain to limitations on networked communications. This should be unsurprising: the ability (and often requirement) to communicate over a shared channel is a defining characteristic of distributed programs, and many of the key results in the field pertain to the possibility and impossibility of performing distributed computations under particular sets of network conditions.","authors":["Peter Bailis","Kyle Kingsbury"],"meta":["July 2014Queue 12(7):20-32","DOI:10.1145/2639988.2655736"],"references":["262163386_Eventual_Consistency_Today_Limitations_Extensions_and_Beyond","220431045_Impossibility_of_Distributed_Consensus_with_One_Faulty_Process","269031929_California_fault_lines","260127549_Coordination-Avoiding_Database_Systems","221164664_Understanding_Network_Failures_in_Data_Centers_Measurement_Analysis_and_Implications","220476540_Consistency_Tradeoffs_in_Modern_Distributed_Database_System_Design_CAP_is_Only_Part_of_the_Story","200031669_Consistency_in_Partitioned_Networks","2567049_Consensus_in_the_Presence_of_Partial_Synchrony","2540896_Brewer's_Conjecture_and_the_Feasibility_of_Consistent_Available_Partition-Tolerant_Web_Services"]}
