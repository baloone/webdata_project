{"id":"356603747_Computation_of_Polynomial_Degree-Based_Topological_Descriptors_of_Indu-Bala_Product_of_Two_Paths","abstract":"Cheminformatics is entirely a newly coined term that encompasses a field that includes engineering computer sciences along with basic sciences. As we all know, vertices and edges form a network whereas vertex and its degrees contribute to joining edges. The degree of vertex is very much dependent on a reasonable proportion of network properties. There is no doubt that a network has to have a reliance of different kinds of hub buses, serials, and other connecting points to constitute a system that is the backbone of cheminformatics. The Indu-Bala product of two graphs G1 and G2 has a special notation as described in Section 2. The attainment of this product is very much due to related vertices at to different places of G1∨G2. This study states we have found M-polynomial and degree-based topological indices for Indu-Bala product of two paths Pk and Pj for j,k≥2. We also give some graphical representation of these indices and analyzed them graphically.","authors":["Ghazanfar Abbas","Muhammad Ibrahim"],"meta":["November 2021Journal of Chemistry 2021(9)","DOI:10.1155/2021/6281596"],"references":["344891520_The_forgotten_index_of_complement_graph_operations_and_its_applications_of_molecular_graph","301314117_The_hyper-Zagreb_index_and_some_graph_operations_199","338725396_Weighted_Mostar_indices_as_measures_of_molecular_peripheral_shapes_with_applications_to_graphene_graphyne_and_graphdiyne_nanoribbons","334005216_Polarizability_Characterization_of_Zeolitic_Bnpnsted_Acidic_Sites","323942552_Valency-based_topological_descriptors_of_chemical_networks_and_their_applications","303120625_A_formula_for_the_Wiener_number_of_trees_and_its_extension_to_graphs_containing_cycles","284397829_The_Structures_of_the_Minerals_of_the_Sodalite_Family","283205746_First_reformulated_zagreb_index_and_some_graph_operations","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","265383803_On_topological_indices_of_certain_interconnection_networks","262490136_Computation_of_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","257297085_On_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Silicate_Honeycomb_and_Hexagonal_Networks","255687885_On_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Silicate_Honeycomb_and_Hexagonal_Networks","265358564_On_two_conjectures_of_Graffiti","258053902_SiC2_Siligraphene_and_Nanotubes_Novel_Donor_Materials_in_Excitonic_Solar_Cells"]}
