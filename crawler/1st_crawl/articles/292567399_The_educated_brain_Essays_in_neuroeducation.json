{"id":"292567399_The_educated_brain_Essays_in_neuroeducation","abstract":"The emerging field of neuroeducation, concerned with the interaction between mind, brain and education, has proved revolutionary in educational research, introducing concepts, methods and technologies into many advanced institutions around the world. The Educated Brain presents a broad overview of the major topics in this new discipline: part I examines the historical and epistemological issues related to the mind/brain problem and the scope of neuroeducation; part II provides a view of basic brain research in education and use of imaging techniques, and the study of brain and cognitive development; and part III is dedicated to the neural foundations of language and reading in different cultures and the acquisition of basic mathematical concepts. With contributions from leading researchers in the field, this book features the most recent and advanced research in cognitive neurosciences. © Pontifical Academy of Sciences and Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.","authors":["A.M.
