{"id":"324954640_Syntactic_Semantics_and_the_Proper_Treatment_of_Computationalism","abstract":"Computationalism should not be the view that (human) cognition is computation; it should be the view that cognition (simpliciter) is computable. It follows that computationalism can be true even if (human) cognition is not the result of computations in the brain. If semiotic systems are systems that interpret signs, then both humans and computers are semiotic systems. Finally, minds can be considered as virtual machines implemented in certain semiotic systems, primarily the brain, but also AI computers.","authors":["William Rapaport"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.4018/978-1-5225-5622-0.ch007","In book: Empirical Research on Semiotics and Visual Rhetoric (pp.128-176)"],"references":["288859881_Semiotic_Machine","283437470_Symbols_Integrated_cognition_and_language","277224413_The_Computational_Theory_of_Mind","274152370_Computationalism","269736082_How_to_make_the_World_Fit_Our_Language","269542228_Peirce_and_Turing_Comparisons_and_conjectures","267795218_A_Computational_Theory_of_Early_Mathematical_Cognition","263196439_Yes_She_Was_Reply_to_Ford's_Helen_Keller_Was_Never_in_a_Chinese_Room","251193742_Commonsense_and_Embodied_Agents_A_Panel_Discussion","344896617_Plans_and_the_structure_of_behavior","344896614_Syntax_Without_Natural_Selection_How_Compositionality_Emerges_from_Vocabulary_in_a_Population_of_Learners","336972167_Some_Consequences_of_Four_Incapacities","335804255_Non-Existent_Objects_and_Epistemological_Ontology","329954562_The_Mind_Doesn't_Work_That_Way_The_Scope_and_Limits_of_Computational_Psychology","324340722_The_Emperor's_New_Mind_Concerning_Computers_Minds_and_the_Laws_of_Physics","324296915_Foundations_of_Cyclopean_Perception","319770401_Vision_A_Computational_Investigation_into_the_Human_Representation_and_Processing_of_Visual_Information","319393728_The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem","313772546_Individualism_and_Psychology","313097840_Minds_brains_and_programs","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","304037162_How_Does_a_Molecule_Become_a_Message","292024788_The_Meaning_of_'Meaning","290922073_LOT_2_The_Language_of_Thought_Revisited","290021348_Measurement-Theoretic_Representation_and_Computation-Theoretic_Realization","279419194_Studies_in_Cognitive_Systems","277878688_Minds_Machines_and_Godel_A_Retrospect","277815097_Text_Context_Pretext_Critical_Issues_in_Discourse_Analysis","277668452_An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding","277400308_On_computation_and_cognition_Toward_a_foundation_of_cognitive_science","276034303_What_Might_Cognition_Be_if_Not_Computation","274025571_Minds_and_Machines","273236149_Aaron's_Code_Meta-Art_Artificial_Intelligence_and_the_Work_of_Harold_Cohen","272574686_The_Development_of_a_Classification_Scheme_of_Contextual_Aids","271018659_The_Foundations_of_Language","270268372_The_Algorists","270152619_The_Computer_and_the_Mind_An_Introduction_to_Cognitive_Science","270150099_IMM_Introduction_to_metamathematics","268618547_The_Conscious_Mind_In_Search_of_a_Fundamental_Theory","266551698_Understanding_numbers_in_elementary_school_mathematics","266316623_The_Language_of_Thought_Language_Thought_Series","265865380_Hot_Thought_Mechanisms_and_Applications_of_Emotional_Cognition","265340353_Understanding_computers_and_cognition_A_new_foundation_for_design","262411821_Individualism_and_Psychology","259982099_A_Treatise_of_Human_Nature","255675719_The_limits_of_correctness","254205057_Logical_machines","253153463_Godel's_Theorem_An_IncompleteGuide_to_Its_Use_and_Abuse","251142745_Computational_Explanation_and_Mechanistic_Explanation_of_Mind","250397791_Embodied_Enumeration_Appealing_to_Activities_for_Mathematical_Explanation","249666349_In_Defense_of_Contextual_Vocabulary_Acquisition_How_to_do_Things_with_Words_in_Context","249544408_The_GLAIR_cognitive_architecture","248419234_What_could_cognition_be_if_not_computation","248261974_Using_Context_Clues_in_Word_Recognition_and_Comprehension","248003797_The_Semantic_Tradition_From_Kant_to_Carnap_To_the_Vienna_Station"]}
