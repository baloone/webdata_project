{"id":"321125129_Automata_in_the_Category_of_Glued_Vector_Spaces","abstract":"In this paper we adopt a category-theoretic approach to the conception of automata classes enjoying minimization by design. The main instantiation of our construction is a new class of automata that are hybrid between deterministic automata and automata weighted over a field.","authors":["Thomas Colcombet","Daniela Petri≈üan"],"meta":["November 2017"],"references":["320944321_Automata_Minimization_a_Functorial_Approach","265316273_Minimization_via_Duality","262233701_Algebra-Coalgebra_Duality_in_Brzozowski's_Minimization_Algorithm","262158696_A_Coalgebraic_Perspective_on_Minimization_and_Determinization","256720362_On_the_definition_of_a_family_of_automata","246831035_Minimal_realization_of_machines_in_closed_categories","222632219_Adjoint_machines_state-behavior_machines_and_duality","222416096_Limits_of_small_functors","220247234_Subsequential_transducers_A_coalgebraic_perspective","220154587_Sequential","50387705_A_Coalgebraic_Perspective_on_Linear_Weighted_Automata"]}
