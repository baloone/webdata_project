{"id":"245422243_J-Integral_Estimates_for_StrainHardening_Materials_in_Ductile_Fracture_Problems","abstract":"A finite-element procedure is developed to analyze plane ductile fracture problems in the presence of largescale yielding near the crack tip. Strain and stress singularities near the crack tip, corresponding to the strainhardening material model, are embedded in elements near the crack tip. The developed elastic-plastic incremental finite-element method is based on a hybrid displacement model. The results for the J-integral at various load levels, for several standard fracture-toughness test specimens, are compared with available experimental results. The implication of the results in predicting initiation of crack growth, and its stability, in ductile materials is discussed. Â© 1977 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.
