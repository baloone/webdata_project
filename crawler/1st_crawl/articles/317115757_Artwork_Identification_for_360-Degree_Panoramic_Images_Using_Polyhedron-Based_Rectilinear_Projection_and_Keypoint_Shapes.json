{"id":"317115757_Artwork_Identification_for_360-Degree_Panoramic_Images_Using_Polyhedron-Based_Rectilinear_Projection_and_Keypoint_Shapes","abstract":"With the increased development of 360-degree production technologies, artwork has recently been photographed without authorization. To prevent this infringement, we propose an artwork identification methodology for 360-degree images. We transform the 360-degree image into a three-dimensional sphere and wrap it with a polyhedron. On the sphere, several points are located on the polyhedron to determine the width, height, and direction of the rectilinear projection. The 360-degree image is divided and transformed into several rectilinear projected images to reduce the adverse effects from the distorted panoramic image. We also propose a method for improving the identification precision of artwork located at a highly distorted position using the difference of keypoint shapes. After applying the proposed methods, identification precision is increased by 45% for artwork that is displayed on a 79-inch monitor in a seriously distorted position with features that were generated by scale-invariant feature transformations.","authors":["Jin Xun","Jong-Weon Kim"],"meta":["May 2017Applied Sciences 7(6):528","DOI:10.3390/app7050528"],"references":["309672119_Target_Matching_Recognition_for_Satellite_Images_Based_on_the_Improved_FREAK_Algorithm","333339910_A_Survey_on_Object_Detection_Classification_and_Tracking_Method","323333095_High-Speed_Recognition_Algorithm_Based_on_BRISK_and_Saliency_Detection_for_Aerial_Images","321106565_Machine_learning_for_high-speed_corner_detection","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","315364797_ArtWork_recognition_in_360-degree_image_using_32-hedron_based_rectilinear_projection_and_scale_invariant_feature_transform","313508766_Selection_of_histograms_of_oriented_gradients_features_for_pedestrian_detection","313169338_Object_recognition_using_local_affine_frames_on_maximally_stable_extremal_regions","313139882_Multi-scale_Image_Segmentation_Using_MSER_and_its_Application"]}
