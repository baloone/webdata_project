{"id":"259528490_Connectivity-preserving_Geometry_Images","abstract":"We propose connectivity-preserving geometry images (CGIMs), which map a\nthree-dimensional mesh onto a rectangular regular array of an image, such that\nthe reconstructed mesh produces no sampling errors, but merely round-off\nerrors. We obtain a V-matrix with respect to the original mesh, whose elements\nare vertices of the mesh, which intrinsically preserves the vertex-set and the\nconnectivity of the original mesh in the sense of allowing round-off errors. We\ngenerate a CGIM array by using the Cartesian coordinates of corresponding\nvertices of the V-matrix. To reconstruct a mesh, we obtain a vertex-set and an\nedge-set by collecting all the elements with different pixels, and all\ndifferent pairwise adjacent elements from the CGIM array respectively. Compared\nwith traditional geometry images, CGIMs achieve minimum reconstruction errors\nwith an efficient parametrization-free algorithm via elementary permutation\ntechniques. We apply CGIMs to lossy compression of meshes, and the experimental\nresults show that CGIMs perform well in reconstruction precision and detail\npreservation.","authors":["Shaofan Wang","Dehui Kong","Weijia Zhu","Min Xu"],"meta":["December 2013The Visual Computer 31(9)","DOI:10.1007/s00371-014-1000-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["224724598_MESH_Measuring_Errors_between_Surfaces_Using_the_Hausdorff_Distance","224239966_Modeling_and_Compressing_3-D_Facial_Expressions_Using_Geometry_Videos","224223973_Using_Facial_Symmetry_to_Handle_Pose_Variations_in_Real-World_3D_Face_Recognition","221316562_Rectangular_multi-chart_geometry_images","221115946_Geometric_texture_synthesis_and_transfer_via_geometry_images","220183860_Feature-Preserving_Triangular_Geometry_Images_for_Level-of-Detail_Representation_of_Static_and_Skinned_Meshes","220068088_Differential_geometry_images_Remeshing_and_morphing_with_local_shape_preservation","38412934_Geometry_Images","6630515_Intraclass_Retrieval_of_Nonrigid_3D_Objects_Application_to_Face_Recognition","6506621_Three-Dimensional_Face_Recognition_in_the_Presence_of_Facial_Expressions_An_Annotated_Deformable_Model_Approach","5383344_Adaptive_Geometry_Image","313636599_Mesh_Measuring_errors_between_surfaces_using_the_hausdorff_distance","291643445_Triangle_strip_compression_based_on_cluster_parallel_rendering","261461816_Compound_image_compression_by_multi-stage_prediction","229730192_Geometry_Images_of_Arbitrary_Genus_in_the_Spherical_Domain","225871598_Shape_Compression_using_Spherical_Geometry_Images","225758274_Geometric_signal_compression","221316502_Smooth_Geometry_Images","220852917_Signal-Specialized_Parametrization","220183908_Spherical_Parametrization_and_Remeshing","38412937_Texture_Mapping_Progressive_Meshes","38412928_Multi-Chart_Geometry_Images","31150786_How_to_Draw_a_Graph"]}
