{"id":"335381561_Creating_a_Queer_Ontology_The_Gender_Sex_and_Sexual_Orientation_GSSO_Ontology","abstract":"Cultural attitudes, linguistic variation, and historical pathology have led to a plethora of terms concerning gender, sex, and sexual orientation that have caused confusion and uneasiness among both lay people and relevant professionals. For members of the LGBTQIA+ community, these negative reactions are compounded by identities which have historically and contemporarily been mistreated by medical professionals. In an effort to provide a reliable resource for patients and clinicians, we have created the Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation (GSSO) ontology, which currently includes over 4,000 entities from multiple disciplines. The GSSO is a manually curated resource utilizing related glossaries from biology, medicine, psychology, sociology, and gender studies. With links to over 20 other ontology resources such as SNOMED-CT and MedDRA, the GSSO aims for accessibility and interoperability with existing systems. It is also open-source and features an easy-to-use web interface (https://github.com/Superraptor/GSSO). Future work involves multiple language support efforts and empirical evaluation.","authors":["Clair Kronk","Giao Q Tran","Danny T Y Wu"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.3233/SHTI190213"],"references":["327357315_Representing_vaccine_misinformation_using_ontologies","320882524_Discrimination_Increases_Suicidal_Ideation_in_Black_Adolescents_Regardless_of_Ethnicity_and_Gender","303499206_MIMIC-III_a_freely_accessible_critical_care_database","284029033_Transgender_Stigma_and_Health_A_Critical_Review_of_Stigma_Determinants_Mechanisms_and_Interventions","274781123_The_role_of_ontologies_in_biological_and_biomedical_research_A_functional_perspective","258529470_How_Statewide_LGB_Policies_Go_From_Under_Our_Skin_to_Into_Our_Hearts_Fatherhood_Aspirations_and_Psychological_Well-Being_Among_Emerging_Adult_Sexual_Minority_Men","228857266_A_survey_of_ontology_evaluation_techniques","224911824_Completely_out-at-sea_with_two-gender_medicine_A_qualitative_analysis_of_physician-side_barriers_to_providing_healthcare_for_transgender_patients","49735421_Suicide_and_Suicide_Risk_in_Lesbian_Gay_Bisexual_and_Transgender_Populations_Review_and_Recommendations","41028338_The_Impact_of_Institutional_Discrimination_on_Psychiatric_Disorders_in_Lesbian_Gay_and_Bisexual_Populations_A_Prospective_Study","5920102_Patient-provider_interaction_from_the_perspectives_of_type_2_diabetes_patients_in_Muscat_Oman_A_qualitative_study","319155845_Association_of_Self-Reported_Discrimination_and_Suicide_Ideation_in_Older_Chinese_Americans","315933735_Patient-Provider_Communication_and_Health_Outcomes_Among_Individuals_With_Atherosclerotic_Cardiovascular_Disease_in_the_United_States_Medical_Expenditure_Panel_Survey_2010_to_2013","303038145_LGBT_adolescents_in_America_Depression_discrimination_and_suicide","280602606_Perceived_ethnic_and_language-based_discrimination_and_Latina_immigrant_women's_health","228000859_Time_and_the_Patient-Physician_Relationship","222402709_Methodologies_tools_and_languages_for_building_ontologies_Where_is_their_meeting_point","221934868_The_Importance_of_Good_Communication_Between_Patient_and_Health_Professionals","41420410_RacialEthnic_Discrimination_in_Health_Care_Impact_on_Perceived_Quality_of_Care","23192590_Perceived_Discrimination_in_Health_Care_and_Health_Status_in_a_Racially_Diverse_Sample","15469879_Effective_Physician-Patient_Communication_and_Health_Outcomes_A_Review","11229839_Unequal_Treatment_Confronting_Racial_and_Ethnic_Disparities_in_Health_Care"]}
