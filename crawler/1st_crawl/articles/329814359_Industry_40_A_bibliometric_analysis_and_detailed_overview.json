{"id":"329814359_Industry_40_A_bibliometric_analysis_and_detailed_overview","abstract":"With the arrival of Industry 4.0, the overall transformation using digital integration and intelligent engineering has taken a giant leap towards futuristic technology. All devices today are equipped with machine learning, automation has become a priority and thus another industrial revolution is in the making. In this state-of-the-art paper, we have performed bibliometric analysis and an extensive survey on recent developments in the field of “Industry 4.0”. In bibliometric analysis, different performance metrics are extracted, such as: total papers, total citations, and citation per paper. Further, top 10 of the most productive and highly cited authors, major subject areas, sources or journals, countries, and institutions are evaluated. A list of highly influential papers is also assessed. Later on, a detailed discussion of the most cited papers is analysed and a sectional classification is provided. This paper summarizes the growth structure of Industry 4.0 during the last 5 years and provides the concise background overview of Industry 4.0 related works and various application areas.","authors":["Pranab K.
