{"id":"263414075_Vortex_shedding_modeling_using_diffusive_van_der_Pol_oscillators","abstract":"A simple model for the near wake dynamics of slender bluff bodies in cross-flow is analyzed. It is based on a continuous distribution of van der Pol oscillators arranged along the spanwise extent of the structure and interacting by diffusion. Diffusive interaction is shown to be able to model cellular vortex shedding in shear flow, the cell size being estimated analytically with respect to the model parameters. Moreover, diffusive interaction succeeds in describing qualitatively the global suppression of vortex shedding from a sinuous structure in uniform flow.","authors":["Matteo Luca Facchinetti","Emmanuel de Langre","Francis Biolley"],"meta":["July 2002Comptes Rendus Mecanique 330(7)","DOI:10.1016/S1631-0721(02)01492-4"],"references":["230778079_On_cell_formation_in_vortex_streets","13230466_Memory-Induced_Low_Frequency_Oscillations_in_Closed_Convection_Boxes","253991898_Phase_dynamics_of_Karman_vortices_in_cylinder_wakes","253404595_Vortex_Shedding_From_Bluff_Bodies_in_a_Shear_Flow_A_Review","245225315_Reduction_of_bluff-body_drag_and_suppression_of_vortex_shedding_by_the_introduction_of_wavy_separation_lines","244964323_A_nonlinear_oscillator_model_for_vortex_shedding_from_cylinders_and_cones_in_uniform_and_shear_flows","241620147_A_low-order_model_for_vortex_shedding_patterns_behind_vibrating_flexible_cables","235585087_Dislocation_motion_in_cellular_structures","234409041_Flow-Induced_Vibration","231909495_An_experimental_study_of_vortex_shedding_behind_linearly_tapered_cylinders_at_low_Reynolds_number","231872379_Vortex_shedding_from_slender_cones_at_low_Reynolds_number","231859052_Vortex_Shedding_from_Slender_Cones_at_Low_Reynolds_Numbers"]}
