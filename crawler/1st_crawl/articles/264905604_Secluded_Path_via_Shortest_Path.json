{"id":"264905604_Secluded_Path_via_Shortest_Path","abstract":"We provide several new algorithmic results for the secluded path problem, specifically approximation and optimality results for the static algorithm of [3,5], and an extension (h-Memory) of it based on de Bruijn graphs, when applied to bounded degree graphs and some other special graph classes which can model wireless communication and line-of-sight settings. Our primary result is that h-Memory is a PTAS for degree-Δ unweighted, undirected graphs, providing a \\(\\lceil{\\sqrt{{\\Delta+1}\\over{h+1}}}\\rceil\\)-approximation in time O(n logn); in particular, 0-Memory (i.e., static) provides a \\(\\sqrt{\\Delta+1}\\) -approximation (i.e., \\(\\epsilon=\\sqrt{\\Delta+1}-1\\)), tightening the previous analysis of this algorithm, and Δ-Memory is optimal (i.e., ε = 0), and is faster than the known optimal algorithm for this setting [3].\nWe also show that 0-Memory and 1-Memory give constant approximations for unit-disk graphs and planar graphs, and that an extension of h-Memory solves many other tessellation graphs. Finally, we prove that the problem is NP-hard on node-weighted graphs of degree 3.","authors":["Matthew P.
