{"id":"269999117_CONSRANK_A_server_for_the_analysis_comparison_and_ranking_of_docking_models_based_on_inter-residue_contacts","abstract":"Herein we present CONSRANK, a web tool for analyzing, comparing and ranking protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid docking models, based on the conservation of inter-residue contacts and its visualization in 2D and 3D interactive contact maps. Availability: CONSRANK is accessible as a public web tool at https://www.molnac.unisa.it/BioTools/consrank/ CONTACT: romina.oliva@uniparthenope.it.\nÂ© The Author (2014).
