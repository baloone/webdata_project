{"id":"284755161_Dissolved_oxygen_prediction_using_a_possibility-theory_based_fuzzy_neural_network","abstract":"A new fuzzy neural network method to predict minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in a highly urbanised riverine environment (in Calgary, Canada) is proposed. The method uses abiotic (non-living, physical and chemical attributes) as inputs to the model, since the physical mechanisms governing DO in the river are largely unknown. A new two-step method to construct fuzzy numbers using observations is proposed. Then an existing fuzzy neural network is modified to account for fuzzy number inputs and also uses possibility-theory based intervals to train the network. Results demonstrate that the method is particularly well suited to predict low DO events in the Bow River. Model output and a defuzzification technique is used to estimate the risk of low DO so that water resource managers can implement strategies to prevent the occurrence of low DO.","authors":["U. T.
