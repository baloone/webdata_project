Some relationships of finite-dimensional frame constructions with several well-known problems and results are noted, including the Thomson problem on minimizing energy of electric charges on a sphere, the finite-dimensional version of Naimark's theorem on representing tight frames as orthogonal projections of orthonormal bases, the problem of the existence of Hadamard matrices, the problem of the existence of Steiner systems, and the problem of calculating the maximum number of equiangular lines.","authors":["Yuri Farkov"],"meta":["January 2021"],"references":[]}
