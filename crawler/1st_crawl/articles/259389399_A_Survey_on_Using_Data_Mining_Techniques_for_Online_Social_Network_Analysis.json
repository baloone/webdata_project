{"id":"259389399_A_Survey_on_Using_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Online_Social_Network_Analysis","abstract":"In this paper we take into consideration the concepts of using algorithmic and data mining perspective of Online Social Networks (OSNs), with special emphasis on latest hot topics of research area. There are several factors which has made the study of OSNs gain enormous importance by researchers. Few such factors include the availability of huge amount of OSN data, the representation of OSN data as graphs, and so on. Analysis of data in OSNs also has a great prospective for researchers in a variety of disciplines. Hence this paper gives an idea about the key topics of using data mining in OSNs which will help the researchers to solve those challenges that still exist in mining OSNs.","authors":["Gypsy Nandi"],"meta":["November 2013"],"references":["277289291_Link_Prediction_Using_Supervised_Learning","271428755_Expertise_identification_using_email_communications","266346685_Challenges_in_developing_opinion_mining_tools_for_social_media","263377228_Hybrid_Recommender_Systems_Survey_and_Experiments","308953917_Amazon_com_recommendations_Item-to-item_collaborative_filtering","286170183_Measurement_Methods_of_User_Behavior_in_Online_Social_Networks","285100140_A_survey_of_opinion_mining_and_sentiment_analysis","263032777_Erratum_Community_detection_algorithms_A_comparative_analysis_Phys_Rev_E_80_056117_2009","262241105_Sentiment_analysis_in_Facebook_and_its_application_to_e-learning","260357584_PowerTrust_A_Robust_and_Scalable_Reputation_System_for_Trusted_Peer-to-Peer_Computing"]}
