If m is odd, then the conditions are the same except that the intervals (v, v + 1) are replaced by (). The main result is as follows: If a sequence (yv)(−∞ < v < ∞) of numbers is preassigned such that , then there exists a unique S(x) ϵSm satisfying the relations S(v) = yv, for all integer v, and the growth condition .","authors":["I.J Schoenberg"],"meta":["December 1972Journal of Approximation Theory 6(4):404-420","DOI:10.1016/0021-9045(72)90048-2"],"references":["268173470_Solution_of_Landau's_Problem_Concerning_Higher_Derivatives_on_the_Halfline","265323634_On_cardinal_perfect_splines_of_least_sup-norm_on_the_real_axis","242814538_Cardinal_interpolation_and_spline_functions1","242376322_Contributions_to_the_Problem_of_Approximation_of_Equidistant_Data_by_Analytic_Functions","235175582_On_Cardinal_Monosplines_of_Least_L_sub_infinity_-Norm_on_the_Real_Axis","235160564_Cardinal_Interpolation_and_Spline_Functions_IV_The_Exponential_Euler_Splines"]}
