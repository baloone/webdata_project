{"id":"287687058_Krylov-Subspace_Recycling_via_the_POD-Augmented_Conjugate-Gradient_Method","abstract":"This work presents a new Krylov-subspace-recycling method for efficiently solving sequences of linear systems of equations characterized by varying right-hand sides and symmetric-positive-definite matrices. As opposed to typical truncation strategies used in recycling such as deflation, we propose a truncation method inspired by goal-oriented proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) from model reduction. This idea is based on the observation that model reduction aims to compute a low-dimensional subspace that contains an accurate solution; as such, we expect the proposed method to generate a low-dimensional subspace that is well suited for computing solutions that can satisfy inexact tolerances. In particular, we propose specific goal-oriented POD `ingredients' that align the optimality properties of POD with the objective of Krylov-subspace recycling. To compute solutions in the resulting `augmented' POD subspace, we propose a hybrid direct/iterative three-stage method that leverages 1) the optimal ordering of POD basis vectors, and 2) well-conditioned reduced matrices. Numerical experiments performed on solid-mechanics problems highlight the benefits of the proposed method over existing approaches for Krylov-subspace recycling.","authors":["Kevin Carlberg","Virginia Forstall","Ray Tuminaro"],"meta":["December 2015SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications 37(3)","DOI:10.1137/16M1057693","SourcearXiv","Project: Data-driven numerical solvers"],"references":["312234881_Turbulence_and_the_dynamics_of_coherent_structures_I_Coherent_structures","262981832_Preserving_Lagrangian_structure_in_nonlinear_model_reduction_with_application_to_structural_dynamics","261437053_A_Compact_Proper_Orthogonal_Decomposition_Basis_for_Optimization-Oriented_Reduced-Order_Models","261436998_An_Adaptive_POD-Krylov_Reduced-Order_Model_for_Structural_Optimization","260003543_Preserving_Lagrangian_Structure_in_Nonlinear_Model_Reduction_with_Application_to_Structural_Dynamics","259362630_The_need_for_a_pressure-term_representation_in_empirical_Galerkin_models_of_incompressible_shear_flows","272374193_Direct_numerical_simulations_in_solid_mechanics_for_understanding_the_macroscale_effects_of_microscale_material_variability","266538172_10_Parallel_Implementation_of_a_Domain_Decomposition_Method_for_Non-Linear_Elasticity_Problems","266308470_Optimizing_substructuring_methods_for_repeated_right_hand_sides_scalable_parallel_coarse_solvers_and_globallocal_analysis","262212378_Relative_Perturbation_Techniques_for_Singular_Value_Problems"]}
