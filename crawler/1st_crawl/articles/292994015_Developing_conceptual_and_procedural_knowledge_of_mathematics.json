{"id":"292994015_Developing_conceptual_and_procedural_knowledge_of_mathematics","abstract":"When children practise solving problems, does this also enhance their understanding of the underlying concepts? Under what circumstances do abstract concepts help children invent or implement correct procedures? These questions tap a central research topic in the fields of cognitive development and educational psychology: the relations between conceptual and procedural knowledge. Delineating how these two types ofknowledge interact is fundamental to understanding how knowledge development occurs. lt is also central to improving instruction. Our goals of the current paper were: (1) discuss prominent definitions and measures of each type of knowledge, (2) review recent research on the developmental relations between\nconceptual and procedural knowledge for learning mathematics, (3) highlight promising research on potential methods for improving both types of knowledge, and (4) discuss problematic issues and future directions.","authors":["Bethany Rittle-Johnson","Michael Schneider"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199642342.013.014","In book: Oxford handbook of numerical cognition (pp.1102-1118)Chapter: 59Publisher: Oxford University PressEditors: Roi Cohen Kadosh, Ann Dowker","Projects: Cognitive processes in mathematics learningThe role of prior knowledge in learning"],"references":["289963945_Conceptual_and_procedural_knowledge_of_mathematics_Does_one_lead_to_the_other","289767207_Developing_conceptual_understanding_and_procedural_skill_in_mathematics_An_iterative_process","281345564_Expert_and_Novice_Performance_in_Solving_Physics_Problems","343613917_Syntax_and_Semantics_in_Learning_to_Subtract","316936258_Developing_conceptual_understanding_and_procedural_skill_in_mathematics_An_iterative_process","314799694_Preschool_children's_judgments_of_number_magnitude","289963297_The_development_of_adaptive_expertise_and_flexibility_The_integration_of_conceptual_and_procedural_knowledge","289308830_Examining_the_quality_of_statistical_mathematics_education_research","283150783_An_Alternative_Reconceptualization_of_Procedural_and_Conceptual_Knowledge","272580571_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Invention_and_Understanding_in_Children's_Multidigit_Addition_and_Subtraction","271402453_Assessment_of_a_Problem-Centered_Second-Grade_Mathematics_Project","264001979_Precis_of_Beyond_modularity_A_developmental_perspective_on_cognitive_science","263919164_It_Pays_to_be_Organized_Organizing_Arithmetic_Practice_Around_Equivalent_Values_Facilitates_Understanding_of_Math_Equivalence","271815199_Developing_Children's_Understanding_of_the_Rational_Numbers_A_New_Model_and_an_Experimental_Curriculum","270585133_Reconceptualizing_Procedural_Knowledge"]}
