{"id":"354330211_On_pairs_of_fuzzy_dominated_mappings_and_applications","abstract":"The main purpose of this paper is to present some fixed-point results for a pair of fuzzy dominated mappings which are generalized V -contractions in modular-like metric spaces. Some theorems using a partial order are discussed and also some useful results to graphic contractions for fuzzy-graph dominated mappings are developed. To explain the validity of our results, 2D and 3D graphs have been constructed. Also, applications are provided to show the novelty of our obtained results and their usage in engineering and computer science.","authors":["Tahair Rasham","Awais Asif","Hassen Aydi","Manuel De la Sen"],"meta":["September 2021Advances in Difference Equations 2021(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13662-021-03569-5"],"references":["352145842_Common_Fixed_Point_Theorems_in_M-Fuzzy_Cone_Metric_Space","351416531_On_a_pair_of_fuzzy_mappings_in_modular-like_metric_spaces_with_applications","351416526_Fixed_point_problems_for_generalized_contractions_with_applications","348581334_New_Generalizations_of_Set_Valued_Interpolative_Hardy-Rogers_Type_Contractions_in_b-Metric_Spaces","348435333_On_Orthogonal_Partial_-Metric_Spaces_with_an_Application","348433576_Existence_and_Uniqueness_Results_for_Two-Term_Nonlinear_Fractional_Differential_Equations_via_a_Fixed_Point_Technique","348002867_Exciting_Fixed_Point_Results_on_a_Novel_Space_with_Supportive_Applications","346996964_Multivalued_Fixed_Point_Results_for_Two_Families_of_Mappings_in_Modular-Like_Metric_Spaces_with_Applications","343170421_A_survey_F-contractions_with_related_fixed_point_results","342882361_A_mathematical_model_for_COVID-19_transmission_by_using_the_Caputo_fractional_derivative","341991858_F-contraction_mappings_on_metric-like_spaces_in_connection_with_integral_equations_on_time_scales","341719822_On_Best_Proximity_Point_Results_for_Some_Type_of_Mappings","340070588_Hybrid_Ciric_Type_Graphic_YL-Contraction_Mappings_with_Applications_to_Electric_Circuit_and_Fractional_Differential_Equations","339361010_Some_new_fixed_point_results_for_multi-valued_weakly_Picard_operators","339499067_A_new_study_on_the_mathematical_modelling_of_human_liver_with_Caputo-Fabrizio_fractional_derivative"]}
