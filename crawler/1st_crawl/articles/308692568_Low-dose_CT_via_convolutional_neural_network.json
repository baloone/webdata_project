{"id":"308692568_Low-dose_CT_via_convolutional_neural_network","abstract":"In order to reduce the potential radiation risk, low-dose CT has attracted more and more attention. However, simply lowering the radiation dose will significantly degrade the imaging quality. In this paper, we propose a noise reduction method for low-dose CT via deep learning without accessing the original projection data. An architecture of deep convolutional neural network was considered to map the low-dose CT images into its corresponding normal-dose CT images patch by patch. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate a state-the-art performance of the proposed method.","authors":["Hu Chen","Yi Zhang","Weihua Zhang","Peixi Liao"],"meta":["January 2017Biomedical Optics Express 8(2):679-694","DOI:10.1364/BOE.8.000679","Project: Machine learning for medical imaging"],"references":["309572978_WaveNet_a_deep_convolutional_neural_network_using_directional_wavelets_for_low-dose_X-ray_CT_reconstruction","307959794_Spectral_CT_Reconstruction_With_Image_Sparsity_and_Spectral_Mean","305735726_Image_Prediction_for_Limited-angle_Tomography_via_Deep_Learning_with_Convolutional_Neural_Network","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","311557611_Statistical_iterative_reconstruction_using_adaptive_fractional_order_regularization","310752071_Natural_image_denoising_with_convolutional_networks","308107275_A_Perspective_on_Deep_Imaging","304665464_Accelerating_magnetic_resonance_imaging_via_deep_learning","299402457_Urinary_bladder_segmentation_in_CT_urography_using_deep-learning_convolutional_neural_network_and_level_sets","297898200_Non-Local_Auto-Encoder_With_Collaborative_Stabilization_for_Image_Restoration"]}
