{"id":"351106128_On_the_Complexity_of_Broadcast_Domination_and_Multipacking_in_Digraphs","abstract":"We study the complexity of the two dual covering and packing distance-based problems Broadcast Domination and Multipacking in digraphs. A dominating broadcast of a digraph D is a function f:V(D)â†’N such that for each vertex v of D, there exists a vertex t with f(t)>0 having a directed path to v of length at most f(t). The cost of f is the sum of f(v) over all vertices v. A multipacking is a set S of vertices of D such that for each vertex v of D and for every integer d, there are at most d vertices from S within directed distance at most d from v. The maximum size of a multipacking of D is a lower bound to the minimum cost of a dominating broadcast of D. Let Broadcast Domination denote the problem of deciding whether a given digraph D has a dominating broadcast of cost at most k, and Multipacking the problem of deciding whether D has a multipacking of size at least k. It is known that Broadcast Domination is polynomial-time solvable for the class of all undirected graphs (that is, symmetric digraphs), while polynomial-time algorithms for Multipacking are known only for a few classes of undirected graphs. We prove that Broadcast Domination and Multipacking are both NP-complete for digraphs, even for planar layered acyclic digraphs of small maximum degree. Moreover, when parameterized by the solution cost/solution size, we show that the problems are respectively W[2]-hard and W[1]-hard. We also show that Broadcast Domination is FPT on acyclic digraphs, and that it does not admit a polynomial kernel for such inputs, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level. In addition, we show that both problems are FPT when parameterized by the solution cost/solution size together with the maximum (out-)degree, and as well, by the vertex cover number. Finally, we give for both problems polynomial-time algorithms for some subclasses of acyclic digraphs.","authors":["Florent Foucaud","Benjamin Gras","Anthony Perez","Florian Sikora"],"meta":["September 2021Algorithmica 83(9):1-27","DOI:10.1007/s00453-021-00828-5"],"references":["345888442_Width-Measures_for_Directed_Graphs_and_Algorithmic_Applications","341737301_On_the_Complexity_of_Broadcast_Domination_and_Multipacking_in_Digraphs","328347787_Broadcast_domination_and_multipacking_in_strongly_chordal_graphs","325430512_k_-broadcast_domination_and_k_-multipacking","323627176_Broadcast_domination_and_multipacking_bounds_and_the_integrality_gap","317633533_Deciding_First-Order_Properties_of_Nowhere_Dense_Graphs","316797733_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","313903170_Parameterized_Algorithms","286276456_Kernelization_Lower_Bounds_Through_Colors_and_IDs","274354170_Introduction_to_Combinatorial_Mathematics","257907679_New_bounds_for_the_broadcast_domination_number_of_a_graph","228543760_Broadcast_domination_algorithms_for_interval_graphs_series-parallel_graphs_and_trees","267000461_Sparsity_Graphs_Structures_and_Algorithms","265548566_Dominating_broadcasts_in_graphs","262115464_Broadcast_Domination_on_Block_Graphs_in_Linear_Time"]}
