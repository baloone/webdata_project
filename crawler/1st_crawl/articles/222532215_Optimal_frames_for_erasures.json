{"id":"222532215_Optimal_frames_for_erasures","abstract":"We study frames from the viewpoint of coding theory. We introduce a numerical measure of how well a frame reconstructs vectors when some of the frame coefficients of a vector are lost and then attempt to find and classify the frames that are optimal in this setting.","authors":["Roderick B Holmes","Vern Paulsen"],"meta":["January 2004Linear Algebra and its Applications 377(1):31-51","DOI:10.1016/j.laa.2003.07.012","Project: Frame theory"],"references":["280445306_Packing_Lines_Planes_etc_Packings_in_Grassmannian_Space","260542731_Quantized_overcomplete_expansions_in_IRN_Analysis_synthesis_and_algorithms","248368758_Wandering_vectors_for_unitary_systems_and_orthogonal_wavelets","269407580_Sphere_Packing_Lattices_and_Groups","267481122_The_equivalence_of_frames","255614882_Quantized_Frame_Expansions_with_Erasures_1","248538994_A_Paley-Wiener_Theorem_for_Frames","244250868_Frames_Bases_and_Group_Representations","243773342_A_Survey_of_Two-Graphs","243066264_Portraits_of_Frames"]}
