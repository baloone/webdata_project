{"id":"1955341_HTTP_Cookies_Standards_privacy_and_politics","abstract":"How did we get from a world where cookies were something you ate and where \"non-techies\" were unaware of \"Netscape cookies\" to a world where cookies are a hot-button privacy issue for many computer users? This paper will describe how HTTP \"cookies\" work, and how Netscape's original specification evolved into an IETF Proposed Standard. I will also offer a personal perspective on how what began as a straightforward technical specification turned into a political flashpoint when it tried to address non-technical issues such as privacy.","authors":["David M.
