{"id":"293015480_Broken_triangles_From_value_merging_to_a_tractable_class_of_general-arity_constraint_satisfaction_problems","abstract":"A binary CSP instance satisfying the broken-triangle property (BTP)\ncan be solved in polynomial time. Unfortunately, in practice, few\ninstances satisfy the BTP. We show that a local version of the BTP\nallows the merging of domain values in arbitrary instances of binary\nCSP, thus providing a novel polynomial-time reduction operation.\nExtensive experimental trials on benchmark instances demonstrate a\nsignificant decrease in instance size for certain classes of\nproblems. We show that BTP-merging can be generalised to instances\nwith constraints of arbitrary arity and we investigate the\ntheoretical relationship with resolution in SAT. A directional\nversion of general-arity BTP-merging then allows us to extend the BTP\ntractable class previously defined only for binary CSP.\nWe investigate the complexity of several related problems including\nthe recognition problem for the general-arity BTP class when the variable order\nis unknown, finding an optimal order in which to apply BTP merges and\ndetecting BTP-merges in the presence of global constraints such as AllDifferent.","authors":["Martin Cooper","Aymeric Duchein","Achref El Mouelhi","Guillaume Escamocher"],"meta":["February 2016Artificial Intelligence 234(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2016.02.001"],"references":["300350046_Broken_Triangles_Revisited","281886829_Beyond_Consistency_and_Substitutability","281627188_A_Microstructure-Based_Family_of_Tractable_Classes_for_CSPs","280534345_On_Tree-Preserving_Constraints","277557390_On_Broken_Triangles","277250213_A_Hybrid_Tractable_Class_for_Non-Binary_CSPs","273918449_Characterising_the_Complexity_of_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems_Defined_by_2-Constraint_Forbidden_Patterns","272020870_The_Extendable-Triple_Property_a_new_CSP_Tractable_Class_beyond_BTP","268214083_Hidden_Tractable_Classes_From_Theory_to_Practice","263729979_Unifying_and_extending_hybrid_tractable_classes_of_CSPs","260704178_Eliminating_Redundancy_in_CSPs_Through_Merging_and_Subsumption_of_Domain_Values","259875151_Tractable_Triangles_and_Cross-Free_Convexity_in_Discrete_Optimisation","250710760_The_Complexity_of_Constraint_Languages","247779031_Global_constraints","221632806_Perfect_Constraints_Are_Tractable","220944383_Effective_Preprocessing_in_SAT_Through_Variable_and_Clause_Elimination","220937293_Refining_the_Basic_Constraint_Propagation_Algorithm","220838185_Boosting_Systematic_Search_by_Weighting_Constraints","51889184_Hybrid_Tractable_Classes_of_Binary_Quantified_Constraint_SatisfactionProblems","50305858_The_Tractability_of_CSP_Classes_Defined_by_Forbidden_Patterns","321615632_Principles_and_Practice_of_Constraint_Programming_20th_International_Conference_CP_2014_Lyon_France_September_8-12_2014_Proceedings","272194163_Variable_and_Value_Elimination_in_Binary_Constraint_Satisfaction_via_Forbidden_Patterns","239279979_Complexity_of_Constraints_-_An_Overview_of_Current_Research_Themes_Result_of_a_Dagstuhl_Seminar","236611346_The_Complexity_of_Constraint_Languages","222561034_Generalizing_constraint_satisfaction_on_trees_Hybrid_tractability_and_variable_elimination","221603492_Eliminating_Interchangeable_Values_in_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220546620_Fundamental_Properties_of_Neighbourhood_Substitution_in_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220431888_The_complexity_of_homomorphism_and_constraint_satisfaction_problems_seen_from_the_other_side","220269309_Decomposition_of_Domains_Based_on_the_Micro-Structure_of_Finite_Constraint-Satisfaction_Problems","47842514_Simultaneous_matchings_Hardness_and_approximation","45882402_Tractable_Hypergraph_Properties_for_Constraint_Satisfaction_and_Conjunctive_Queries","2821111_Contradicting_Conventional_Wisdom_in_Constraint_Satisfaction"]}
