{"id":"321121592_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_Based_on_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_and_Distance_Density","abstract":"In this letter, a band-selection approach based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and distance density (DD) is proposed. This method effectively mitigates the curse of dimensionality for hyperspectral images (HSIs). First, we use the hyperspectral full-band data to train a custom 1-D CNN to obtain a well-trained model. Second, we select band combinations based on DD. Using the rectified linear unit, which is the activation function of the CNN that is only activated with a nonzero value, we can effectively test the band combinations without retraining the model. Finally, the method selects the band combinations with the highest precision as the final selected bands. This precision measure is a new criterion for band selection. To further improve the performance, a data augmentation method based on DD is also proposed. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on two HSIs. The results show that the proposed method can acquire more satisfactory results than traditional methods.","authors":["Ying Zhan","Dan Hu","Haihua Xing","Xianchuan Yu"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters PP(99):1-5","DOI:10.1109/LGRS.2017.2765339"],"references":["312101330_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_From_Statistical_Wavelet_Models","306244987_A_Self-Improving_Convolution_Neural_Network_for_the_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Data","301734617_A_discriminant_sparse_representation_graph-based_semi-supervised_learning_for_hyperspectral_image_classification","321793107_A_new_hyperspectral_band_selection_approach_based_on_convolutional_neural_network","316260466_Discriminative_Sparse_Representation_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_A_Semi-Supervised_Perspective","312668868_Sparse_Hilbert_Schmidt_Independence_Criterion_and_Surrogate-Kernel-Based_Feature_Selection_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","305459278_Deep_Feature_Extraction_and_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images_Based_on_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","303847364_Deep_Learning_for_Remote_Sensing_Data_A_Technical_Tutorial_on_the_State_of_the_Art","303821580_Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","290523094_Automatic_Band_Selection_Using_Spatial-Structure_Information_and_Classifier-Based_Clustering"]}
