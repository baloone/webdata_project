{"id":"315595675_A_multiple_ship_routing_and_speed_optimization_problem_under_time_cost_and_environmental_objectives","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate a multiple ship routing and speed optimization problem under time, cost and environmental objectives. A branch and price algorithm as well as a constraint programming model are developed that consider (a) fuel consumption as a function of payload, (b) fuel price as an explicit input, (c) freight rate as an input, and (d) in-transit cargo inventory costs. The alternative objective functions are minimum total trip duration, minimum total cost and minimum emissions. Computational experience with the algorithm is reported on a variety of scenarios.","authors":["Min Wen","Dario Pacino","Christos A Kontovas","Harilaos N Psaraftis"],"meta":["May 2017Transportation Research Part D Transport and Environment 52:303-321","DOI:10.1016/j.trd.2017.03.009","Project: Green maritime logistics"],"references":["257941703_A_Base_Integer_Programming_Model_and_Benchmark_Suite_for_Liner-Shipping_Network_Design","221704743_A_New_Optimization_Algorithm_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","220669157_A_Computational_Study_of_Search_Strategies_for_Mixed_Integer_Programming","283284863_Full-Shipload_Tramp_Ship_Routing_and_Scheduling_with_Variable_Speeds","282466850_Joint_Planning_of_Fleet_Deployment_Speed_Optimization_and_Cargo_Allocation_for_Liner_Shipping","280224034_Deterministic_Minimal_Time_Vessel_Routing","279270164_Disruption_Recovery_for_a_Vessel_in_Liner_Shipping","273876766_The_economic_speed_of_an_oceangoing_vessel_in_a_dynamic_setting","272523197_Real-time_risk_of_ship_structures_integrating_structural_health_monitoring_data_Application_to_multi-objective_optimal_ship_routing","272419984_Modeling_the_Impacts_of_Tides_and_the_Virtual_Arrival_Policy_in_Berth_Allocation","272198813_Maritime_routing_and_speed_optimization_with_emission_control_areas","271614903_Speed_models_for_energy-efficient_maritime_transportation_A_taxonomy_and_survey","264681414_Analysis_of_an_exact_algorithm_for_the_vessel_speed_optimization_problem","262042311_Bulk_ship_routing_and_scheduling_Solving_practical_problems_may_provide_better_results","262003981_Bulk_ship_routing_and_scheduling_Solving_practical_problems_may_provide_better_results","261715335_Ship_speed_optimization_Concepts_models_and_combined_speed-routing_scenarios","261327407_Integrated_maritime_fleet_deployment_and_speed_optimization_Case_study_from_RoRo_shipping","260013070_Effect_of_a_speed_reduction_of_containerships_in_response_to_higher_energy_costs_in_Sulphur_Emission_Control_Areas","251670262_The_effectiveness_of_a_European_speed_limit_versus_an_international_bunker-levy_to_reduce_CO_2_emissions_from_container_shipping","242932205_Deterministic_Minimal_Time_Vessel_Routing","241885239_Branch_and_Price_for_the_Time-Dependent_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","239386006_The_Effect_of_Oil_Price_on_the_Optimal_Speed_of_Ships","233130776_Fleet_deployment_optimization_for_liner_shipping_Part_1_Background_problem_formulation_and_solution_approaches","229093659_Tramp_ship_routing_and_scheduling_with_speed_optimization","222692510_The_effect_of_high_fuel_costs_on_liner_service_configuration_in_container_shipping"]}
