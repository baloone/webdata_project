{"id":"323777417_Structure_of_the_phytoplanktonic_community_in_a_neotropical_Dam_with_environmental_tension","abstract":"The Betania Dam is a strategic ecosystem of the department of Huila in Colombia, which goods and services include the generation of hydroelectric energy and the production of red tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) and silver tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in intensive systems. These activities generate conditions in the flow of matter and energy through the introduction of nutrients and foreign species that cause responses in the hydrobiological communities. In this research, zooplankton samples collected every two months for eighteen months were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively at three sampling stations of the reservoir corresponding to three hydro morphological zones to determine the species present in the reservoir and the relative abundance of each one in this period.\nBiological diversity indexes, Kruskal Wallis tests were applied and oxygen and pH profiles were obtained throughout the day. Seven new zooplankton records were found for the reservoir. In addition, temporal variations were observed in the abundance of the species and some relationships between nutrient availability and climatic conditions were discussed with the diversity and abundance patterns of zooplankton where some of them reflect the typical behavior of a eutrophic system.","authors":["Paula Martínez Silva","Jorge Leonardo Muñoz Yustres","Luis Carvajal","Ruthber Rodriguez"],"meta":["January 2018Contemporary Engineering Sciences 11(10):451-465","DOI:10.12988/ces.2018.8233","Project: Structure of the Phytoplankton community in Betania - Huila"],"references":["324091535_Electrogenic_Biodegradation_Study_of_the_Carbofuran_Insecticide_in_Soil","323774041_Removal_of_chromium_in_wastewater_from_tanneries_applying_bioremediation_with_algae_orange_peels_and_citrus_pectin","323550440_Didactic_Mathematical_Developments_Applied_to_the_Learning_of_Classic_Passive_Filters","323550245_Direct_and_Inverse_Kinematics_of_a_Manipulator_Robot_of_Five_Degrees_of_Freedom_Implemented_in_Embedded_System-CompactRIO","323550200_Applications_Alternatives_of_Multivariable_Control_in_the_Tower_Distillation_and_Evaporation_Plant","323395155_Kinematic_model_of_the_scorbot_4PC_manipulator_implemented_in_Matlab's_Guide","322926365_Extraction_in_Laboratory_of_Heavy_Metals_Through_Rhizofiltration_using_the_Plant_Zea_Mays_maize","321913209_Design_of_a_gas_sensor_based_on_the_concept_of_digital_interconnection_IoT_for_the_emergency_broadcast_system","318600784_Natural_Reserves_of_Civil_Society_as_Strategic_Ecosystems_Case_Study_Meremberg","321425673_Zur_Vervollkommnung_der_quantitativen_Phytoplankton-Methodik_Mit_1_Tabelle_und_15_abbildungen_im_Text_und_auf_1_Tafel"]}
