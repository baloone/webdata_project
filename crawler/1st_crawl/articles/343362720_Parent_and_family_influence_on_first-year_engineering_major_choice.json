{"id":"343362720_Parent_and_family_influence_on_first-year_engineering_major_choice","abstract":"The choice of a career or profession is a developmental process [1] that is influenced by a diverse set of factors including familial influences [1-12]. Parental career path [5] and perception of other career fields [6] have been shown to influence student career choice. The research presented in this paper focuses on the links between parental and other family membersâ€™ engineering or STEM occupations and engineering major choice, as well as whether this effect has any differences by gender. In this study, 158 first year engineering students from a public midwestern technical university were surveyed to determine major, deciding factors in major selection, as well as if any family member or mentor had a career in an engineering discipline or STEM fields. This research determined that 63% of the students surveyed had at least one family member that had a career in engineering. Differences in the parental careers of male and female students will also be discussed in the paper.","authors":["Michelle Jarvie-Eggart","Amanda Marie Singer","Jason Mathews"],"meta":["January 2020"],"references":["345937514_Does_Major_Matter_A_Look_At_What_Motivates_Engineering_Students_In_Different_Majors","345929461_It_Kind_Of_Chose_Me_Agency_And_Influence_In_Women's_Decision_To_Major_In_Engineering","344835556_Expanding_Your_Horizons_The_Impact_of_a_One-day_STEM_Conference_on_Middle_School_Girls'_and_Parents'_Attitude_Toward_STEM_Careers","344797663_Factors_Influencing_the_Interest_Levels_of_Male_versus_Female_Students_going_into_STEM_Fields_Evaluation","344792429_Influences_of_FemaleWomen_Engineering_Professionals_at_the_Workplace_Home_and_Community","344545252_Parents_as_Critical_Influence_Insights_from_Five_Different_Studies","344545054_Factors_influencing_students'_choice_of_engineering_major","344538571_Engineering_Childhood_Knowledge_Transmission_Through_Parenting","344533176_Factors_Influencing_High_School_Students'_to_Pursue_an_Engineering_Baccalaureate","344528635_Do_Engineers_Beget_Engineers_Exploring_Connections_Between_the_Engineering-related_Career_Choices_of_Students_and_Their_Families"]}
