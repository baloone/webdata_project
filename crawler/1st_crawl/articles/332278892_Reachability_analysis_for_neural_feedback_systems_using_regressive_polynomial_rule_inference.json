{"id":"332278892_Reachability_analysis_for_neural_feedback_systems_using_regressive_polynomial_rule_inference","abstract":"We present an approach to construct reachable set overapproximations for continuous-time dynamical systems controlled using neural network feedback systems. Feedforward deep neural networks are now widely used as a means for learning control laws through techniques such as reinforcement learning and data-driven predictive control. However, the learning algorithms for these networks do not guarantee correctness properties on the resulting closed-loop systems. Our approach seeks to construct overapproximate reachable sets by integrating a Taylor model-based flowpipe construction scheme for continuous differential equations with an approach that replaces the neural network feedback law for a small subset of inputs by a polynomial mapping. We generate the polynomial mapping using regression from input-output samples. To ensure soundness, we rigorously quantify the gap between the output of the network and that of the polynomial model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over a suite of benchmark examples ranging from 2 to 17 state variables, comparing our approach with alternative ideas based on range analysis.","authors":["Souradeep Dutta","Xin Chen","Sriram Sankaranarayanan"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1145/3302504.3311807","Conference: the 22nd ACM International Conference"],"references":["327084650_Reachable_Set_Estimation_and_Safety_Verification_for_Piecewise_Linear_Systems_with_Neural_Network_Controllers","323302444_Reachable_Set_Estimation_and_Safety_Verification_for_Piecewise_Linear_Systems_with_Neural_Network_Controllers","322048764_Reachable_Set_Computation_and_Safety_Verification_for_Neural_Networks_with_ReLU_Activations","320492610_A_Linear_Programming-based_Iterative_Approach_to_Stabilizing_Polynomial_Dynamics","319101461_Output_Reachable_Set_Estimation_and_Verification_for_Multi-Layer_Neural_Networks","318370372_Safety_Verification_of_Deep_Neural_Networks","316911609_Safety_Verification_of_Deep_Neural_Networks","313394663_Reluplex_An_Efficient_SMT_Solver_for_Verifying_Deep_Neural_Networks","312117029_Neural_Network_Guidance_for_UAVs","303657108_TensorFlow_A_system_for_large-scale_machine_learning","303486514_Measuring_Neural_Net_Robustness_with_Constraints","295351374_C2E2_A_Verification_Tool_for_Stateflow_Models","283567778_An_Introduction_to_CORA_2015","264187923_Control_Lyapunov_Function_Design_by_Cancelling_Input_Singularity","247699712_Taylor_models_and_other_validated_functional_inclusion_methods","236943114_Challenging_SMT_solvers_to_verify_neural_networks","221403485_An_Abstraction-Refinement_Approach_to_Verification_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks","221402943_SpaceEx_Scalable_Verification_of_Hybrid_Systems","29621282_Reachability_in_Linear_Dynamical_Systems","26405962_Lyapunov_analysis_of_sliding_motions_Application_to_bounded_control","327354048_Learning_and_Verification_of_Feedback_Control_Systems_using_Feedforward_Neural_Networks","323687221_Output_Range_Analysis_for_Deep_Feedforward_Neural_Networks","320037488_Formal_Verification_of_Piece-Wise_Linear_Feed-Forward_Neural_Networks","318692739_PLATO_Policy_learning_using_adaptive_trajectory_optimization","317820650_An_approach_to_reachability_analysis_for_feed-forward_ReLU_neural_networks","316895789_HyLAA_A_Tool_for_Computing_Simulation-Equivalent_Reachability_for_Linear_Systems","316662454_Formal_Verification_of_Piece-Wise_Linear_Feed-Forward_Neural_Networks","312184617_Decomposed_Reachability_Analysis_for_Nonlinear_Systems","301972004_dReach_d-Reachability_Analysis_for_Hybrid_Systems","262167988_Flow_An_Analyzer_for_Non-linear_Hybrid_Systems","261333080_Taylor_Model_Flowpipe_Construction_for_Non-linear_Hybrid_Systems","239536213_Foundations_Of_Multidimensional_And_Metric_Data_Structures","220694961_Introduction_to_Interval_Analysis","220252838_Verified_Integration_of_ODEs_and_Flows_Using_Differential_Algebraic_Methods_on_High-Order_Taylor_Models","220252776_Motivations_for_an_Arbitrary_Precision_Interval_Arithmetic_and_the_MPFI_Library","11042144_Extracting_regression_rules_from_neural_networks","5602159_Neuro-fuzzy_rule_generation_Survey_in_soft_computing_framework","5602115_Extracting_rules_from_trained_neural_networks","5596000_Reinforcement_Learning_An_Introduction","3331877_TORA_example_Cascade-_and_passivity-based_control_designs","3206282_A_Tool_Box_for_Approximate_Linearization_of_Nonlinear_Systems","3114406_Rule_generation_from_neural_networks","2657068_The_Wrapping_Effect_Ellipsoid_Arithmetic_Stability_and_Confidence_Regions","2245394_Self-Validated_Numerical_Methods_and_Applications"]}
