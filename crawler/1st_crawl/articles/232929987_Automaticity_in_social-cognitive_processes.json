{"id":"232929987_Automaticity_in_social-cognitive_processes","abstract":"Over the past several years, the concept of automaticity of higher cognitive processes has permeated nearly all domains of psychological research. In this review, we highlight insights arising from studies in decision-making, moral judgments, close relationships, emotional processes, face perception and social judgment, motivation and goal pursuit, conformity and behavioral contagion, embodied cognition, and the emergence of higher-level automatic processes in early childhood. Taken together, recent work in these domains demonstrates that automaticity does not result exclusively from a process of skill acquisition (in which a process always begins as a conscious and deliberate one, becoming capable of automatic operation only with frequent use) - there are evolved substrates and early childhood learning mechanisms involved as well.","authors":["John A Bargh","Kay L Schwader","Sarah E Hailey","Rebecca Dyer"],"meta":["November 2012Trends in Cognitive Sciences 16(12)","DOI:10.1016/j.tics.2012.10.002","SourcePubMed"],"references":["321418281_Stalking_the_perfect_measure_of_implicit_self-esteem_The_blind_men_and_the_elephant_revisited","324365629_Metaphors_We_Live_by","317595773_First_Impressions_From_Faces","314546184_Social_attitudes_modulate_automatic_imitation","313474064_Narcissism_beyond_Gestalt_and_awareness_The_name_letter_effect","313064006_The_selfish_goal","312470857_Bypassing_the_will_Toward_demystifying_the_nonconscious_control_of_social_behavior","305454340_From_oral_to_moral","303065535_Harvesting_implicit_group_attitudes_and_beliefs_from_a_demonstration_website","286717833_Implicit_social_cognition_and_indirect_measures_in_consumer_behavior"]}
