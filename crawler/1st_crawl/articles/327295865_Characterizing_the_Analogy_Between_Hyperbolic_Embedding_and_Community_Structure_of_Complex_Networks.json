{"id":"327295865_Characterizing_the_Analogy_Between_Hyperbolic_Embedding_and_Community_Structure_of_Complex_Networks","abstract":"We show that the community structure of a network can be used as a coarse version of its embedding in a hidden space with hyperbolic geometry. The finding emerges from a systematic analysis of several real-world and synthetic networks. We take advantage of the analogy for reinterpreting results originally obtained through network hyperbolic embedding in terms of community structure only. First, we show that the robustness of a multiplex network can be controlled by tuning the correlation between the community structures across different layers. Second, we deploy an efficient greedy protocol for network navigability that makes use of routing tables based on community structure.","authors":["Ali Faqeeh","Saeed Osat","Filippo Radicchi"],"meta":["August 2018Physical Review Letters 121(9)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.098301"],"references":["321169172_Machine_learning_meets_complex_networks_via_coalescent_embedding_in_the_hyperbolic_space","318813796_Soft_Communities_in_Similarity_Space","318670936_A_nonuniform_popularity-similarity_optimization_nPSO_model_to_efficiently_generate_realistic_complex_networks_with_communities","318222655_Optimal_percolation_on_multiplex_networks","317300096_Multiscale_unfolding_of_real_networks_by_geometric_renormalization","317230392_Bayesian_stochastic_blockmodeling","313465896_Emergent_Hyperbolic_Network_Geometry","321095675_Decoding_communities_in_networks","313481009_Geometric_Correlations_Mitigate_the_Extreme_Vulnerability_of_Multiplex_Networks_against_Targeted_Attacks","310741352_Equivalence_between_modularity_optimization_and_maximum_likelihood_methods_for_community_detection"]}
