{"id":"304553032_Generalized_controllers_for_rigid_formation_stabilization_with_application_to_event-based_controller_design","abstract":"This paper discusses generalized controllers for rigid formation shape stabilization. We provide unified analysis to show convergence using different controllers reported in the literature, and further prove an exponential stability of the formation system when using the general form of shape controllers. We also show that different agents can use different controllers for controlling different distances to achieve a desired rigid formation, which enables the implementation of heterogeneous agents in practice for formation shape control. We further propose an event-triggered rigid formation control scheme based on the generalized controllers. The triggering condition, event function and convergence analysis are discussed.","authors":["Zhiyong Sun","Qingchen Liu","C. Yu","B. D. O.
