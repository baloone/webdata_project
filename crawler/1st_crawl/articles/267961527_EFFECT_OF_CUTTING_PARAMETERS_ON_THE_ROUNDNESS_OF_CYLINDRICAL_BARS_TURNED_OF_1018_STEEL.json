{"id":"267961527_EFFECT_OF_CUTTING_PARAMETERS_ON_THE_ROUNDNESS_OF_CYLINDRICAL_BARS_TURNED_OF_1018_STEEL","abstract":"The purpose of this work was to analyze the effect of cutting parameters on the roundness of cylindrical parts for 1018 steel in the turning operation. An experimental Design by Response Surface Methodology was done in this work, the control variables were: cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cutting. Metal cutting experiments and statistical tests demonstrated that the Cutting Speed significantly affects the roundness of cylindrical part. Also, the interactions cutting speed –Feed Rate and Cutting Speed –Depth of Cutting affect the roundness of work piece too. Additionally, the experimental design was optimized by minimized the roundness; finally, further research directions are presented.","authors":["L Rico","A Naranjo","Salvador A.
