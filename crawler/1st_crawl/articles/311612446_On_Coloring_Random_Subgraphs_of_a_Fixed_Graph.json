{"id":"311612446_On_Coloring_Random_Subgraphs_of_a_Fixed_Graph","abstract":"Given a graph $G$ we study the chromatic number of a random graph $G_{1/2}$ obtained from $G$ by removing each edge of $G$ independently with probability $1/2$. Studying $\\chi(G_{1/2})$ has been suggested by Bukh, who asked whether $E[\\chi(G_{1/2})] \\geq \\Omega( \\chi(G)/\\log(\\chi(G)))$ holds for all graphs $G$. In this paper we prove several results related this problem. Denoting the chromatic number of $G$ by $k = \\chi(G)$ we prove the following results. 1. For all $d \\leq k^{1/3}$ it holds that $\\Pr[\\chi(G_{1/2}) \\leq d] < \\exp \\left(- \\Omega\\left(\\frac{k(k-d^3)}{d^3}\\right)\\right)$. In particular, $\\Pr[G_{1/2} \\text{ is bipartite}] < \\exp \\left(- \\Omega \\left(k^2 \\right)\\right)$. When $G$ is the $k$-clique, this bound is tight up to a constant in $\\Omega(\\cdot)$. 2. For all $\\epsilon > 0$ it holds that $\\Pr[\\chi(G_{1/2}) \\leq (1-\\epsilon)\\sqrt{k}] < \\exp \\left(- \\Omega\\left(\\epsilon^2\\sqrt{k}\\right)\\right)$. 3. If $\\alpha(G) \\leq O(n/k)$, then $E[\\chi(G_{1/2})] \\geq \\Omega \\left( k/\\log(k) \\right)$.","authors":["Igor Shinkar"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":["280912075_On_Percolation_and_NP-Hardness","225069664_On_the_Non-Planarity_of_a_Random_Subgraph","23936273_Choice-Memory_Tradeoff_in_Allocations","2110470_Random_subgraphs_of_finite_graphs_II_The_lace_expansion_and_the_triangle_condition","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","265708557_Hadwiger's_Conjecture_is_True_for_Almost_Every_Graph","239050940_The_shifting_technique_in_extremal_set_theory","228095998_Long_Paths_and_Cycles_in_Random_Subgraphs_of_Graphs_With_Large_Minimum_Degree","228057837_Homomorphiesatze_fur_Graphen_German","225791892_Lower_bound_of_the_Hadwiger_number_of_graphs_by_their_average_degree","221660866_The_Phase_Transition_in_Random_Graphs_A_Simple_Proof","220345601_The_Emergence_of_a_Giant_Component_in_Random_Subgraphs_of_Pseudo-Random_Graphs","38362521_On_Tail_Probabilities_for_Martingales","2110469_Random_subgraphs_of_finite_graphs_I_The_scaling_window_under_the_triangle_condition","2102997_Percolation_on_finite_graphs_and_isoperimetric_inequalities"]}
