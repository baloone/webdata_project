{"id":"330180894_Beneficial_Artificial_Intelligence_Coordination_by_Means_of_a_Value_Sensitive_Design_Approach","abstract":"This paper argues that the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) methodology provides a principled approach to embedding common values into AI systems both early and throughout the design process. To do so, it draws on an important case study: the evidence and final report of the UK Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence. This empirical investigation shows that the different and often disparate stakeholder groups that are implicated in AI design and use share some common values that can be used to further strengthen design coordination efforts. VSD is shown to be both able to distill these common values as well as provide a framework for stakeholder coordination.","authors":["Steven Umbrello"],"meta":["January 2019Big Data and Cognitive Computing 3(1):(5)","DOI:10.3390/bdcc3010005","Project: Emerging Technologies and Value-based design methodologies"],"references":["338834325_Health_at_any_Cost_Investigating_Ethical_Dimensions_and_Potential_Conflicts_of_an_Ambulatory_Therapeutic_Assistance_System_through_Value_Sensitive_Design","338834265_Exploring_Ethical_Design_Dimensions_of_a_Physiotherapeutic_mHealth_Solution_through_Value_Sensitive_Design","328420756_Title_A_values-based_approach_to_energy_controversies_Value-sensitive_design_applied_to_the_Groningen_gas_controversy_in_the_Netherlands","327101341_SAFE-FOR_WHO-BY-DESIGN_ADOPTING_A_POSTHUMANIST_ETHICS_FOR_TECHNOLOGY_DESIGN","327101164_Imaginative_Value_Sensitive_Design_How_Moral_Imagination_Exceeds_Moral_Law_Theories_in_Informing_Responsible_Innovation","348495575_A_Value-Sensitive_Design_Approach_to_Intelligent_Agents","343175304_Value-sensitive_Design","328458019_Value_Sensitive_Design_for_Autonomous_Vehicle_Motion_Planning","325582500_The_design_turn_in_applied_ethics","324413155_The_Role_of_Information_and_Communication_Technology_in_Self-Management_of_Chronic_Diseases_An_Empirical_Investigation_through_Value_Sensitive_Design"]}
