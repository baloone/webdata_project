{"id":"314091998_Supervised_Learning_of_Labeled_Pointcloud_Differences_via_Cover-Tree_Entropy_Reduction","abstract":"We introduce a new algorithm, called CDER, for supervised machine learning that merges the multi-scale geometric properties of Cover Trees with the information-theoretic properties of entropy. CDER applies to a training set of labeled pointclouds embedded in a common Euclidean space. If typical pointclouds corresponding to distinct labels tend to differ at any scale in any sub-region, CDER can identify these differences in (typically) linear time, creating a set of distributional coordinates which act as a feature extraction mechanism for supervised learning. We describe theoretical properties and implementation details of CDER, and illustrate its benefits on several synthetic examples.","authors":["Abraham Smith","Paul Bendich","John Harer","Jay Hineman"],"meta":["February 2017"],"references":["262805610_Topological_and_Statistical_Behavior_Classifiers_for_Tracking_Applications","228629885_Persistent_homology-a_survey","319897771_Geometry_Helps_to_Compare_Persistence_Diagrams","308805632_A_stable_multi-scale_kernel_for_topological_machine_learning","301269494_Geometry_Helps_to_Compare_Persistence_Diagrams","258819239_The_Ring_of_Algebraic_Functions_on_Persistence_Bar_Codes","247866275_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Springer","239727257_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","224839945_On_Information_and_Sufficiency","222091883_Linear-Size_Approximations_to_the_Vietoris-Rips_Filtration"]}
