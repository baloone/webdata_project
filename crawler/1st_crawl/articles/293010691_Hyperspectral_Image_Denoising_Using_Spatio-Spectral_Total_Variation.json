{"id":"293010691_Hyperspectral_Image_Denoising_Using_Spatio-Spectral_Total_Variation","abstract":"This letter introduces a hyperspectral denoising algorithm based on spatio-spectral total variation. The denoising problem has been formulated as a mixed noise reduction problem. A general noise model has been considered which accounts for not only Gaussian noise but also sparse noise. The inherent structure of hyperspectral images has been exploited by utilizing 2-D total variation along the spatial dimension and 1-D total variation along the spectral dimension. The denoising problem has been formulated as an optimization problem whose solution has been derived using the split-Bregman approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce a significant amount of noise from real noisy hyperspectral images. The proposed algorithm has been compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and the visual quality.","authors":["Hemant Kumar Aggarwal","Angshul Majumdar"],"meta":["February 2016IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters 13(3):1-5","DOI:10.1109/LGRS.2016.2518218"],"references":["264349092_Restoration_of_Images_Corrupted_by_Impulse_Noise_and_Mixed_Gaussian_Impulse_Noise_Using_Blind_Inpainting","260992374_Hyperspectral_Image_Restoration_Using_Low-Rank_Matrix_Recovery","258970424_Noise_Reduction_in_Hyperspectral_Images_Through_Spectral_Unmixing","258656438_Hyperspectral_Image_Denoising_Employing_a_Spectral-Spatial_Adaptive_Total_Variation_Model","254063231_Remote-Sensing_Image_Denoising_Using_Partial_Differential_Equations_and_Auxiliary_Images_as_Priors","233799234_A_Weighted_Dictionary_Learning_Model_for_Denoising_Images_Corrupted_by_Mixed_Noise","220124333_The_Split_Bregman_Method_for_L1-Regularized_Problems","3327793_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","3326758_Chan_TF_Color_TV_total_variation_methods_for_restoration_of_vector-valued_images_IEEE_Trans_Image_Process_7_304-309","308845729_Mixed_Gaussian_and_impulse_denoising_of_hyperspectral_images","260540891_Monochromatic_Noise_Removal_via_Sparsity-Enabled_Signal_Decomposition_Method","258656441_Denoising_of_Hyperspectral_Images_Using_the_PARAFAC_Model_and_Statistical_Performance_Analysis","254063233_Nonwhite_Noise_Reduction_in_Hyperspectral_Images","227180896_Solution_of_sparse_rectangular_systems_using_LSQR_and_CRAIG","224184454_Denoising_of_Hyperspectral_Imagery_Using_Principal_Component_Analysis_and_Wavelet_Shrinkage","224157727_Stable_Principal_Component_Pursuit","220600296_Restoration_of_images_corrupted_by_mixed_Gaussian-impulse_noise_via_l","220502909_An_EM_Algorthim_for_Wavelet-Besed_Image_Restoration"]}
