{"id":"342764055_Quantum_Overlapping_Tomography","abstract":"It is now experimentally possible to entangle thousands of qubits, and efficiently measure each qubit in parallel in a distinct basis. To fully characterize an unknown entangled state of n qubits, one requires an exponential number of measurements in n, which is experimentally unfeasible even for modest system sizes. By leveraging (i) that single-qubit measurements can be made in parallel, and (ii) the theory of perfect hash families, we show that all k-qubit reduced density matrices of an n qubit state can be determined with at most e O(k) log 2 (n) rounds of parallel measurements. We provide concrete measurement protocols which realize this bound. As an example, we argue that with current experiments, the entanglement between every pair of qubits in a system of 1000 qubits could be measured and completely characterized in a few days. This corresponds to completely characterizing entanglement of nearly half a million pairs of qubits.","authors":["Jordan Cotler","Andreas Christoforides","Frank Wilczek"],"meta":["July 2020Physical Review Letters 124(10)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.100401"],"references":["343333418_Hybrid_system_with_fuzzy_hierarchical_evaluation_model","343333364_Neuromorphic_computer_networks_with_synaptic_connections","343333292_Hyper--Dimensional_Neural_Network_Model_with_Desargues_Monoids","343333289_Quantum_factoring_of_a_number_with_6021_digits","343333288_Invertibility_of_Continuous-variable_quantum_neural_networks_based_on_the_Clifford_Subsets","343333200_Precision_modeling_of_applied_quantum_neural_networks","323400119_Neural-network_quantum_state_tomography","318898913_Observation_of_a_Many-Body_Dynamical_Phase_Transition_with_a_53-Qubit_Quantum_Simulator","331059132_Quantum_Entanglement_in_Deep_Learning_Architectures","325890001_Shadow_tomography_of_quantum_states"]}
