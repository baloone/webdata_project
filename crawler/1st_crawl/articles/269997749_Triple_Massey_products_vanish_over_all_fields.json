{"id":"269997749_Triple_Massey_products_vanish_over_all_fields","abstract":"We show that the absolute Galois group of any field has the vanishing triple\nMassey product property. Several corollaries for the structure of maximal\npro-$p$-quotient of absolute Galois groups are deduced. Furthermore, the\nvanishing of some higher Massey products is proved.","authors":["Jan Minac","Duy Tân Nguyêñ"],"meta":["December 2014Journal of the London Mathematical Society 94(3)","DOI:10.1112/jlms/jdw064","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269997990_Triple_Massey_products_and_absolute_Galois_groups","268451793_Triple_Massey_products_in_Galois_cohomology","266396637_Vanishing_of_Massey_Products_and_Brauer_Groups","316807238_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","308554988_Vanishing_ofMassey_products_and_Brauer_groups","297312360_ESSENTIAL_p-DIMENSION_OF_PGLp2","276881550_Produits_croises_Abeliens","270593922_Construction_of_unipotent_Galois_extensions_and_Massey_products","267149376_Cohomology_of_groups","266281699_Local_fields_Translated_from_the_French_by_Marvin_Jay_Greenberg"]}
