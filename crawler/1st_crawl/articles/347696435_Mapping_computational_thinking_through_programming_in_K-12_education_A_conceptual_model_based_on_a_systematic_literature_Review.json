{"id":"347696435_Mapping_computational_thinking_through_programming_in_K-12_education_A_conceptual_model_based_on_a_systematic_literature_Review","abstract":"Computational Thinking (CT) through programming attracts increased attention as it is considered an ideal medium for the development of 21st century skills. This intense attention leads to K-12 initiatives around the world and a rapid increase in relevant research studies. However, studies show challenges in CT research and educational practice. In addition, the domain has not been mapped to facilitate comprehensive understanding of the domain challenges and development of CT curricula. The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model based on a systematic literature review that maps the CT through programming in K-12 education domain. The proposed Computational Thinking through Programming in K-12 education (CTPK-12) conceptual model emerges from the synthesis of 101 studies and the identification of CT Areas. The proposed model consists of six CT Areas (namely Knowledge Base, Learning Strategies, Assessment, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building) and their relationships. The model could aid domain understanding and serve as a basis for future research studies. In addition, it could support the integration of CT into K-12 educational practices, providing evidence to educational stakeholders and researchers as well as bringing closer research, practice and policy.","authors":["Christina Tikva","Efthimios Tambouris"],"meta":["March 2021Computers & Education
