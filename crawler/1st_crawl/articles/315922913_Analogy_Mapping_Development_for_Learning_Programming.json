{"id":"315922913_Analogy_Mapping_Development_for_Learning_Programming","abstract":"Programming skill is an important skill for computer science students, whereas nowadays, there many computer science students are lack of skills and information technology knowledges in Indonesia. This is contrary with the implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) since the end of 2015 which is the qualified worker needed. This study provided an effort for nailing programming skills by mapping program code to visual analogies as learning media. The developed media was based on state machine and compiler principle and was implemented in C programming language. The state of every basic condition in programming were successful determined as analogy visualization.","authors":["Rosa Ariani Sukamto","Harsa Wara","Susanti Kurniawati"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Physics Conference Series 812(1):012109","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/812/1/012109"],"references":["265238852_51_Making_science_concepts_meaningful_to_students_teaching_with_analogies","247702027_Teaching_science_with_analogies_a_strategy_for_teachers_and_textbook_authors","242300416_REALIZATION_OF_THE_FINAL_STATE_MACHINE_WITH_CPLD_DEVICE","27473752_Metaphor_and_Analogy_in_Science_Education"]}
