{"id":"324055322_Distinct_stages_of_radio_frequency_emission_at_the_onset_of_pedestal_collapse_in_KSTAR_H-mode_plasmas","abstract":"Using a high-speed and broadband radio frequency (RF) (0.1-1 GHz) spectrum analyzer developed on the KSTAR tokamak, it is found that several distinct stages of RF emission appear at the pedestal collapse in high confinement discharges. Comparison with 2-D electron cyclotron emission (ECE) images has revealed that each stage is related to the instantaneous condition at the outboard mid-plane edge. First, high-harmonic ion cyclotron emissions (ICE) are intensified with the appearance of a non-modal filamentary perturbation in the edge within several tens of microseconds before the collapse. Then, the RF emission becomes broad toward high-frequency range (< 500 MHz) at the burst onset of the non-modal filament. During the pedestal collapse initiated by the filament burst, rapid chirping (1-3 {\\mu}s) appear with additional filament bursts. The strong correlation between the RF spectra and the perturbation structure provides important clues on the stability of edge-localized modes and on the ion dynamics in the plasma boundary.","authors":["Minho Kim","Shekar Goud Thatipamula","Jieun Lee","Minjun J Choi"],"meta":["March 2018Nuclear Fusion 58(9)","DOI:10.1088/1741-4326/aad05a","Project: Ion cyclotron harmonic emission in KSTAR tokamak"],"references":["319121813_The_effect_of_time-varying_flow-shear_on_the_nonlinear_stability_of_the_boundary_of_magnetized_toroidal_plasmas","315631129_Solitary_perturbations_in_the_steep_boundary_of_magnetized_toroidal_plasma","309438179_Prompt_loss_of_beam_ions_in_KSTAR_plasmas","267272171_Ion_cyclotron_emission_from_fusion-born_ions_in_large_tokamak_plasmas_A_brief_review_from_JET_and_TFTR_to_ITER","321638487_Observation_of_distorted_Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution_of_epithermal_ions_in_LHD","316842457_Quantifying_Fusion_Born_Ion_Populations_in_Magnetically_Confined_Plasmas_using_Ion_Cyclotron_Emission","306011213_Nonlinear_Interaction_of_Edge-Localized_Modes_and_Turbulent_Eddies_in_Toroidal_Plasma_under_n1_Magnetic_Perturbation","304404687_Ginzburg-Landau_Model_in_a_Finite_Shear-Layer_and_Onset_of_Transport_Barrier_Nonlinear_Oscillations_A_paradigm_for_Type-III_ELMs","301665767_Edge_localized_mode_rotation_and_the_nonlinear_dynamics_of_filaments","274259058_Pedestal_Bifurcation_and_Resonant_Field_Penetration_at_the_Threshold_of_Edge-Localized_Mode_Suppression_in_the_DIII-D_Tokamak"]}
