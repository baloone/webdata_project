{"id":"343513243_Circadian_clock_effects_on_cellular_proliferation_Insights_from_theory_and_experiments","abstract":"Oscillations of the cellular circadian clock have emerged as an important regulator of many physiological processes, both in health and in disease. One such process, cellular proliferation, is being increasingly recognized to be affected by the circadian clock. Here, we review how a combination of experimental and theoretical work has furthered our understanding of the way circadian clocks couple to the cell cycle and play a role in tissue homeostasis and cancer. Finally, we discuss recently introduced methods for modeling coupling of clocks based on techniques from survival analysis and machine learning and highlight their potential importance for future studies.","authors":["Shaon Chakrabarti","Franziska Michor"],"meta":["December 2020Current Opinion in Cell Biology 67:17-26","DOI:10.1016/j.ceb.2020.07.003"],"references":["338733843_Amplitude_Effects_Allow_Short_Jet_Lags_and_Large_Seasonal_Phase_Shifts_in_Minimal_Clock_Models","338513293_Development_of_the_Circadian_Core_Machinery_in_Mammals","337504901_Molecular_mechanisms_and_physiological_importance_of_circadian_rhythms","336919886_A_single-sample_circadian_biomarker_that_performs_across_populations_and_platforms","336326176_A_detailed_graphical_and_computational_model_of_the_mammalian_renal_circadian_clock","335434956_Targeting_Glioblastoma_Stem_Cells_through_Disruption_of_the_Circadian_Clock","339590910_Live-cell_imaging_of_circadian_clock_protein_dynamics_in_CRISPR-generated_knock-in_cells","336889159_Core_Concept_Emerging_science_of_chronotherapy_offers_big_opportunities_to_optimize_drug_delivery","335879403_Transcription-based_circadian_mechanism_controls_the_duration_of_molecular_clock_states_in_response_to_signaling_inputs","335751975_Robust_synchronization_of_the_cell_cycle_and_the_circadian_clock_through_bidirectional_coupling"]}
