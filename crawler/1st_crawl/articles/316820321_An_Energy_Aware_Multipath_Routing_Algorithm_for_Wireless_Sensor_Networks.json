{"id":"316820321_An_Energy_Aware_Multipath_Routing_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"p class=\"0abstract\"> Wireless sensor network is a new field of computer science and technology research. It has a very broad application prospects. In order to improve the network survival time, it is very important to design efficient energy-constrained routing protocols. In this paper, we studied the characteristics of wireless sensor networks, and analyzed the design criteria of sensor network routing algorithms. In view of the shortcomings of traditional algorithms, we proposed an energy-aware multi-path algorithm. When selecting a data transmission path, the energy-aware multi-path algorithm can avoid nodes with low energy levels. At the same time, it takes the remaining energy of the node and the number of hops as one of the measures of the path selection. The multi-path routing algorithm realized the low energy consumption of the data transmission path, thus effectively prolonging the network lifetime. Compared with the traditional algorithm, the results show that our method has high reliability and energy efficiency. </p","authors":["Liping LV"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Online Engineering (iJOE) 13(04):45","DOI:10.3991/ijoe.v13i04.7061"],"references":["306009892_Energy-Efficient_Hierarchical_Routing_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Swarm_Intelligence_Approach","304462274_P-SEP_A_prolong_stable_election_routing_algorithm_for_energy-limited_heterogeneous_fog-supported_wireless_sensor_networks","283184763_RFDMRP_River_Formation_Dynamics_based_Multi-hop_Routing_Protocol_for_Data_Collection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","281873280_Multi-hop_Routing_Algorithm_Using_Steiner_Points_for_Reducing_Energy_Consumption_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","307913899_Dynamic_time_and_spectrum_fragmentation-aware_service_provisioning_in_elastic_optical_networks_with_multi-path_routing","303808633_Channel-Aware_Routing_and_Priority-Aware_Multi-Channel_Scheduling_for_WSN-based_Smart_Grid_Applications","284156386_Improved_TEEN_Routing_Protocol_with_Multi_Hop_and_Multi_Path_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","274099831_An_Energy-Saving_Routing_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Body_Sensor_Network_using_Data_Compression_Technique","270913826_An_endocrine_cooperative_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_routing_recovery_problem_of_wireless_sensor_networks_with_multiple_mobile_sinks","266030368_Modelling_and_planning_reliable_wireless_sensor_networks_based_on_multi-objective_optimization_genetic_algorithm_with_changeable_length"]}
