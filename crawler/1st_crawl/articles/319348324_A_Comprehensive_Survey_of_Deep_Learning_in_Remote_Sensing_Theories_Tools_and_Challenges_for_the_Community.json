{"id":"319348324_A_Comprehensive_Survey_of_Deep_Learning_in_Remote_Sensing_Theories_Tools_and_Challenges_for_the_Community","abstract":"In recent years, Deep Learning (DL), a re-branding of neural networks (NNs), has risen to the top in numerous areas, namely Computer Vision (CV), speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Whereas remote sensing (RS) possesses a number of unique challenges, primarily related to sensors and applications, inevitably RS draws from many of the same theories as CV; e.g., statistics, fusion, and machine learning, to name a few. This means that the RS community should not only be aware of advancements like DL, but also be leading researchers in this area. Herein, we provide the most comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art RS DL research. We also review recent new developments in the DL field that can be used in DL for RS. Namely, we focus on theories, tools and challenges for the RS community. Specifically, we focus on unsolved challenges and opportunities as it relates to (i) inadequate data sets, (ii) human-understandable solutions for modelling physical phenomena, (iii) Big Data, (iv) non-traditional heterogeneous data sources, (v) DL architectures and learning algorithms for spectral, spatial and temporal data, (vi) transfer learning, (vii) an improved theoretical understanding of DL systems, (viii) high barriers to entry, and (ix) training and optimizing the DL.","authors":["John Ball","Derek Anderson","Chee Seng Chan"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Applied Remote Sensing
