{"id":"322181411_A_Review_of_the_Scopes_and_Challenges_of_the_Modern_Real-Time_Operating_Systems","abstract":"A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an integral part of a real-time embedded system (RTES). Most of the RTESs work on dynamic environments, and hence, the computational cost of tasks cannot be calculated in advance. Thus, RTOSs play a significant role in the smooth operations of the RTES through efficient task scheduling schemes and resource managements. This article investigates the existing design challenges and scope of the modern RTOSs. A wide variety of latest RTOSs are discussed and elaborated in detail. A comparative study with their prospects has been explained so that interested readers can use the article as a readily available starting point for their further studies on this topic.","authors":["Amit K.
