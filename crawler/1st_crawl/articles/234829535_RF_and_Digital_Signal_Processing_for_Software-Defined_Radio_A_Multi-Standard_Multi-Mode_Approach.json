{"id":"234829535_RF_and_Digital_Signal_Processing_for_Software-Defined_Radio_A_Multi-Standard_Multi-Mode_Approach","abstract":"Software-defined radio (SDR) is the hottest area of RF/wireless design, and this title describes SDR concepts, theory, and design principles from the perspective of the signal processing (both on transmission and reception) performed by a SDR system. After an introductory overview of essential SDR concepts, this book examines waveform creation, analog signal processing, digital signal processing, data conversion, phase-locked loops, SDR algorithms, and SDR hardware design. The various trade-offs at each of these design stages are discussed in detail. *Offers readers a powerful set of analytical and design tools*Details real world designs*Comprehensive coverage makes this a must have in the RF/Wireless industry","authors":["Tony Rouphael"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
