{"id":"349109834_Advanced_Image_Processing_Systems","abstract":"Image processing is a subset of digital signal processing that has different applications and benefits in different fields. Digital processing is in fact the digital image processing that can be performed with the help of computer science, programming and artificial intelligence. Image processing is one of the applications and subsets of artificial intelligence that, as its name suggests, processes digital images and displays a certain output with specific information based on predefined training. Nowadays, the applications of image processing technology in various fields in technical, industrial, scientific, security, medical, etc. have caused a lot of attention and use by different people. This paper presents the recent development and applications in the image processing systems in order to move forward the research filed by reviewing and analyzing recent achievements in the published papers. As a result, advanced image processing systems in different applications can be developed and new techniques in the image processing systems can be introduced.","authors":["Roza Dastres","Mohsen Soori"],"meta":["February 2021International Journal of Imaging and Robotics 21(1)"],"references":["344781801_Secure_Socket_Layer_SSL_in_the_Network_and_Web_Security","344604531_Impact_of_Meltdown_and_Spectre_on_CPU_Manufacture_Security_Issues","344437095_Pixel_matching_search_algorithm_for_counting_moving_vehicle_in_highway_traffic_videos","342757176_Automating_the_Formulation_and_Resolution_of_Convex_Variational_Problems_Applications_from_Image_Processing_to_Computational_Mechanics","342406413_Image-Processing-Based_Low-Cost_Fault_Detection_Solution_for_End-of-Line_ECUs_in_Automotive_Manufacturing","335132035_Face_Detection_Method_Based_on_Cascaded_Convolutional_Networks","335051252_Image_processing-based_intelligent_robotic_system_for_assistance_of_agricultural_crops","346130325_Facial_expression_recognition_using_human_machine_interaction_and_multi-modal_visualization_analysis_for_healthcare_applications","339555541_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Extreme_Learned_Image_Compression","329748419_Learning_Convolutional_Networks_for_Content-Weighted_Image_Compression"]}
