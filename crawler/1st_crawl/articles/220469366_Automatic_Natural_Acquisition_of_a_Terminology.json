{"id":"220469366_Automatic_Natural_Acquisition_of_a_Terminology","abstract":"The authors present the ANA system which is capable of automatically selecting the terminology from a technical domain by the analysis of free text. It uses statistical procedures and a few heuristics which have been inspired by the human learning of a mother tongue. Because the system does not need any syntactical or lexical resources, it is independent of the language (English, French, etc.) and of the level of discourse (technical, colloquial).","authors":["Chantal Enguehard","Laurent Pantera"],"meta":["January 1995Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 2(1):27-32","DOI:10.1080/09296179508590032","SourceDBLP"],"references":["313129348_The_acquisition_of_language_in_infant_and_child","220431230_The_String-to-String_Correction_Problem","31173864_Lexical_Co-occurrence_The_Missing_Link","2474035_Automatically_Extracting_And_Representing_Collocations_For_Language_Generation"]}
