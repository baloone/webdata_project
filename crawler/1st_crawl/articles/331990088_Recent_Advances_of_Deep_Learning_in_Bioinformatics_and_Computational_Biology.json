{"id":"331990088_Recent_Advances_of_Deep_Learning_in_Bioinformatics_and_Computational_Biology","abstract":"Extracting inherent valuable knowledge from omics big data remains as a daunting problem in bioinformatics and computational biology. Deep learning, as an emerging branch from machine learning, has exhibited unprecedented performance in quite a few applications from academia and industry. We highlight the difference and similarity in widely utilized models in deep learning studies, through discussing their basic structures, and reviewing diverse applications and disadvantages. We anticipate the work can serve as a meaningful perspective for further development of its theory, algorithm and application in bioinformatic and computational biology.","authors":["Binhua Tang","Zixiang Pan","Kang Yin","Asif Khateeb"],"meta":["March 2019Frontiers in Genetics 10:214","DOI:10.3389/fgene.2019.00214"],"references":["325604701_Transfer_learning_for_biomedical_named_entity_recognition_with_neural_networks","325344787_YAMDA_thousandfold_speedup_of_EM-based_motif_discovery_using_deep_learning_libraries_and_GPU","324240469_Opportunities_and_obstacles_for_deep_learning_in_biology_and_medicine","323796532_Development_and_Validation_of_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_for_Detection_of_Critical_Findings_in_Head_CT_Scans","323257074_3D_Regression_Neural_Network_for_the_Quantification_of_Enlarged_Perivascular_Spaces_in_Brain_MRI","328940074_DeepDiff_DEEP-learning_for_predicting_DIFFerential_gene_expression_from_histone_modifications","328241386_Deep_learning_algorithms_for_detection_of_critical_findings_in_head_CT_scans_a_retrospective_study","325622903_MRI_assessment_of_residual_breast_cancer_after_neoadjuvant_chemotherapy_relevance_to_tumor_subtypes_and_MRI_interpretation_threshold","325293669_Learning_Spatial-temporal_Features_for_Video_Copy_Detection_by_the_Combination_of_CNN_and_RNN","324997480_Combination_of_rs-fMRI_and_sMRI_Data_to_Discriminate_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_in_Young_Children_Using_Deep_Belief_Network"]}
