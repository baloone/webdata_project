{"id":"311474540_The_threshold_of_event_simultaneity","abstract":"We revisit the notion of event simultaneity in the context of parallel and distributed simulation. Although the simulation community has recognized this problem for years, it has focused mainly on the mechanics of breaking event-time ties and has neither measured its extent nor considered its implications. Exant simulators (both serial and parallel) prohibit simultaneity either by user-specified event priorities or by an arbitrary (but well-documented) tie-breaking mechanism. We show, theoretically and empirically, that these strategies may lead to an invalid simulation. In doing so, we introduce the threshold of event simultaneity and use it to understand the semantics of simultaneity.","authors":["Frederick Wieland"],"meta":["July 1997ACM SIGSIM Simulation Digest 27(1):56-59","DOI:10.1145/268823.268901"],"references":["242456784_Building_simulation_models_with_simscript_ii"]}
