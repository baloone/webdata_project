We describe the brief details of interaction among the bats and unknown hosts, then among the peoples and the infections reservoir (seafood market). The seafood marked are considered the main source of infection when the bats and the unknown hosts (may be wild animals) leaves the infection there. The purchasing of items from the seafood market by peoples have the ability to infect either asymptomatically or symptomatically. We reduced the model with the assumptions that the seafood market has enough source of infection that can be effective to infect people. We present the mathematical results of the model and then formulate a fractional model. We consider the available infection cases for January 21, 2020, till January 28, 2020 and parameterized the model. We compute the basic reproduction number for the data is R0â‰ˆ2.4829. The fractional model is then solved numerically by presenting many graphical results, which can be helpful for the infection minimization.","authors":["Muhammad Altaf Khan","Abdon Atangana"],"meta":["March 2020AEJ - Alexandria Engineering Journal 59(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.aej.2020.02.033"],"references":["338492975_Fractional_operator_method_on_a_multi-mutation_and_intrinsic_resistance_model","337389853_Modeling_the_mechanics_of_viral_kinetics_under_immune_control_during_primary_infection_of_HIV-1_with_treatment_in_fractional_order","336216035_Fractional_investigations_of_zoonotic_visceral_leishmaniasis_disease_with_singular_and_non-singular_kernel","334736013_The_dynamics_of_a_new_chaotic_system_through_the_Caputo-Fabrizio_and_Atanagan-Baleanu_fractional_operators","345425219_Mathematical_analysis_and_computational_experiments_for_an_epidemic_system_with_nonlocal_and_nonsingular_derivative","337345381_A_new_application_of_fractional_Atangana-Baleanu_derivatives_Designing_ABC-fractional_masks_in_image_processing","336183500_Modeling_and_simulation_of_nonlinear_dynamical_system_in_the_frame_of_nonlocal_and_non-singular_derivatives","335823160_A_fractional_order_model_for_Hepatitis_B_virus_with_treatment_via_Atangana-Baleanu_derivative","334638532_A_comparison_study_of_bank_data_in_fractional_calculus","334576386_Modeling_the_transmission_of_dengue_infection_through_fractional_derivatives"]}
