{"id":"308410310_Rightness_as_fairness_A_moral_and_political_theory","abstract":"Moral philosophy today is marked by profound, systematic disagreement. In Rightness as Fairness, Marcus Arvan argues that moral philosophy must adapt scientific principles of theory-selection in order to reliably uncover moral truth. Arvan then argues that our best empirical evidence and naturalistic observation reveal morality to be a type of prudence requiring us to act in ways that our present and future selves can rationally agree upon across time. Arvan shows that this agreement-Rightness as Fairness-requires us to be fair to ourselves and to others, including animals. Further, the Four Principles of Fairness comprising this agreement reconcile a variety of traditionally opposed moral and political frameworks.","authors":["Marcus Arvan"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1057/9781137541819","ISBN: 978-1-137-54180-2"],"references":["277619621_Intuition_and_Its_Place_in_Ethics","275596692_Kant's_Formula_of_Humanity","229842422_Resentment_and_Impartiality","227986821_An_Egalitarian_Law_of_Peoples"]}
