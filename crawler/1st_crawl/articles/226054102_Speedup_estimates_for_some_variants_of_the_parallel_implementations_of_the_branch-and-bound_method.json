A mathematical model of\nthe computation process is constructed and used to obtain estimates of the maximum possible speedup. Examples of problems\nin which none of these two parallel implementations can speed up the computations are considered.","authors":["Mikhail Posypkin","Israel Sigal"],"meta":["December 2006Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics 46(12):2187-2202","DOI:10.1134/S0965542506120165","Project: Large-scale high performance optimization"],"references":["326542724_LogP_towards_a_realistic_model_of_parallel_computation","239569305_Computational_efficiency_of_parallel_approximate_branch-and-bound_algorithms","290870257_Investigation_of_algorithms_for_parallel_computations_in_knapsack-type_discrete_optimization_problems","280820468_Parallel_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithms_Survey_and_Synthesis","265808191_Combinatorial_methods_and_algorithms_for_solving_problems_of_discrete_optimization_with_large_dimensionality","264917729_Parallel_methods_for_tree_traverse","243531039_Logp_analysis_of_parallel_branch_and_bound_communication","242932468_A_Queueing_Network_Model_for_Analyzing_a_Class_of_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithms_on_a_MasterSlave_Architecture","242920304_Graphs_and_Their_Use","238836727_Parallel_Branch-and-Branch_Algorithms_Survey_and_Synthesis"]}
