{"id":"304290829_Design_construction_and_control_of_hexapod_walking_robot","abstract":"This paper deals with design, construction and control of a hexapod (i.e. six-legged) walking robot. Basic characteristics of legged robots, a few existing robots and their pros and cons are described in the introduction of this paper. Next, basic gaits, which are used by legged robots for their locomotion are mentioned here. Main part of the paper is focused on the result of our project â€” on the six-legged robot, which can walk using tripod, wave and ripple gait and which is equipped with sonars, force-sensitive resistors and encoders. This robot is controlled and monitored from an user interface program, which can display data from the sensors and the positions of robot legs. The robot can be used to test and verify algorithms, gaits and features of hexapod walking robots.","authors":["Marek Zak","Jaroslav Rozman"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1109/Informatics.2015.7377851","Conference: 2015 IEEE 13th International Scientific Conference on Informatics"],"references":["263254476_Design_Issues_for_Hexapod_Walking_Robots","244120245_Stable_Stair_Climbing_in_a_Simple_Hexapod_Robot","221907923_Locomotion_Analysis_of_Hexapod_Robot","252057055_Hexapod_robot_Mathematical_support_for_modeling_and_control","239951690_Dynamic_Locomotion_with_a_Hexapod_Robot","37441265_Introduction_to_Autonomous_Mobile_Robots"]}
