{"id":"310495642_Situative_Educational_Model_for_the_Design_of_Powerful_Student-Centered_Learning_Environments","abstract":"This chapter introduces a situative educational model that involves the following core components: (1) aligned curricular design elements that allow the students to engage with relevant and challenging content to achieve high-level learning outcomes (i.e., performances of understanding, self-regulation, identity development); (2) students are positioned for active participation in knowledge construction and interactions—as accountable authors, active and vocal participants, and responsible co-designers; (3) instructors apply various adaptive instructional strategies to support students’ participatory processes of knowledge construction and to cultivate a productive and supportive classroom community of learners. The chapter concludes, drawing implications for higher education classrooms and institutions, reflecting on potential limitations of this research project and summarizing its main results and contributions.","authors":["Sabine Hoidn"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1057/978-1-349-94941-0_6","In book: Student-Centered Learning Environments in Higher Education Classrooms (pp.341-409)","Project: Student-Centred Learning Environments for Deeper Learning in Higher Education Classrooms"],"references":["321510710_Constructive_Self-Regulated_Situated_and_Collaborative_Learning_An_Approach_for_the_Acquisition_of_Adaptive_Competence","344496512_Shifting_participant_frameworks_orchestrating_thinking_practices_in_group_discussion","333945459_What_the_Best_College_Teachers_Do","321300499_The_Cambridge_handbook_of_the_learning_sciences_second_edition","318148715_E-Learning_in_Higher_Education","313711412_On_Qualitative_Differences_in_Learning_II_Outcome_as_a_Function_of_Learner's_Conception_of_Task","313684874_Exploratory_talk_for_learning","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","311485010_Learning_in_activity","308063491_Empirisch_fundierte_Didaktik_-_didaktisch_fundierte_Unterrichtsforschung_Eine_Perspektive_zur_Neuorientierung_der_Allgemeinen_Didaktik","305688123_Teaching_for_Quality_Learning_at_University","292719942_A_reconceptualisation_of_the_research_into_university_academics_conceptions_of_teaching","292654874_Exploring_talk_in_school_Inspired_by_the_work_of_Douglas_Barnes","292654306_The_value_of_exploratory_talk","289162726_Using_Discourse_Analysis_to_Improve_Classroom_Interaction"]}
