{"id":"294088342_Fisher_encoding_of_differential_fast_point_feature_histograms_for_partial_3D_object_retrieval","abstract":"Partial 3D object retrieval has attracted intense research efforts due to its potential for a wide range of applications, such as 3D object repair and predictive digitization. This work introduces a partial 3D object retrieval method, applicable on both point clouds and structured 3D models, which is based on a shape matching scheme combining local shape descriptors with their Fisher encodings. Experiments on the SHREC 2013 large-scale benchmark dataset for partial object retrieval, as well as on the publicly available Hampson pottery dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms seven recently evaluated partial retrieval methods.","authors":["Michalis Savelonas","Ioannis Pratikakis","Konstantinos Sfikas"],"meta":["February 2016Pattern Recognition 55","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2016.02.003","Project: PRESIOUS: Predictive digitization, restoration and degradation assessment of cultural heritage objects"],"references":["275956107_Partial_3D_Object_Retrieval_combining_Local_Shape_Descriptors_with_Global_Fisher_Vectors","275407126_Locality_in_Generic_Instance_Search_from_One_Example","266200711_An_Overview_of_Partial_3D_Object_Retrieval_Methodologies","319770388_Depth_kernel_descriptors_for_object_recognition","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points","311344255_The_devil_is_in_the_details_an_evaluation_of_recent_feature_encoding_methods","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","277371583_Shape_google","269132845_The_devil_is_in_the_details_An_evaluation_of_recent_feature_encoding_methods","267159091_A_benchmark_of_simulated_range_images_for_partial_shape_retrieval"]}
