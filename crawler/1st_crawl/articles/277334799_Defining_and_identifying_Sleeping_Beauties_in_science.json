{"id":"277334799_Defining_and_identifying_Sleeping_Beauties_in_science","abstract":"A Sleeping Beauty (SB) in science refers to a paper whose importance is not\nrecognized for several years after publication. Its citation history exhibits a\nlong hibernation period followed by a sudden spike of popularity. Previous\nstudies suggest a relative scarcity of SBs. The reliability of this conclusion\nis, however, heavily dependent on identification methods based on arbitrary\nthreshold parameters for sleeping time and number of citations, applied to\nsmall or monodisciplinary bibliographic datasets. Here we present a systematic,\nlarge-scale, and multidisciplinary analysis of the SB phenomenon in science. We\nintroduce a parameter-free measure that quantifies the extent to which a\nspecific paper can be considered an SB. We apply our method to 22 million\nscientific papers published in all disciplines of natural and social sciences\nover a time span longer than a century. Our results reveal that the SB\nphenomenon is not exceptional. There is a continuous spectrum of delayed\nrecognition where both the hibernation period and the awakening intensity are\ntaken into account. Although many cases of SBs can be identified by looking at\nmonodisciplinary bibliographic data, the SB phenomenon becomes much more\napparent with the analysis of multidisciplinary datasets, where we can observe\nmany examples of papers achieving delayed yet exceptional importance in\ndisciplines different from those where they were originally published. Our\nanalysis emphasizes a complex feature of citation dynamics that so far has\nreceived little attention, and also provides empirical evidence against the use\nof short-term citation metrics in the quantification of scientific impact.","authors":["Qing Ke","Emilio Ferrara","Filippo Radicchi","Alessandro Flammini"],"meta":["May 2015Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112(24)","DOI:10.1073/pnas.1424329112","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260439659_Predicting_Scientific_Success_Based_on_Coauthorship_Networks","258631665_How_to_improve_the_prediction_based_on_citation_impact_percentiles_for_years_shortly_after_the_publication_date","258044625_Atypical_Combinations_and_Scientific_Impact","257350831_Quantifying_Long-Term_Scientific_Impact","256117634_Reputation_and_Impact_in_Academic_Careers","248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","239042128_Superconductivity_in_a_Strong_Spin-Exchange_Field","235597204_Transport_of_localized_and_extended_excitations_in_a_nonlinear_Anderson_model","234143280_Social_Dynamics_of_Science","220365133_Sleeping_Beauties_in_Science","220365129_Selecting_scientific_excellence_through_committee_peer_review_A_citation_analysis_of_publications_previously_published_to_approval_or_rejection_of_post-doctoral_research_fellowship_applicants","300156089_Effects_of_Double_Exchange_in_Magnetic_Crystals","285106146_More_delayed_recognition_Part_2_From_inhibin_to_scanning_electron_microscopy","284884007_Premature_discovery_or_delayed_recognition_-_Why","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","281198768_Delayed_recognition_in_scientific_discovery_Citation_frequency_analysis_aids_the_search_for_case_histories","272543860_Toward_Neutral_Principles_of_Constitutional_Law","272102209_Citation_Indexes_for_Science_A_New_Dimension_in_Documentation_through_Association_of_Ideas","271867831_The_Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities","263895016_The_Shockley-Queisser_paper_-_A_notable_example_of_a_scientific_sleeping_beauty","260781819_ErratumCorrelated_lattice_fermions_in_d_dimensions''_Phys_Rev_Lett_62_324_1989","260486354_Principles_of_scientific_research_team_formation_and_evolution","257968324_Hall_Effect_in_Ferromagnetics","257662878_Citation_time_window_choice_for_research_impact_evaluation","257217843_Measuring_the_preferential_attachment_mechanism_in_citation_networks","253800632_Considerations_on_Double_Exchange","252781117_The_Band_Theory_of_Graphite","249984360_The_Constant_Comparative_Method_of_Qualitative_Analysis","243783442_Barab'asi_Statistical_mechanics_of_complex_networks","243772974_Authoritative_Sources_in_a_Hyperlinked_Environment","243764385_A_Computer_Movie_Simulating_Urban_Growth_in_the_Detroit_Region","243699456_Effects_of_Double_Exchange_in_Magnetic_Crystals","243696984_Spin-Orbit_Coupling_Effects_in_Zinc_Blende_Structures","243693571_Interaction_Between_the_d-Shells_in_the_Transition_Metals_II_Ferromagnetic_Compounds_of_Manganese_With_Perovskite_Structure","241763600_The_myth_of_delayed_recognition","239731773_Which_percentile-based_approach_should_be_preferred_for_calculating_normalized_citation_impact_values_An_empirical_comparison_of_five_approaches_including_a_newly_developed_citation-rank_approach_P100","239485396_Correlated_Lattice_Fermions_in_d_Dimensions","239040580_Neutron_Diffraction_Study_of_the_Magnetic_Properties_of_the_Series_of_Perovskite-Type_Compounds_La1-XCaxMnO3","239039719_b-Decay_and_the_Nuclear_Shell_Model","237912898_Authoritative_sources_in_a_hyperlinked_environment","232585427_Eta-Squared_and_Partial_Eta-Squared_in_Fixed_Factor_Anova_Desings","229846441_Chimpanzee_and_human_feet_in_bipdal_walking","228108178_Citation_Analysis_As_A_Tool_in_Journal_Evaluation_-_Journals_Can_be_Ranked_by_Frequency_and_Impact_of_Citations_for_Science_Policy_Studies","228005228_The_Relation_of_Strength_of_Stimulus_to_Rapidity_of_Habit_Formation","227673009_A_General_Theory_of_Bibliometric_and_Other_Cumulative_Advantage_Processes","222712643_Complex_networks_Structure_and_dynamics","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks","220434074_Reference_standards_and_reference_multipliers_for_the_comparison_of_the_citation_impact_of_papers_published_in_different_time_periods","220040705_A_Theory_of_Human_Motivation","209410102_The_influence_of_improvement_in_one_mental_function_upon_the_efficiency_of_other_functions_I","200772409_Psychology_as_the_Behaviorist_Views_It","200703048_Can_Quantum-Mechanical_Description_of_Physical_Reality_Be_Considered_Complete","200104677_Theory_of_the_Role_of_Covalence_in_the_Perovskite-Type_Manganites_La_MIIMn_3","200044629_Coauthorship_networks_and_patterns_of_scientific_collaboration"]}
