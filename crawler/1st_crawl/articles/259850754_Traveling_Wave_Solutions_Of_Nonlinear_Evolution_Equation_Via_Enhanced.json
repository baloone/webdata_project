{"id":"259850754_Traveling_Wave_Solutions_Of_Nonlinear_Evolution_Equation_Via_Enhanced","abstract":"In this article, the Enhanced (G'/G)-expansion method has been projected to\nfind the traveling wave solutions for nonlinear evolution equations(NLEEs) via\nthe (2+1)-dimensional Burgers equation. The efficiency of this method for\nfinding these exact solutions has been demonstrated with the help of symbolic\ncomputation software Maple. By this method we have obtained many new types\nof complexiton soliton solutions, such as, various combinations of trigonometric\nperiodic function and rational function solutions, various combination of\nhyperbolic function and rational function solutions. The proposed method is\ndirect, concise and effective, and can be used for many other nonlinear evolution\nequations.","authors":["Md. Shafiqul Islam","Kamruzzaman Khan","Professor M.
