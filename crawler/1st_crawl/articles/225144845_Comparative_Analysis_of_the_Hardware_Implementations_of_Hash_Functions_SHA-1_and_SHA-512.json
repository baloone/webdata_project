{"id":"225144845_Comparative_Analysis_of_the_Hardware_Implementations_of_Hash_Functions_SHA-1_and_SHA-512","abstract":"Hash functions are among the most widespread cryptographic primitives, and are currently used in multiple cryptographic schemes\nand security protocols such as IPSec and SSL. In this paper, we compare and contrast hardware implementations of the newly\nproposed draft hash standard SHA-512, and the old standard, SHA-1. In our implementation based on Xilinx Virtex FPGAs, the\nthroughput of SHA-512 is equal to 670 Mbit/s, compared to 530 Mbit/s for SHA-1. Our analysis shows that the newly proposed\nhash standard is not only orders of magnitude more secure, but also significantly faster than the old standard. The basic\niterative architectures of both hash functions are faster than the basic iterative architectures of symmetric-key ciphers\nwith equivalent security.","authors":["Tim Grembowski","Roar Lien","Kris Gaj","Nghi Nguyen"],"meta":["October 2007Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45811-5_6","SourceDBLP","Conference: 5th International Information Security Conference (ISC)Volume: 2433"],"references":["298603622_New_advanced_encryption_standard-AES","244446876_Vanstone_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","243772991_Cryptography_and_Network_Security_Principles_And_Practices","242494127_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","221005712_An_FPGA_Implementation_and_Performance_Evaluation_of_the_AES_Block_Cipher_Candidate_Algorithm_Finalists","220695630_Computer_arithmetic_-_algorithms_and_hardware_designs","200065240_Xilinx_Virtex_25_V_Field_Programmable_Gate_Arrays","31746299_Cryptography_and_Network_Security_Principles_and_Practice_W_Stallings","2549329_An_FPGA_Implementation_and_Performance_Evaluation_of_the_AES_Block_Cipher_Candidate_Algorithm_Finalists","2378316_Fast_Implementation_and_Fair_Comparison_of_the_Final_Candidates_for_Advanced_Encryption_Standard_Using_Field_Programmable_Gate_Arrays"]}
