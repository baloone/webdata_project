{"id":"259312799_The_Catalan_Case_of_Armstrong's_Conjecture_on_Simultaneous_Core_Partitions","abstract":"A beautiful recent conjecture of D. Armstrong predicts the average size of a\npartition that is simultaneously an $s$- and a $t$-core, where $s$ and $t$ are\ncoprime. Our goal in this note is to prove this conjecture when $t=s+1$. These\ncores, which are enumerated by Catalan numbers, have average size\n$\\binom{s+1}{3}/2$.","authors":["Richard Stanley","Fabrizio Zanello"],"meta":["December 2013SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 29(1)","DOI:10.1137/130950318","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220915842_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","262222203_Partitions_which_are_simultaneously_t_1_and_t_2_-core","254862999_Results_and_conjectures_on_simultaneous_core_partitions","225670066_Block_inclusions_and_cores_of_partitions"]}
