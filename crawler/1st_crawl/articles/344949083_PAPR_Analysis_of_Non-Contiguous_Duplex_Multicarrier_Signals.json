{"id":"344949083_PAPR_Analysis_of_Non-Contiguous_Duplex_Multicarrier_Signals","abstract":"This paper deals with the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of\nduplex multicarrier signals. A simple but accurate expression of the\ncomplementary cumulative distribution of the PAPR is suggested, based on both empirical and theoretical analyzes of the mean PAPR of such a continuous duplex signal. To this end, we show that the mean PAPR can be written in function of the frequency distance between the two signals composing the duplex one. The relevance and the accuracy of the suggested analysis are shown through simulations, and a discussion paves the way to further analyzes involving general multiplex signals with different powers and subcarriers numbers.","authors":["Vincent Savaux","Yves Louet"],"meta":["January 2021Electronics Letters 57(2):48 - 51","DOI:10.1049/ell2.12049"],"references":["338053524_Peak-to-Average_Power_Ratio_Analysis_for_OFDM-Based_Mixed-Numerology_Transmissions","326502444_PAPR_Analysis_as_a_Ratio_of_Two_Random_Variables_Application_to_Multicarrier_Systems_With_Low_Subcarriers_Number","259397049_Normalized_Gaussian_approach_to_statistical_modeling_of_OFDM_signals","3434482_Derivation_of_PAPR_Distribution_for_OFDM_Wireless_Systems_Based_on_Extreme_Value_Theory","328399965_Global_Power_Amplifier_Efficiency_Evaluation_with_PAPR_Reduction_Method_for_Post-OFDM_Waveforms","309761612_PAPR_analysis_in_noncontiguous_OFDM_systems","260555793_Peak-power_reduction_schemes_in_OFDM_systems_A_review","243672913_OFDM_for_Wireless_Multimedia_Communications","224290652_Peak-to-Average_Power_Ratio_Analysis_for_NC-OFDM_Transmissions","3755353_Reducing_the_Peak_to_Average_Power_Ratio_of_OFDM","3160351_On_the_distribution_of_the_peak-to-average_power_ratio_in_OFDM_Signals"]}
