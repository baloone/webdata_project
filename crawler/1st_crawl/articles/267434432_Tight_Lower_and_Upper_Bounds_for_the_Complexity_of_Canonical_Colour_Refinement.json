{"id":"267434432_Tight_Lower_and_Upper_Bounds_for_the_Complexity_of_Canonical_Colour_Refinement","abstract":"An assignment of colours to the vertices of a graph is stable if any two\nvertices of the same colour have identically coloured neighbourhoods. The goal\nof colour refinement is to find a stable colouring that uses a minimum number\nof colours. This is a widely used subroutine for graph isomorphism testing\nalgorithms, since any automorphism needs to be colour preserving. We give an\n$O((m+n)\\log n)$ algorithm for finding a canonical version of such a stable\ncolouring, on graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We show that no faster\nalgorithm is possible, under some modest assumptions about the type of\nalgorithm, which captures all known colour refinement algorithms.","authors":["Christoph Berkholz","Paul Bonsma","Martin Grohe"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40450-4_13","Conference: European Symposium on Algorithms"],"references":["254920464_Finite_Model_Theory_and_Its_Applications","220688242_Elements_of_Finite_Model_Theory","220618511_Random_Graph_Isomorphism","1921737_Search_Space_Contraction_in_Canonical_Labeling_of_Graphs","284478067_Practical_Graph_Isomorphism","256554890_Partitioning_a_graph_in_OAlog2V","246923286_NAUTY_User''s_Guide_Version_15","236454673_QKPLT_Users_Guide_Version_2_0","235208212_An_N_Log_N_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_States_in_a_Finite_Automaton","223452930_Circular_sturmian_words_and_Hopcroft's_algorithm","222720156_A_linear_time_solution_to_the_single_function_coarsest_partition_problem","222555878_Continuant_polynomials_and_worst-case_behavior_of_Hopcroft's_minimization_algorithm","221590576_Canonical_Labeling_of_Graphs","221568110_On_the_Complexity_of_Hopcroft's_State_Minimization_Algorithm","221499569_An_Optimal_Lower_Bound_on_the_Number_of_Variables_for_Graph_Identification","221150091_Moderately_Exponential_Bound_for_Graph_Isomorphism","220982010_Engineering_an_Efficient_Canonical_Labeling_Tool_for_Large_and_Sparse_Graphs","220692648_Descriptive_Complexity","220616541_Three_Partition_Refinement_Algorithms","220442129_An_optimal_lower_bound_on_the_number_of_variables_for_graph_identifications","220431823_Fibonacci_heaps_and_their_uses_in_improved_network_optimization_algorithms","4086479_Exploiting_structure_in_symmetry_detection_for_CNF","3770656_Fibonacci_Heaps_And_Their_Uses_In_Improved_Network_Optimization_Algorithms","2646917_The_Complexity_of_McKay's_Canonical_Labeling_Algorithm","2441635_Describing_Graphs_A_First-Order_Approach_to_Graph_Canonization"]}
