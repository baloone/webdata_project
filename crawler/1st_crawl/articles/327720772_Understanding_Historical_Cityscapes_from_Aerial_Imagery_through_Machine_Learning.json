{"id":"327720772_Understanding_Historical_Cityscapes_from_Aerial_Imagery_through_Machine_Learning","abstract":"Understanding cityscapes using remote sensing data has been an active\nresearch field for more than two decades. Meanwhile, machine learning provides\ngeneralization capabilities compared to hierarchical and rule-based methods.\nThis paper evaluates several machine learning algorithms in order to fuse shadow\ndetection and shadow compensation methods for building detection using high\nresolution aerial imagery. Three complex and real-life urban study areas were\nused as test datasets with various: i) kinds of buildings structures of special\narchitecture, ii) pixel resolutions and, iii) types of data. Objective evaluation\nmetrics have been used for assessing the compared algorithms such recall,\nprecision and F1-score as well as rates of completeness, correctness and quality.\nFor both approaches, i.e., shadow detection and building detection, the\ncomputational complexity of each machine learning algorithm was examined.\nThe results indicate that deep learning schemes, such a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN), provides the best classification performance in terms of shadow\ndetection and building detection.","authors":["Evangelos Maltezos","Eftychios Protopapadakis","Nikolaos Doulamis","Anastasios Doulamis"],"meta":["September 2018","Conference: 7th International Conference, EuroMed 2018At: Nicosia, Cyprus, October 29th - November 3rd, 2018","Project: Inachus"],"references":["321503435_A_Shadow-Overlapping_Algorithm_for_Estimating_Building_Heights_From_VHR_Satellite_Images","320074926_Fast_Shadow_Detection_from_a_Single_Image_Using_a_Patched_Convolutional_Neural_Network","320052364_Classification_of_Architectural_Heritage_Images_Using_Deep_Learning_Techniques","319876469_AUTOMATED_CLASSIFICATION_OF_HERITAGE_BUILDINGS_FOR_AS-BUILT_BIM_USING_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES","319855375_SHADOWDETECTION_FROM_VHR_AERIAL_IMAGES_IN_URBAN_AREA_BY_USING_3D_CITY_MODELS_AND_A_DECISION_FUSION_APPROACH","317783681_Saving_Cultural_Heritage_with_Digital_Make-Believe_Machine_Learning_and_Digital_Techniques_to_the_Rescue","317041270_A_LiDAR-aided_urban-scale_assessment_of_soil-structure_interaction_effects_the_case_of_Kalochori_residential_area_N_Greece","308371567_Cultural_Heritage_Sites_in_Danger-Towards_Automatic_Damage_Detection_from_Space","301880609_The_Cityscapes_Dataset_for_Semantic_Urban_Scene_Understanding","292643519_AUTOMATIC_EXTRACTION_OF_URBAN_STRUCTURES_BASED_ON_SHADOW_INFORMATION_FROM_SATELLITE_IMAGERY","282521303_5D_Modelling_An_Efficient_Approach_for_Creating_Spatiotemporal_Predictive_3D_Maps_of_Large-Scale_Cultural_Resources","271849006_Automated_Extraction_of_the_Archaeological_Tops_of_Qanat_Shafts_from_VHR_Imagery_in_Google_Earth","260297773_Dense_image_matching_Comparisons_and_analyses","259135506_Results_of_the_ISPRS_benchmark_on_urban_object_detection_and_3D_building_reconstruction","258656565_A_Complete_Processing_Chain_for_Shadow_Detection_and_Reconstruction_in_VHR_Images","224393093_A_Comparison_of_Evaluation_Techniques_for_Building_Extraction_From_Airborne_Laser_Scanning","224244202_Mining_Distinction_and_Commonality_Across_Multiple_Domains_Using_Generative_Model_for_Text_Classification","44288385_Survey_of_Nearest_Neighbor_Techniques","321609351_Deep_convolutional_neural_networks_for_building_extraction_from_orthoimages_and_dense_image_matching_point_clouds","321596166_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Classification","299570598_A_Survey_on_Object_Detection_in_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Images","294577401_Random_forest_in_remote_sensing_A_review_of_applications_and_future_directions","292739269_The_DGPF-test_on_digital_airborne_camera_evaluation-overview_and_test_design","283886548_A_genetically_optimized_neural_classifier_applied_to_numerical_pile_integrity_tests_considering_concrete_piles","264196715_Shadow_Detection_and_Reconstruction_in_High-Resolution_Satellite_Images_via_Morphological_Filtering_and_Example-Based_Learning","261959627_Hybrid_decision_tree_and_naive_Bayes_classifiers_for_multi-class_classification_tasks","258651060_Shadow_Detection_and_Removal_from_Remote_Sensing_Images_using_NDI_and_Morphological_Operators","247153035_Ensemble_Methods_for_Multi-label_Classification"]}
