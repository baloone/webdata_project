{"id":"307171948_A_Cryptosystem_Based_On_Vigenere_Cipher_By_Using_Mulitlevel_Encryption_Scheme","abstract":"In today's world securing information in internet has become a crucial task. To secure such information, encryption plays an important role in information security. In this paper Vigenere cipher is considered which is to be most efficient and simplest one. Due to its repeating nature of the key it is vulnerable to attacks like Kasiski, known plain text etc., to find the length of encryption key. To overcome this, multi level encryption is done by using Vigenere cipher to improve better security against cryptanalysis.","authors":["Sanjeev Kumar Mandal","A R Deepti"],"meta":["August 2016","Project: Network Security"],"references":["319135965_Developing_a_Modified_Hybrid_Caesar_Cipher_and_Vigenere_Cipher_for_Secure_Data_Communication","318775393_The_Internet_Engineering_Task_Force","269669860_Enhancing_Security_of_Vigenere_Cipher_by_Stream_Cipher","257334269_Security_Models_and_Proof_Strategies_for_Plaintext-Aware_Encryption","242073310_Cryptology_From_Caesar_Ciphers_to_Public-Key_Cryptosystems"]}
