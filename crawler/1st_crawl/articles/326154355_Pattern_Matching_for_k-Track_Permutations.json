{"id":"326154355_Pattern_Matching_for_k-Track_Permutations","abstract":"Given permutations \\(\\tau \\) and \\(\\pi \\), the permutation pattern (PP) problem is to decide whether \\(\\pi \\) occurs in \\(\\tau \\) as an order-isomorphic subsequence. Although an FPT algorithm is known for PP parameterized by the size of the pattern \\(|\\pi |\\) [Guillemot and Marx 2014], the high complexity of this algorithm makes it impractical for most instances. In this paper we approach the PP problem from k-track permutations, i.e. those permutations that are the union of k increasing patterns or, equivalently, those permutation that avoid the decreasing pattern \\((k+1) k \\ldots 1\\). Recently, k-track permutations have been shown to be central combinatorial objects in the study of the PP problem. Indeed, the PP problem is NP-complete when \\(\\pi \\) is 321-avoiding and \\(\\tau \\) is 4321-avoiding but is solvable in polynomial-time if both \\(\\pi \\) and \\(\\tau \\) avoid 321. We propose and implement an exact algorithm, FPT for parameters k and \\(|\\pi |\\), which allows to solve efficiently some large instances.","authors":["Laurent Bulteau","Romeo Rizzi","St√©phane Vialette"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-94667-2_9","In book: Combinatorial Algorithms (pp.102-114)"],"references":["305427789_Pattern_Matching_for_321-Avoiding_Permutations","248395120_Finding_small_patterns_in_permutations_in_linear_time","222426344_On_Minimum_k-Modal_Partitions_of_Permutations","221543412_Algorithms_for_Pattern_Involvement_in_Permutations","220286948_Monotonic_Coverings_of_Finite_Sets","2311239_Permutations_Which_Are_the_Union_of_an_Increasing_and_a_Decreasing_Subsequence","2140556_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Length_of_the_Longest_Increasing_Subsequence_of_Random_Permutations","312077527_Hardness_of_Permutation_Pattern_Matching","310803821_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Permutation_Pattern_Matching_Based_on_Alternating_Runs","308391020_Pattern_Matching_for_Separable_Permutations","293092318_The_surprising_mathematics_of_longest_increasing_subsequences","283117811_The_Complexity_of_Pattern_Matching_for_321-Avoiding_and_Skew-Merged_Permutations","268992235_Patterns_in_Permutations_and_Words","265351744_Variations_on_the_Monotone_Subsequence_Theme_of_Erds_and_Szekeres","234430339_Combinatorial_Algorithms_for_Computers_and_Calculators","234028477_The_computational_landscape_of_permutation_patterns","223839014_Fast_computation_of_a_longest_increasing_subsequence_and_application","222720774_Pattern_Matching_for_Permutations","222504094_Finding_pattern_matchings_for_permutations","222358987_Partitioning_permutations_into_increasing_and_decreasing_subsequences","220533320_On_Complexity_of_the_Subpattern_Problem","220286916_On_Partitions_of_Permutations_into_Increasing_and_Decreasing_Subsequences","220112518_Approximating_minimum_cocolorings"]}
