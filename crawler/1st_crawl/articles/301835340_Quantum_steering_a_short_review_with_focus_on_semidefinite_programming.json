{"id":"301835340_Quantum_steering_a_short_review_with_focus_on_semidefinite_programming","abstract":"Quantum steering refers to a situation where two parties share a bipartite system onto which one of the parties applies measurements that changes the state of the other party in a way that can not be explained by classical means. Quantum steering has been interpreted as the task of entanglement detection in a one-sided device independent way and has received a lot of attention since then. Here we address the characterisation of quantum steering through semidefinite programming, including steering detection, quantification and applications. We also give a brief overview of some results on quantum steering not directly related to semidefinite programming. Finally, we make available a list of semidefinite programming codes that can be used to study the topics discussed in this article.","authors":["Daniel Cavalcanti","Paul Skrzypczyk"],"meta":["April
