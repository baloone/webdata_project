{"id":"313067517_Deriving_Inverse_Operators_for_Modal_Logic","abstract":"Spatial constraint systems are algebraic structures from concurrent constraint programming to specify spatial and epistemic behavior in multi-agent systems. We shall use spatial constraint systems to give an abstract characterization of the notion of normality in modal logic and to derive right inverse/reverse operators for modal languages. In particular, we shall identify the weakest condition for the existence of right inverses and show that the abstract notion of normality corresponds to the preservation of finite suprema. We shall apply our results to existing modal languages such as the weakest normal modal logic, Hennessy-Milner logic, and linear-time temporal logic. We shall discuss our results in the context of modal concepts such as bisimilarity and inconsistency invariance.","authors":["Michell Guzm√°n","Salim Perchy","Camilo Rueda","Frank D.
