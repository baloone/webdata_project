{"id":"339567472_A_tutorial_on_calibration_measurements_and_calibration_models_for_clinical_prediction_models","abstract":"Our primary objective is to provide the clinical informatics community with an introductory tutorial on calibration measurements and calibration models for predictive models using existing R packages and custom implemented code in R on real and simulated data. Clinical predictive model performance is commonly published based on discrimination measures, but use of models for individualized predictions requires adequate model calibration. This tutorial is intended for clinical researchers who want to evaluate predictive models in terms of their applicability to a particular population. It is also for informaticians and for software engineers who want to understand the role that calibration plays in the evaluation of a clinical predictive model, and to provide them with a solid starting point to consider incorporating calibration evaluation and calibration models in their work.\nCovered topics include (1) an introduction to the importance of calibration in the clinical setting, (2) an illustration of the distinct roles that discrimination and calibration play in the assessment of clinical predictive models, (3) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration measurements, (4) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration models, and (5) a brief discussion of limitations of these methods and practical suggestions on how to use them in practice.","authors":["Yingxiang Huang","Wentao Li","Fima Macheret","Rodney A Gabriel"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 27(4)","DOI:10.1093/jamia/ocz228"],"references":["334900419_Assessment_of_heterogeneity_in_an_individual_participant_data_meta-analysis_of_prediction_models_An_overview_and_illustration","334228499_The_Integrated_Calibration_Index_ICI_and_related_metrics_for_quantifying_the_calibration_of_logistic_regression_models","325029912_External_validation_of_four_dementia_prediction_models_for_use_in_the_general_community-dwelling_population_a_comparative_analysis_from_the_Rotterdam_Study","331718962_Mortality_prediction_following_non-traumatic_amputation_of_the_lower_extremity_Prediction_of_12-month_amputation_mortality","330704355_Calibrating_Classification_Probabilities_with_Shape-Restricted_Polynomial_Regression","328914460_Estimating_Cardiovascular_Risk","327226560_Statistical_Evaluation_of_Diagnostic_Performance_Topics_in_ROC_Analysis","325350179_Deep_Learning_for_the_Internet_of_Things","324848147_Predicting_suicide_attempts_in_adolescents_with_longitudinal_clinical_data_and_machine_learning","324800593_A_simple_test_procedure_in_standardizing_the_power_of_Hosmer-Lemeshow_test_in_large_data_sets"]}
