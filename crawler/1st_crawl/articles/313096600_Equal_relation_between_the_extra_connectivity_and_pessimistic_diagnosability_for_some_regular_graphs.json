{"id":"313096600_Equal_relation_between_the_extra_connectivity_and_pessimistic_diagnosability_for_some_regular_graphs","abstract":"Extra connectivity and the pessimistic diagnosis are two crucial subjects for a multiprocessor system's ability to tolerate and diagnose faulty processor. The pessimistic diagnosis strategy is a classic strategy based on the PMC model in which isolates all faulty vertices within a set containing at most one fault-free vertex. In this paper, the result that the pessimistic diagnosability $t_p(G)$ equals the extra connectivity $\\kappa_{1}(G)$ of a regular graph $G$ under some conditions are shown. Furthermore, the following new results are gotten: the pessimistic diagnosability $t_p(S_n^2)=4n-9$ for split-star networks $S_n^2$, $t_p(\\Gamma_n)=2n-4$ for Cayley graphs generated by transposition trees $\\Gamma_n$, $t_p(\\Gamma_{n}(\\Delta))=4n-11$ for Cayley graph generated by the $2$-tree $\\Gamma_{n}(\\Delta)$, $t_{p}(BP_n)=2n-2$ for the burnt pancake networks $BP_n$. As corollaries, the known results about the extra connectivity and the pessimistic diagnosability of many famous networks including the alternating group graphs, the alternating group networks, BC networks, the $k$-ary $n$-cube networks etc. are obtained directly.","authors":["Mei-Mei Gu","Rong-Xia Hao","Jun-Ming Xu","Yan-Quan Feng"],"meta":["June 2017Theoretical Computer Science 690(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.05.036"],"references":["280063322_The_Extra_Connectivity_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Alternating_Group_Networks","273475187_The_-Diagnosability_of_Star_Graph_Networks","272385924_The_Extra_Restricted_Connectivity_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Split-Star_Networks","265706084_3-extra_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_generating_trees","263094074_On_3-Extra_Connectivity_and_3-Extra_Edge_Connectivity_of_Folded_Hypercubes","233426980_Generalized_Measures_of_Fault_Tolerance_in_Exchanged_Hypercubes","227863654_A_new_class_of_interconnection_networks_based_on_the_alternating_group","220358541_Construction_of_vertex-disjoint_paths_in_alternating_group_networks","220238770_The_Spanning_Connectivity_of_the_Burnt_Pancake_Graphs","220185761_On_the_extraconnectivity_of_graphs","313615523_Generalized_measures_of_fault_tolerance_with_application_to_ncube_networks","310800920_The_pessimistic_diagnosability_of_bubble-sort_star_graphs_and_augmented_k-ary_n-cubes","309127386_The_pessimistic_diagnosability_of_three_kinds_of_graphs","305363468_The_extra_connectivity_of_bubble-sort_star_graphs","297322913_Fault_hamiltonicity_and_fault_hamiltonian_connectivity_of_the_arrangement_graphs","293328537_On_extra_connectivity_and_extra_edge-connectivity_of_balanced_hypercubes","293276064_Extraconnectivity_of_Folded_Hypercubes","292011638_BC_interconnection_networks_and_their_properties","284105849_The_super_twisted_cubes_interconnection_networks_and_their_properties","282834688_On_the_extraconnectivity_of_k_-ary_n_-cube_networks","276881429_The_pessimistic_diagnosability_of_alternating_group_graphs_under_the_PMC_model","275412675_Fault_tolerance_and_diagnosability_of_burnt_pancake_networks_under_the_comparison_model","268165077_Characterize_a_kind_of_fault_tolerance_of_alternating_group_network","266915525_On_restricted_edge_connectivity_and_extra_edge_connectivity_of_hypercubes_and_folded_hypercubes","265988070_Increasing_the_connectivity_of_split-stars","262252564_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model","262171411_Fault_isolation_and_identification_in_general_biswapped_networks_under_the_PMC_diagnostic_model","260585560_A_Quick_Pessimistic_Diagnosis_Algorithm_for_Hypercube-Like_Multiprocessor_Systems_under_the_PMC_Model","260585387_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Alternating_Group_Graphs","260464513_3-extra_connectivity_of_3-ary_n-cube_networks","257145053_Extraconnectivity_of_-ary_-cube_networks","256744864_2323-Extraconnectivities_of_hypercube-like_networks","239329249_A_New_Class_of_Cayley_Networks_Based_on_the_Alternating_Groups","235246878_A_kind_of_conditional_vertex_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_2-trees","233444445_The_diagnosability_of_the_k-ary_n-cubes_using_the_pessimistic_strategy","224097531_Diagnosability_of_Two-Matching_Composition_Networks_under_the_MM_Model","222437944_Bounds_for_sorting_by_prefix_reversal","221499447_A_Polynomial_Time_Algorithm_For_Fault_Diagnosability","220715729_The_Study_of_Fault_Tolerance_on_Alternating_Group_Networks","220620578_Super_Connectivity_of_Star_Graphs_Alternating_Group_Graphs_and_Split-Stars","220570522_Strong_structural_properties_of_unidirectional_star_graphs","220568906_Girth_of_pancake_graphs","220513766_Orienting_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","220358508_On_conditional_diagnosability_and_reliability_of_the_BC_networks","220318681_Extraconnectivity_of_hypercubes_II","220246023_The_Conditional_Node_Connectivity_Of_The_k-Ary_n-Cube","220209380_Linearly_Many_Faults_in_2-Tree-Generated_Networks","220189588_Extraconnectivity_of_s-geodetic_digraphs_and_graphs","220155439_On_average_and_highest_number_of_flips_in_pancake_sorting","220115200_Conditional_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","220114487_Fault-tolerant_routing_in_burnt_pancake_graphs","3602467_Class_of_hypercube-like_networks","3300189_Fault_diameter_of_k-ary_n-cube_networks","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3300295_Diagnosability_of_the_Mobius_cubes"]}
