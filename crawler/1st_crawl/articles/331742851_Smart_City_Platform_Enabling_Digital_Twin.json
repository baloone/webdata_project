{"id":"331742851_Smart_City_Platform_Enabling_Digital_Twin","abstract":"Visual 3D models are being deployed in smart cities around the world. While earlier the motivation was mostly to visualise the buildings, the latest developments will turn the 3D models into a rich source of information related to the urban landscape and built environment. The models can be used to compare the energy consumption between similar buildings or to display the potential solar panels had if mounted on certain district. The models have soon become elemental in not only managing a smart city but also as a platform for co-design and development together with the citizens.","authors":["Timo Ruohomäki","Outi Kesäniemi","Enni Airaksinen","Mikko Martikka"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1109/IS.2018.8710517","Conference: IEEE Intelligent Systems 2018At: Madeira, Portugal","Project: mySMARTLife"],"references":["237443110_CityGML_-_Interoperable_access_to_3D_city_models","226504520_Representing_and_Exchanging_3D_City_Models_with_CityGML","225135057_The_roles_of_geography_markup_language_GML_scalable_vector_graphics_SVG_and_Web_feature_service_WFS_specifications_in_the_development_of_Internet_geographic_information_systems_GIS"]}
