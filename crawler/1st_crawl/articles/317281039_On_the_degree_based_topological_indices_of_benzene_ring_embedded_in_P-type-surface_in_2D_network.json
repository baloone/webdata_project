The importance of topological indices is generally linked with QSAR/QSPR. In this paper, we compute general Zagreb (Mα) index, general Randić connectivity (Rα) index, general sum-connectivity (χα) index, atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index and geometric-arithmetic (GA) index, ABC4; GA5; multiple Zagreb indices and Zagreb polynomials indices of the benzene ring embedded in P-type-surface in 2D network.","authors":["Ali Ahmad"],"meta":["January 2017Hacettepe Journal of Mathematics and Statistics 4(46)","DOI:10.15672/HJMS.2017.443"],"references":[]}
