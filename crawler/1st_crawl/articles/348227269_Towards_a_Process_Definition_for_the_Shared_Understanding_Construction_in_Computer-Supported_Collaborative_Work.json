{"id":"348227269_Towards_a_Process_Definition_for_the_Shared_Understanding_Construction_in_Computer-Supported_Collaborative_Work","abstract":"In Computer-Supported Collaborative Work - CSCW, there are factors that affect the collaboration achievement, as for example, the difficulty of having all group members participate effectively in the development of an idea, for this, it is necessary to go beyond having the activity and the technological tools. A deeper approach must be taken through some external factors’ analysis, among them, cognitive processes. One of these cognitive processes is shared understanding, which refers to the degree to which group members concur on a topic, its interpretation, when they share a perspective (mutual agreement), or can act in a coordinated manner. This is why, this paper presents a process proposal initial for the shared understanding construction in a problem-solving activity, where the aim is to achieve, before starting the executing process of the task, way a shared understanding of the objective, that is, the whole group knows what is to be achieved at the end of the activity. This paper is intended to show an initial version of this process, where was validated its viability and usefulness in shared understanding construction, through an experiment with students from two Latin American Universities. For this work, a substantial body of research was consolidated using the multi-cycle action-research methodology with a three-cycle bifurcation. According to the results, it can be said that the process is feasible and useful for the shared understanding construction since the application of the process allows achieving it, however, it was discovered that it has aspects to improve from the viewpoint of high cognitive load that generates its use and the need to monitor and assist maintain the shared understanding.","authors":["Vanessa Agredo Delgado","Pablo Hernando Ruiz","Alicia Mon","César A.
