{"id":"280640341_Big_Data_Visualisation_in_Immersive_Virtual_Reality_Environments_Embodied_Phenomenological_Perspectives_to_Interaction","abstract":"Ever-increasing human-computer interactions with various tracking technologies are creating unprecedented amounts of data. The amount and complexity of this 'big data' creates various challenges for its storage, analysis and presentation, but at the same time, big data is suggested to open up opportunities for those who can leverage it. This paper will discuss using immersive virtual reality environments for visualising, interacting and making sense of big data. It reveals that many of the developed applications do not justify their approaches to presentation or interaction. A phenomenological perspective of embodied perception and interaction is discussed to ground future developments.","authors":["Marko Ter√§s","Shriram Raghunathan"],"meta":["August 2015International Journal of Soft Computing 05(04):1009-1015","DOI:10.21917/ijsc.2015.0141","Project: The user experience of virtual environments in safety training: A phenomenological approach."],"references":["275067734_Learning_Analytics_Framework_for_Educational_Virtual_Worlds","272740157_Network_Dynamics_with_BrainX3_A_Large-Scale_Simulation_of_the_Human_Brain_Network_with_Real-Time_Interaction","270595015_Harvesting_Big_Data_to_Enhance_Supply_Chain_Innovation_Capabilities_An_Analytic_Infrastructure_Based_on_Deduction_Graph","270276259_How_'big_data'_can_make_big_impact_Findings_from_a_systematic_review_and_a_longitudinal_case_study","261599416_Application_of_Learning_Analytics_in_Educational_Videogames","275358782_Internet-Based_Brain_Training_Games_Citizen_Scientists_and_Big_Data_Ethical_Issues_in_Unprecedented_Virtual_Territories","269288536_Data_barns_ambient_intelligence_and_cloud_computing_the_tacit_epistemology_and_linguistic_representation_of_Big_Data","263241485_The_rise_of_Big_Data_What_does_it_mean_for_education_technology_and_media_research","261456895_Big_data_A_review","257252937_The_embodiment_of_sexualized_virtual_selves_The_Proteus_effect_and_experiences_of_self-objectification_via_avatars"]}
