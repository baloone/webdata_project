{"id":"228818136_An_extension_of_a_combinatorial_fixed_point_theorem_of_Shih_and_Dong","abstract":"Shih and Dong have proved a boolean analogue of the Jacobian problem: if a map from to itself has the property that all the boolean eigenvalues of the discrete Jacobian matrix of each element of are zero, then it has a unique fixed point. In this note, this result is extended to any map F from the product X of n finite intervals of integers to itself. Our method of proof reveals an interesting property of the asynchronous state graph of F used to model the qualitative behavior of genetic regulatory networks.","authors":["Adrien Richard"],"meta":["October 2008Advances in Applied Mathematics 41(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.aam.2007.05.006"],"references":["10732809_Multistationarity_the_basis_of_cell_differentiation_and_memory_II_Logical_analysis_of_regulatory_networks_in_terms_of_feedback_circuits","246679114_Les_systemes_dynamiques_discrets","243770271_Discrete_Iterations_A_Metric_Study","228612852_Solution_of_the_Boolean_Markus-Yamabe_Problem_1","223067330_A_combinatorial_analogue_of_the_Jacobian_problem_in_automata_networks","222635035_Theoremes_de_Perron-Frobenius_et_Stein-Rosenberg_booleens","222431716_Necessary_conditions_for_multistationarity_in_discrete_dynamical_systems","222050596_Derivee_Discrete_et_Comportement_Local_d'Une_Iteration_Discrbte"]}
