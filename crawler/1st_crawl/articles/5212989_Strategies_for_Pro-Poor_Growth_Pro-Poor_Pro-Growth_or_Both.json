{"id":"5212989_Strategies_for_Pro-Poor_Growth_Pro-Poor_Pro-Growth_or_Both","abstract":"What is pro-poor growth, and is it a useful concept for African development policy? This paper examines the debate between\nproponents of growth and poverty reduction, highlighting the diversity of regional and country experiences in promoting development\nwith these two objectives. The author concludes that the most effective development policies will be those that advocate a\nshared growth strategy, using public policy to create growth, while also promoting the engagement of the poor to ensure that\nthey are active participants in, and beneficiaries of growth. Natural resource revenue management, agricultural exports, and\nregional integration are highlighted as three of the most promising areas for promoting such growth strategies.","authors":["John Page"],"meta":["December 2006Journal of African Economies 15(4):510-542","DOI:10.1093/jae/ejk009","SourceRePEc"],"references":["280884013_The_Key_to_the_East_Asian_Miracle_Making_Shared_Growth_Credible","253876792_What_is_Pro-poor_Growth","242558026_What_do_we_know_about_Sub-Saharan_Africa's_Infrastructure_and_the_Impact_of_its_1990s_reforms","228638321_Operationalizing_Pro-Poor_Growth_Ghana_Case_Study","215665916_Agriculture_Rural_Development_and_Pro-poor_Growth_Country_Experiences_in_the_Post-Reform_Era","23722654_The_Political_Economy_of_Fiscal_Policy_and_Economic_Management_in_Oil-Exporting_Countries","5125900_Policy_Towards_Commodity_Shocks_in_Developing_Countries","4861703_The_growth_elasticity_of_poverty_reduction_explaining_heterogeneity_across_countries_and_time_periods","288809788_How_good_is_growth","272916935_African_Politics_and_Problems_in_Development","257926588_Economic_Growth_in_the_1990s_Learning_From_a_Decade_of_Reform","247566923_Redistribution_With_Growth","235737405_Resource_Abundance_and_Economic_Development","228730739_When_I_Use_a_Word_Pro-poor_Growth_and_Poverty_Reduction","222689903_Growth_Inequality_and_Poverty_Looking_Beyond_Averages","222502068_Can_High_Inequality_Developing_Countries_Escape_Absolute_Poverty","44821750_World_Development_Indicators_WDI_2007_Database","44818256_The_East_Asian_miracle_Economic_growth_and_public_policy","37901704_Essays_on_the_Political_Economy_of_Rural_Africa","23747424_In_Search_of_the_Holy_Grail_How_to_Achieve_Pro-poor_Growth","23695460_Addressing_the_Natural_Resource_Curse_An_Illustration_From_Nigeria","5217486_A_New_Dataset_Measuring_Income_Inequality","5212978_Infrastructure_Regional_Integration_and_Growth_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa_Dealing_with_the_Disadvantages_of_Geography_and_Sovereign_Fragmentation","5149880_Life_During_Growth","4918863_Growth_and_Well-being_Introducing_Distribution-Weighted_Growth_Rates_to_Reevaluate_US_Post-war_Economic_Performance","4809383_Explaining_International_and_Intertemporal_Income_Inequality","2514826_What_Can_New_Survey_Data_Tell_Us_About_Recent_Changes_in_Distribution_of_Poverty","2502585_Measuring_Pro-Poor_Growth","2497921_Growth_Inequality_and_Poverty_Looking_Beyond_Averages","2497289_Growth_Is_Good_for_the_Poor"]}
