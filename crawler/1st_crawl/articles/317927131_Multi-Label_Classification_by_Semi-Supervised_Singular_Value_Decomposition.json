{"id":"317927131_Multi-Label_Classification_by_Semi-Supervised_Singular_Value_Decomposition","abstract":"Multi-label problems arise in various domains including automatic multimedia data categorization, and have generated significant interest in computer vision and machine learning community. However, existing methods do not adequately address two key challenges: exploiting correlations between labels and making up for the lack of labeled data or even missing labeled data. In this paper, we proposed to use a semi-supervised singular value decomposition to handle these two challenges. The proposed model takes advantage of the nuclear norm regularization on the singular value decomposition to effectively capture the label correlations. Meanwhile, it introduces manifold regularization on mapping to capture the intrinsic structure among data, which provides a good way to reduce the required labeled data with improving the classification performance. Furthermore, we designed an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed model based on alternating direction method of multipliers and thus it can efficiently deal with large-scale datasets. Experimental results for synthetic and real-world multimedia data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can exploit the label correlations and obtain promising and better label prediction results than state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Liping Jing","Chenyang Shen","Liu Yang","Jian Yu"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2017.2719939"],"references":["305386928_Maximum-margin_matrix_factorization","266660282_Active_learning_for_sparse_bayesian_multilabel_classification","263813673_A_Review_On_Multi-Label_Learning_Algorithms","261524983_Label-Embedding_for_Attribute-Based_Classification","257618371_On_label_dependence_and_loss_minimization_in_multi-label_classification","250613752_Large-scale_Multi-label_Learning_with_Missing_Labels","221654680_Hypergraph_Spectral_Learning_for_Multi-label_Classification","221346480_Large_Scale_Max-Margin_Multi-Label_Classification_with_Priors","220412051_Inexact_Alternating_Direction_Methods_for_Image_Recovery","220073602_Random_k-Labelsets_for_Multi-Label_Classification","215721835_Self-Tuning_Spectral_Clustering","23936205_New_multicategory_boosting_algorithms_based_on_multicategory_Fisher-consistent_losses","316682495_Conditional_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_for_Multi-label_Learning_with_Incomplete_Labels","316237145_Learning_Hierarchical_Multi-Category_Text_Classification_Models","313418906_Bayes_optimal_multilabel_classification_via_probabilistic_classifier_chains","313394425_Multi-label_classification_via_feature-aware_implicit_label_space_encoding","309476423_Multi-label_learning_by_exploiting_label_correlations_locally","286987093_Feature-aware_label_space_dimension_reduction_for_multi-label_classification","284106969_Scholkopf_B_learning_with_local_and_global_vonsistency","273395534_Matrix_Completion_for_Weakly-Supervised_Multi-Label_Image_Classification","271402151_The_SUN_Attribute_Database_Beyond_Categories_for_Deeper_Scene_Understanding","262164698_Active_learning_with_multi-label_SVM_classification","258727003_A_Unified_Convergence_Analysis_of_Block_Successive_Minimization_Methods_for_Nonsmooth_Optimization","224976748_Multilabel_Classification_with_Principal_Label_Space_Transformation","224207514_Graph_Regularized_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_for_Data_Representation","223969598_Robust_Recovery_of_Subspace_Structures_by_Low-Rank_Representation","221618910_Label_Embedding_Trees_for_Large_Multi-Class_Tasks","221615192_Collective_multi-label_classification","220343736_Proximal_Support_Vector_Machine_Classifiers","220320881_Multi-Label_Output_Codes_using_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis","220319905_Manifold_Regularization_A_Geometric_Framework_for_Learning_from_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Examples","220133672_A_Singular_Value_Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Matrix_Completion","51934906_Linearized_Alternating_Direction_Method_with_Adaptive_Penalty_forLow-Rank_Representation","46587364_The_Augmented_Lagrange_Multiplier_Method_for_Exact_Recovery_of_Corrupted_Low-Rank_Matrices","32964903_Graph_Regularized_Non-negative_Matrix_Factorization_for_Data_Representation","23985260_Multi-Label_Prediction_via_Compressed_Sensing","4993345_Dimension_reduction_and_coefficient_estimation_in_multivariate_linear_regression"]}
