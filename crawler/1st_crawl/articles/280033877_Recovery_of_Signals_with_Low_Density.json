{"id":"280033877_Recovery_of_Signals_with_Low_Density","abstract":"Sparse signals (i.e., vectors with a small number of non-zero entries) build\nthe foundation of most kernel (or nullspace) results, uncertainty relations,\nand recovery guarantees in the sparse signal processing and compressive sensing\nliterature. In this paper, we introduce a novel signal-density measure that\nextends the common notion of sparsity to non-sparse signals whose entries'\nmagnitudes decay rapidly. By taking into account such magnitude information, we\nderive a more general and less restrictive kernel result and uncertainty\nrelation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nsignal-density measure by showing that orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)\nprovably recovers low-density signals with up to 2$\\times$ more non-zero\ncoefficients compared to that guaranteed by standard results for sparse\nsignals.","authors":["Christoph Studer"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["311805189_Relaxed_Recovery_Conditions_for_OMPOLS_by_Exploiting_Both_Coherence_and_Decay","259954197_Relaxed_Recovery_Conditions_for_OMPOLS_by_Exploiting_both_Coherence_and_Decay","238591008_Uncertainty_Principles_and_Signal_Recovery","234028549_A_Method_for_Finding_Structured_Sparse_Solutions_to_Non-negative_LeastSquares_Problems_with_Applications","228060319_On_the_Theorem_of_Uniform_Recovery_of_Random_Sampling_Matrices","220680974_Stable_recovery_of_sparse_overcomplete_representations_in_the_presence_of_noise","220116567_From_Sparse_Solutions_of_Systems_of_Equations_to_Sparse_Modeling_of_Signals_and_Images","48204043_Recovery_of_Sparsely_Corrupted_Signals","3084926_Sparse_Representations_in_Unions_of_Bases","3080794_A_generalized_uncertainty_principle_and_sparse_representation_in_pairs_of_bases","2938620_Sparse_Representations_Are_Most_Likely_to_Be_the_Sparsest_Possible","292215307_Just_relax_Convex_programming_methods_for_identifying_sparse_signals_in_noise","224667824_Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_Recursive_Function_Approximation_with_Applications_to_Wavelet_Decomposition","224168197_Analysis_of_Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_Using_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property","224144740_Coherence-Based_Performance_Guarantees_for_Estimating_a_Sparse_Vector_Under_Random_Noise","224134546_Computational_Methods_for_Sparse_Solution_of_Linear_Inverse_Problems","224120632_Block-Sparse_Signals_Uncertainty_Relations_and_Efficient_Recovery","220691600_Sparse_and_Redundant_Representations_-_From_Theory_to_Applications_in_Signal_and_Image_Processing","48200485_Uncertainty_Relations_and_Sparse_Signal_Recovery_for_Pairs_of_GeneralSignal_Sets","45913742_Performance_Analysis_of_Sparse_Recovery_Based_on_Constrained_MinimalSingular_Values","3322018_Wakin_MB_An_introduction_to_compressive_sampling_IEEE_Signal_Process_Mag_252_21-30","3085754_Tropp_JA_Just_relax_convex_programming_methods_for_identifying_sparse_signals_in_noise_IEEE_Trans_Inf_Theory_52_1030-1051"]}
