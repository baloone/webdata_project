{"id":"328940898_Ranking_objects_from_a_preference_relation_over_their_subsets","abstract":"In many everyday situations, we need to rank individuals or single items having the possibility to observe the behavior of groups. In this paper we propose a way to get this ranking over the elements of a set X, starting from an arbitrary preference relation over the subsets of X and taking into account the information provided by this ranking over the subsets. To this purpose, we use a very common approach in the social choice framework: we single out some properties that a general solution should satisfy, and we prove that these properties characterize a unique solution. Given the generality of the approach, we believe that this paper is only a starting point for a more extended analysis. In particular, it is clear that different contexts can suggest other properties, thus identifying alternative ranking methods.","authors":["Giulia Bernardi","Roberto Lucchetti","Stefano Moretti"],"meta":["April 2019Social Choice and Welfare 52(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00355-018-1161-1"],"references":["305679026_Welfare_criteria_from_choice_An_axiomatic_analysis","273104072_Ranking_sets_of_interacting_objects_via_semivalues","326203960_Ceteris_paribus_majority_for_social_ranking","320002293_Some_Axiomatic_and_Algorithmic_Perspectives_on_the_Social_Ranking_Problem","313124372_A_method_for_evaluating_the_distribution_of_power_in_a_committee_system","310512722_An_axiomatic_approach_to_social_ranking_under_coalitional_power_relations","308939145_Mutual_rankings","303920031_Weighted_voting_does_not_work_a_mathematical_analysis","284289939_A_Value_for_n-Person_Games","278619241_An_axiomatic_approach_to_social_ranking_under_coalitional_power_relations","268618593_A_Set_of_Independent_Necessary_and_Sufficient_Conditions_for_Simple_Majority_Decision","248414237_Weighted_Voting_Doesn't_Work_A_Mathematical_Analysis","228108279_A_Method_of_Evaluating_Power_in_a_Committee_System","228108271_The_Elementary_Statistics_of_Majority_Voting","228108114_Weighted_Voting_Doesn't_Work_A_Mathematical_Analysis"]}
