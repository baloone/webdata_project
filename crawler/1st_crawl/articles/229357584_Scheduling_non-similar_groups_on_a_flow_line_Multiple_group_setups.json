{"id":"229357584_Scheduling_non-similar_groups_on_a_flow_line_Multiple_group_setups","abstract":"This research addresses lead-time reduction and makespan minimization for cut and sew operations of upholstered furniture manufacturing through efficient scheduling. Jobs are grouped based on different characteristics at each operation of this two stage flow line. There are identical parallel machines at each stage and jobs proceed individually from the 1st stage to the 2nd. A heuristic for the case of multiple setups per group at the 2nd stage is developed, compared to a single setup per group at each stage, and integrated into a genetic algorithm. Results demonstrate that the heuristic effectively adds minimal setups to a single setup schedule while significantly improving schedule makespan.","authors":["A.D. Wilson","Russell E. King","Thom J.
