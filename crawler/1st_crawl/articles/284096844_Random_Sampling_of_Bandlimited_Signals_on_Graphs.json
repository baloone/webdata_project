{"id":"284096844_Random_Sampling_of_Bandlimited_Signals_on_Graphs","abstract":"We study the problem of sampling k-bandlimited signals on graphs. We propose\ntwo sampling strategies that consist in selecting a small subset of nodes at\nrandom. The first strategy is non-adaptive, i.e., independent of the graph\nstructure, and its performance depends on a parameter called the graph\ncoherence. On the contrary, the second strategy is adaptive but yields optimal\nresults. Indeed, no more than O(k log(k)) measurements are sufficient to ensure\nan accurate and stable recovery of all k-bandlimited signals. This second\nstrategy is based on a careful choice of the sampling distribution, which can\nbe estimated quickly. Then, we propose a computationally efficient decoder to\nreconstruct k-bandlimited signals from their samples. We prove that it yields\naccurate reconstructions and that it is also stable to noise. Finally, we\nconduct several experiments to test these techniques.","authors":["Gilles Puy","Nicolas Tremblay","RÃ©mi Gribonval","Pierre Vandergheynst"],"meta":["November 2015Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis 44(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.acha.2016.05.005","SourcearXiv"],"references":["282402877_Efficient_Sampling_Set_Selection_for_Bandlimited_Graph_Signals_Using_Graph_Spectral_Proxies","275364663_Signal_Recovery_on_Graphs_Random_versus_Experimentally_Designed_Sampling","275210379_Sampling_Theory_for_Graph_Signals","274012268_A_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_Sampling_Theory_of_Graph_Signals","273788318_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Sampling_Theory","273396704_Downsampling_of_Signals_on_Graphs_Via_Maximum_Spanning_Trees","272422870_Asymptotic_Justification_of_Bandlimited_Interpolation_of_Graph_signals_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning","258335840_Stable_and_Robust_Sampling_Strategies_for_Compressive_Imaging","251876635_Variable_Density_Compressed_Sensing_In_MRI_Theoretical_vs_Heuristic_Sampling_Strategies","232743728_The_Emerging_Field_of_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Extending_High-Dimensional_Data_Analysis_to_Networks_and_Other_Irregular_Domains","232735582_Compact_Support_Biorthogonal_Wavelet_Filterbanks_for_ArbitraryUndirected_Graphs","225357268_Sampling_Filtering_and_Sparse_Approximations_on_Combinatorial_Graphs","224256638_A_Novel_Sampling_Theorem_on_the_Sphere","215991418_Active_Inference_for_Collective_Classification","308840633_Asymptotic_justification_of_bandlimited_interpolation_of_graph_signals_for_semi-supervised_learning","306117118_A_statistical_perspective_of_sampling_scores_for_linear_regression","303338647_Reconstruction_algorithms_in_irregular_sampling","301874400_Compressive_Spectral_Clustering","300470061_Applied_and_computational_harmonic_analysis_on_graphs_and_networks","299671386_Spectral_Graph_Theory","290746143_-optimality_for_active_learning_on_Gaussian_random_fields","288179601_A_Multiscale_Pyramid_Transform_for_Graph_Signals","286420318_B_ook_R_eview","282000447_Subgraph-Based_Filterbanks_for_Graph_Signals","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","273706171_A_Review_of_Nystrom_Methods_for_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning","271472396_Towards_a_sampling_theorem_for_signals_on_arbitrary_graphs","269633966_Compressive_Sampling","269295007_Towards_a_Spectral_Characterization_of_Signals_Supported_on_Small-World_Networks","267515519_Trend_Filtering_on_Graphs","266352896_A_Variance_Minimization_Criterion_to_Active_Learning_on_Graphs","265575276_A_Mathematical_Introduction_to_Compressive_Sensing","264828551_Big_Data_Analysis_with_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Representation_and_processing_of_massive_data_sets_with_irregular_structure","262368151_Relative-Error_CUR_Matrix_Decompositions","261040900_Towards_Active_Learning_on_Graphs_An_Error_Bound_Minimization_Approach","260303032_A_Spectral_Graph_Uncertainty_Principle","257482071_A_survey_on_instance_selection_for_active_learning","256069999_A_Framework_for_Multiscale_Transforms_on_Graphs","243765042_Irregular_Sampling_and_Frames","242922721_Reconstruction_Algorithms_in_Irregular_Sampling","236871343_An_Analysis_of_Block_Sampling_Strategies_in_Compressed_Sensing","235891953_Revisiting_the_Nystrom_Method_for_Improved_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning","234812466_Sampling_algorithms_for_l_2_regression_and_applications","224513791_A_Simple_Proof_of_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property_for_Random_Matrices","222404885_Wavelets_on_Graphs_via_Spectral_Graph_Theory","221620483_Using_Manifold_Stucture_for_Partially_Labeled_Classification","221619829_Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections","221345182_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Using_Gaussian_Fields_and_Harmonic_Functions","220319905_Manifold_Regularization_A_Geometric_Framework_for_Learning_from_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Examples","51966446_Mysteries_around_the_graph_Laplacian_eigenvalue_4","51959192_Sampling_in_Paley-Wiener_spaces_on_combinatorial_graphs","51940786_On_Variable_Density_Compressive_Sampling","51954959_Randomized_Algorithms_for_Matrices_and_Data","51938211_Fast_Approximation_of_Matrix_Coherence_and_Statistical_Leverage","47758386_Introduction_to_the_non-asymptotic_analysis_of_random_matrices"]}
