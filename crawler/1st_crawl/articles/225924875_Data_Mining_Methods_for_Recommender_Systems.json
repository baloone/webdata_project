{"id":"225924875_Data_Mining_Methods_for_Recommender_Systems","abstract":"In this chapter, we give an overview of the main Data Mining techniques used in the context of Recommender Systems. We first\ndescribe common preprocessing methods such as sampling or dimensionality reduction. Next, we review the most important classification\ntechniques, including Bayesian Networks and Support Vector Machines. We describe the k-means clustering algorithm and discuss several alternatives. We also present association rules and related algorithms for\nan efficient training process. In addition to introducing these techniques, we survey their uses in Recommender Systems and\npresent cases where they have been successfully applied.","authors":["Xavier Amatriain","Alejandro Jaimes","Nuria Oliver","Josep M.
