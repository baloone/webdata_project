{"id":"3960189_A_privacy_policy_model_for_enterprises","abstract":"Privacy is an increasing concern in the marketplace. Although enterprises promise sound privacy practices to their customers, there is no technical mechanism to enforce them internally In this paper we describe a privacy policy model that protects personal data from privacy violations by means of enforcing enterprise-wide privacy, policies. By extending Jajodia et al.'s flexible authorization framework (FAF) with grantors and obligations, we create a privacy control language that includes user consent, obligations, and distributed administration. Conditions impose restrictions on the use of the collected data, such as modeling guardian consent and options. Access decisions are extended with obligations, which list a set of activities that must be executed together with the access request. Grantors allow to define a separation of duty between the security officer and the privacy officer.","authors":["GÃ¼nter Karjoth","Matthias Schunter"],"meta":["February 2002","DOI:10.1109/CSFW.2002.1021821","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Computer Security Foundations Workshop, 2002.
