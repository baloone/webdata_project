{"id":"302920985_Lowenheim-Skolem_theorems_for_non-classical_first-order_algebraizable_logics_Table_1","abstract":"This article is a contribution to the model theory of non-classical first-order predicate logics. In a wide framework of first-order\nsystems based on algebraizable logics, we study several notions of homomorphisms between models and find suitable definitions\nof elementary homomorphism, elementary substructure and elementary equivalence. Then we obtain (downward and upward) Lowenheim-Skolem\ntheorems for these non-classical logics, by direct proofs and by describing their models as classical two-sorted models.","authors":["Maria Pilar Dellunde","Àngel García-Cerdaña","Carles Noguera"],"meta":["May 2016Logic Journal of IGPL 24(3):jzw009","DOI:10.1093/jigpal/jzw009"],"references":["271193853_Mathematical_principles_of_fuzzy_logic","266993410_The_category_of_the_fuzzy_models_and_Lowenheim-Skolem_theorem","281131797_Algebraic_Systems","281053679_Fuzzy_Relational_Systems","280939945_Model_Theory","273900216_A_henkin-style_proof_of_completeness_for_first-order_algebraizable_logics","266936044_Axiomatizability_of_some_many_valued_predicate_calculi","266517939_Many_Sorted_Logic_and_Its_Applications","265438215_Algebraizable_Logics","262320901_Preserving_mappings_in_fuzzy_predicate_logics"]}
