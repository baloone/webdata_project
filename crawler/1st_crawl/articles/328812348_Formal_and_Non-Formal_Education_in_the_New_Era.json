{"id":"328812348_Formal_and_Non-Formal_Education_in_the_New_Era","abstract":"The recent economic crisis in Europe has reshaped the way education is perceived.\nAdmittedly, education has been considered as one of the pillars that can push Europe towards economic stability. Consequently, in recent years we have witnessed growing investments in education. The much needed money flows have made an impact,\nhowever the situation is less than ideal as many urgent problems have been overlooked and continue to prevail. Europe is facing the problem of the economization of education, not providing students with the skills of the 21st century, and the reduced quality of teaching . It is our argument that three factors which will have a positive impact include using new technologies in education, teaching digital competencies, and finally\nhighlighting learning styles preferences to engage a ll students in learning. It is the aim of this work to provide evidence that incorporating the three recommendations will result in improved education outcomes in Europe.","authors":["Arif Shala","Albulene Grajcevci"],"meta":["June 2016"],"references":["235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","232579857_The_Role_of_Achievement_Goals_in_the_Development_of_Interest_Reciprocal_Relations_Between_Achievement_Goals_Interest_and_Performance","230222142_The_Characterisation_of_Work-Based_Learning_by_Consideration_of_the_Theories_of_Experiential_Learning","263196427_Formal_to_informal_learning_with_IT_Research_challenges_and_issues_for_e-learning","257779493_A_Higher_Education_for_the_Twenty-first_Century_European_and_Us_Approaches","254410624_The_Future_of_Higher_Education_in_Europe_The_Case_for_a_Stronger_Base_in_EU_Law","253786219_Formal_non-formal_and_informal_education_Conceptsapplicability","237362322_The_Missing_Link_Link_Link_Link_in_Educational_Technology_in_Educational_Technology_in_Educational_Technology_in_Educational_Technology_T_T_T_TRAINED_RAINED_RAINED_RAINED_T_T_T_TEACHERS_EACHERS_EACHER","220663127_Computer_literacy_and_inquiry_learning_when_geeks_learn_less","201381658_From_Teaching_to_Learning_-_A_New_Paradigm_For_Undergraduate_Education"]}
