{"id":"266216568_Chromatic_Number_in_Time_O24023_n_Using_Maximal_Independent_Sets","abstract":"In this paper we improve an algorithm by Eppstein (2001) for finding the chromatic number of a graph. We modify the algorithm slightly, and by using a bound on the number of maximal independent sets of size k from our recent paper (2003), we prove that the running time is O(2.4023^n). Eppstein's algorithm runs in time O(2.4150^n). The space usage for both algorithms is O(2^n).","authors":["Jesper Makholm Byskov"],"meta":["December 2002BRICS Report Series 9(45)","DOI:10.7146/brics.v9i45.21760"],"references":["295686311_Checking_Consistency_of_Pedigree_Information_is_NP-complete_Preliminary_Report","238436980_Some_Remarks_on_Regular_Words","221350896_A_Symmetric_Approach_to_Compilation_and_Decompilation"]}
