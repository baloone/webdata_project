{"id":"222562576_Abstract_numeration_systems","abstract":"Using a genealogically ordered infinite regular language, we know how to represent an interval of . Numbers having an ultimately periodic representation play a special role in classical numeration systems. The aim of this paper is to characterize the numbers having an ultimately periodic representation in generalized systems built on a regular language. The syntactical properties of these words are also investigated. Finally, we show the equivalence of the classical θ-expansions with our generalized representations in some special case related to a Pisot number θ.","authors":["Pierre Lecomte","Michel Rigo"],"meta":["July 2004Information and Computation 192(1):57-83","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2003.12.006"],"references":["242970273_Additive_Functions_with_Respect_to_Numeration_Systems_on_Regular_Languages","230824072_Odometers_and_systems_of_numeration","227310237_Numeration_Systems_on_a_Regular_Language","220543916_Distribution_of_Additive_Functions_with_Respect_to_Numeration_Systems_on_Regular_Languages","31593969_Handbook_of_Formal_Languages","2410362_Structure_Of_Three-Interval_Exchange_Transformations_I_An_Arithmetic_Study","266405784_On_representation_of_integers_in_linear_numeration_systems","265436996_Algebraic_Combinatorics_on_Words","264929373_Systems_of_Numeration","262371638_Regular_Languages","247015328_On_Periodic_Expansions_of_Pisot_Numbers_and_Salem_Numbers","245700512_Comment_ecrire_les_nombres_entiers_dans_une_base_qui_n'est_pas_entiere","242963370_On_the_b_-expansions_of_real_numbers","242963082_Representations_for_Real_Numbers_and_Their_Ergodic_Properties","241636526_Systems_of_numeration","239666573_Developpements_en_base_de_Pisot_et_repartition_modulo_1","239061144_On_the-expansions_of_real_numbers","225539911_Numeration_systems_linear_recurrences_and_regular_sets","220543801_Greedy_Numeration_Systems_and_Regularity","220543758_On_the_Representation_of_Real_Numbers_Using_Regular_Languages","220246427_Numeration_Systems_Linear_Recurrences_and_Regular_Sets","220152006_Bertrand_Numeration_Systems_and_Recognizability","220148902_Substitutions_and_interval_exchange_transformations_of_rotation_class","1961530_Numeration_systems_on_a_regular_language_Arithmetic_operations_Recognizability_and_Formal_power_series"]}
