{"id":"258816518_An_adaptive_moving_finite_volume_scheme_for_modeling_flood_inundation_over_dry_and_complex_topography","abstract":"A new geometrical conservative interpolation on unstructured meshes is\ndeveloped for preserving still water equilibrium and positivity of water\ndepth at each iteration of mesh movement, leading to an adaptive moving\nfinite volume (AMFV) scheme for modeling flood inundation over dry and\ncomplex topography. Unlike traditional schemes involving position-fixed\nmeshes, the iteration process of the AFMV scheme moves a fewer number of\nthe meshes adaptively in response to flow variables calculated in prior\nsolutions and then simulates their posterior values on the new meshes.\nAt each time step of the simulation, the AMFV scheme consists of three\nparts: an adaptive mesh movement to shift the vertices position, a\ngeometrical conservative interpolation to remap the flow variables by\nsumming the total mass over old meshes to avoid the generation of\nspurious waves, and a partial differential equations(PDEs)\ndiscretization to update the flow variables for a new time step. Five\ndifferent test cases are presented to verify the computational\nadvantages of the proposed scheme over nonadaptive methods. The results\nreveal three attractive features: (i) the AMFV scheme could preserve\nstill water equilibrium and positivity of water depth within both mesh\nmovement and PDE discretization steps; (ii) it improved the\nshock-capturing capability for handling topographic source terms and\nwet-dry interfaces by moving triangular meshes to approximate the\nspatial distribution of time-variant flood processes; (iii) it was able\nto solve the shallow water equations with a relatively higher accuracy\nand spatial-resolution with a lower computational cost.","authors":["Feng Zhou","Guoxian
