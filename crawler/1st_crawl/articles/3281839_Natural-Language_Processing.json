{"id":"3281839_Natural-Language_Processing","abstract":"Processing natural language such as English has always been one of\nthe central research issues of artificial intelligence, both because of\nthe key role language plays in human intelligence and because of the\nwealth of potential applications. Many of the knowledge representation\nand inference techniques that have been applied successfully in\nknowledge-based systems were originally developed for processing natural\nlanguage, but the language-processing applications themselves have\nalways seemed far from being realized. The special series on\nnatural-language processing is an attempt to bring language processing\nand its applications into focus-to demonstrate techniques that have\nrecently been applied to real-world problems, to identify research ripe\nfor practical exploitation, and to illustrate some promising\ncombinations of natural-language processing with other emerging\ntechnologies. Each of the four articles in the series provides some\ninsight into the state of the art and conveys the practical significance\nof recent research in the field","authors":["T.
