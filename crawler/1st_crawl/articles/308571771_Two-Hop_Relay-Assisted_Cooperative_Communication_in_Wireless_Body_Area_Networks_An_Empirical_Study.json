{"id":"308571771_Two-Hop_Relay-Assisted_Cooperative_Communication_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_An_Empirical_Study","abstract":"The pervasive use of wireless body area networks (BANs) has incurred potential inter-BAN interference, which can cause severe performance degradation. In this article, the coexistence of BANs is experimentally performed. A relay-assisted cooperative communications scheme is implemented in a real IEEE 802.15.4-based BAN system with a beacon-enabled mode and guaranteed time slot (GTS) scheduling. As far as we know, it is the first experimental work that enables real-time investigation of the effectiveness of cooperative communications in BANs for co-channel radio interference mitigation. First- and second-order statistics, including outage probability, level crossing rate (LCR), and average fade/nonfade duration, are calculated from the measured effective channel gains of the device-to-coordinator links across all superframes. Empirical results demonstrate significant advantages of using two-hop relay-assisted communications over traditional star topology BAN. Advantages include a maximum of a 10dB increase in channel gain threshold at an outage probability of 10%, which corresponds to a guideline for a 10% maximum packet error rate as specified in the IEEE BAN standard; a reduction in the level crossing rate by a factor of 5 at a channel gain threshold of -100dB; and an average nonfade duration prolonged by a factor of 5 at the same threshold.","authors":["Jie Dong","Yu Ge","David B Smith"],"meta":["September 2016ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks 12(4):1-13","DOI:10.1145/2979679"],"references":["342947209_Performances_Enhancement_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Network_WBAN","262387154_A_Review_of_Radio_Channel_Models_for_Body_Centric_Communications","261112007_Study_of_dynamic_on-body_link_reliability_for_WBAN_systems","233937058_Opportunistic_Relaying_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_CoexistencePerformance","224579867_Compress-and-Forward_Cooperative_MIMO_Relaying_With_Full_Channel_State_Information","224368624_Transmission_Power_Control_in_Body_Area_Sensor_Networks_for_Healthcare_Monitoring","224359728_Statistical_characterization_of_the_dynamic_narrowband_body_area_channel","221420337_Experimental_Study_of_the_Impact_of_WLAN_Interference_on_IEEE_802154_Body_Area_Networks","220545517_Performance_evaluation_of_direct_and_cooperative_transmissions_in_body_area_networks","3236261_A_Simple_Cooperative_Diversity_Method_based_on_Network_Path_Selection","321572448_Ultra-Low-Power_Short-Range_Radios","311396077_User_cooperation_diversity_part_i_System_description","300474913_Channel_Modeling_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","277288686_TKN154_An_IEEE_802154_MAC_implementation_for_TinyOS","271546150_Improved_Switched_Combining_with_cooperative_diversity_for_wireless_body_area_networks_Empirical_analysis_and_theory","262343771_Are_Narrowband_Wireless_On-Body_Networks_Wide-Sense_Stationary","261459727_Inter-user_interference_in_Body_Sensor_Networks_A_case_study_in_moderate-scale_deployment_in_hospital_environment","260636610_An_Experimental_Study_for_Inter-User_Interference_Mitigation_in_Wireless_Body_Sensor_Networks","257811661_Cooperative_body-area-communications_Enhancing_coexistence_without_coordination_between_networks","241183125_An_experimental_study_on_the_impact_of_human_body_shadowing_in_off-body_communications_channels_at_245_GHz","221575553_Interference_in_Body_Area_Networks_Distance_does_not_dominate","221313066_Inter-User_Interference_in_Body_Sensor_Networks_Preliminary_Investigation_and_an_Infrastructure-Based_Solution","221091809_Understanding_the_causes_of_packet_delivery_success_and_failure_in_dense_wireless_sensor_networks","3161089_User_Cooperation_Diversity_-_Part_I_System_Description","3085253_Cooperative_Diversity_in_Wireless_Networks_Efficient_Protocols_and_Outage_Behavior","3084864_Distributed_Space-Time-Coded_Protocols_for_Exploiting_Cooperative_Diversity_in_Wireless_Networks"]}
