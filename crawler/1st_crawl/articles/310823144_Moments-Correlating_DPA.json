{"id":"310823144_Moments-Correlating_DPA","abstract":"We generalize correlation-enhanced power analysis collision attacks into moments-correlating DPA. The resulting distinguisher is applicable to the profiled and non-profiled (collision) settings and is able to exploit information lying in any statistical moment. It also benefits from a simple rule-of-thumb to estimate its data complexity. Experimental results show that such a tool allows answering with confidence to some important questions regarding the design of side-channel countermeasures (e.g. what is the most informative statistical moment in the leakages of a threshold implementation). We further argue that moments-correlating DPA is a natural candidate for leakage detection tests, enjoying the simplicity of correlation power analysis and advanced features for the evaluation of higher-order attacks with an easy-to-compute confidence level.","authors":["Amir Moradi","Fran√ßois-Xavier Standaert"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2996366.2996369","Conference: the 2016 ACM Workshop"],"references":["313593812_Towards_easy_leakage_certification_extended_version","312830140_Making_Masking_Security_Proofs_Concrete","305810802_Towards_Easy_Leakage_Certification","301670732_From_Improved_Leakage_Detection_to_the_Detection_of_Points_of_Interests_in_Leakage_Traces","300641707_Efficient_Selection_of_Time_Samples_for_Higher-Order_DPA_with_Projection_Pursuits","300546057_Blind_Source_Separation_from_Single_Measurements_Using_Singular_Spectrum_Analysis","294288844_Leakage_Assessment_Methodology","290258621_Low_Entropy_Masking_Schemes_Revisited","280051095_Unified_and_Optimized_Linear_Collision_Attacks_and_Their_Application_in_a_Non-Profiled_Setting","264915525_How_to_Certify_the_Leakage_of_a_Chip","262212701_Success_through_Confidence_Evaluating_the_Effectiveness_of_a_Side-Channel_Attack","226320515_Side-Channel_Resistant_Crypto_for_Less_than_2300_GE","225126827_Side-channel_leakage_of_masked_CMOS_gates","224242490_One_for_all_-_All_for_one_Unifying_standard_differential_power_analysis_attacks","221348261_Pushing_the_Limits_A_Very_Compact_and_a_Threshold_Implementation_of_AES","221348181_A_Unified_Framework_for_the_Analysis_of_Side-Channel_Key_Recovery_Attacks","221348095_A_Formal_Study_of_Power_Variability_Issues_and_Side-Channel_Attacks_for_Nanoscale_Devices","221327047_The_World_Is_Not_Enough_Another_Look_on_Second-Order_DPA","221291676_Correlation_Power_Analysis_with_a_Leakage_Model","221291660_PRESENT_an_ultra-lightweight_block_cipher","220335483_A_Unified_Framework_for_the_Analysis_of_Side-Channel_Key_Recovery_Attacks_extended_version","220334648_Statistical_Analysis_of_Second_Order_Differential_Power_Analysis","2997990_An_Overview_of_Power_Analysis_Attacks_Against_Field_Programmable_Gate_Arrays","322465158_Making_Masking_Security_Proofs_Concrete_Or_How_to_Evaluate_the_Security_of_Any_Leaking_Device_Extended_Version","321572953_Cryptographic_Hardware_and_Embedded_Systems_--_CHES_2015_17th_International_Workshop_Saint-Malo_France_September_13-16_2015_Proceedings","300019580_Early_Propagation_and_Imbalanced_Routing_How_to_Diminish_in_FPGAs","285671044_A_Statistical_Model_for_DPA_with_Novel_Algorithmic_Confusion_Analysis","284747163_Assessment_of_Hiding_the_Higher-Order_Leakages_in_Hardware_What_Are_the_Achievements_Versus_Overheads","277623376_A_Hardware-Based_Countermeasure_to_Reduce_Side-Channel_Leakage_Design_Implementation_and_Evaluation","266349049_Advances_in_Cryptology_-_EUROCRYPT_2011_30th_Annual_International_Conference_on_the_Theory_and_Applications_of_Cryptographic_Techniques_Tallinn_Estonia_May_15-19_2011_Proceedings","265715540_A_More_Efficient_AES_Threshold_Implementation","265533007_Statistical_Tools_Flavor_Side-Channel_Collision_Attacks","265465546_Cryptographic_Hardware_and_Embedded_Systems_-_CHES_2012_14th_International_Workshop_Leuven_Belgium_September_9-12_2012_Proceedings","264946047_Does_My_Device_Leak_Information_An_a_priori_Statistical_Power_Analysis_of_Leakage_Detection_Tests","262160569_How_far_should_theory_be_from_practice_Evaluation_of_a_countermeasure","260585404_One_attack_to_rule_them_all_Collision_timing_attack_versus_42_AES_ASIC_cores","221354811_Towards_Sound_Approaches_to_Counteract_Power-Analysis_Attacks","221337212_Practical_evaluation_of_DPA_countermeasures_on_reconfigurable_hardware","221291756_Correlation-Enhanced_Power_Analysis_Collision_Attack","221291583_Template_Attacks","221208361_Hardware_Countermeasures_against_DPA_-_A_Statistical_Analysis_of_Their_Effectiveness","220942333_A_New_Class_of_Collision_Attacks_and_Its_Application_to_DES","220479148_Secure_Hardware_Implementation_of_Nonlinear_Functions_in_the_Presence_of_Glitches"]}
