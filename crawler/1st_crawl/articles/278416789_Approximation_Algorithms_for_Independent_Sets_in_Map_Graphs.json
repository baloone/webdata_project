{"id":"278416789_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Independent_Sets_in_Map_Graphs","abstract":"This paper presents polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the problem of computing a maximum independent set in a given map graph G with or without weights on its vertices. If G is given together with a map, then a ratio of 1 + delta can be achieved by a quadratic-time algorithm for any given constant delta > 0, no matter whether each vertex of G is given a weight or not. In case G is given without a map, a ratio of 4 can be achieved by a low-degree polynomial-time algorithm if no vertex is given a weight, while a ratio of 5 can be achieved by a low-degree polynomial-time algorithm otherwise.
