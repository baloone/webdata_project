{"id":"3175853_MUSIC_maximum_likelihood_and_Cramer-Rao_bound_Further_results_and_comparisons","abstract":"The problem of determining the direction-of-arrival of narrowband\nplane waves using sensor arrays and the related problem of estimating\nthe parameters of superimposed signals from noisy measurements are\nstudied. A number of results have been recently presented by the authors\non the statistical performance of the multiple signal characterization\n(MUSIC) and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for the above\nproblems. This work extends those results in several directions. First,\nit establishes that in the class of weighted MUSIC estimators, the\nunweighted MUSIC achieves the best performance (i.e. the minimum\nvariance of estimation errors), in large samples. Next, it derives the\ncovariance matrix of the ML estimator and presents detailed analytic\nstudies of the statistical efficiency of MUSIC and ML estimators. These\nstudies include performance comparisons of MUSIC and MLE with each\nother, as well as with the ultimate performance corresponding to the\nCramer-Rao bound. Finally, some numerical examples are given which\nprovide a more quantitative study of performance for the problem of\nfinding two directions with uniform linear sensor arrays","authors":["Petre Peter Stoica","Arye Nehorai"],"meta":["January 1991IEEE Transactions on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing 38(12):2140 - 2150","DOI:10.1109/29.61541","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["304777368_Detection_and_Estimation_of_Superimposed_Signals","224737189_High_resolution_bearing_estimation_without_eigen_decomposition","3178019_An_Algorithm_for_Pole-Zero_Modeling_and_Spectral_Analysis","3177764_Detection_of_signals_by_information_theoretic_criteria","2996535_The_Application_of_Spectral_Estimation_Methods_to_Bearing_Estimation_Problems","270314048_Introduction_to_Matrix_Analysis","224682699_A_comparative_study_of_modern_eigenstructure_methods_for_bearing_estimation-A_new_high_performance_approach","50334697_Introduction_to_Matrix_Analysis","3545428_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_of_exponential_signals_in_noise_using_a_Newton_algorithm","3178146_Exact_maximum_likelihood_parameter_estimation_of_superimposed_exponential_signals_in_noise","3178134_On_the_performance_of_signal-subspace_processing--_Part_I_Narrow-band_systems","3177425_Optimality_of_high_resolution_array_processing_using_the_eigensystem_approach","3175840_Performance_study_of_conditional_and_unconditional_direction-of-arrival_estimation","3175453_MUSIC_maximum_likelihood_and_Cramer-Rao_bound","3175234_Analysis_of_the_asymptotic_relative_efficiency_of_the_MUSIC_algorithm","3016535_Multiple_Emitter_Location_and_Signal_Parameter_Estimation","3004753_Estimating_the_Angles_of_Arrival_of_Multiple_Plane_Waves"]}
