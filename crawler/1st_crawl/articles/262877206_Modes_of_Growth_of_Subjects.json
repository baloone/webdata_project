{"id":"262877206_Modes_of_Growth_of_Subjects","abstract":"We define knowledge as a system in a perpetually dynamic continuum. Knowledge grows as it is always fragmentary, though quantifying this growth is nearly impossible. Growth, inherent in the nature of knowledge, is natural, planned, and induced. S.R. Ranganathan elucidated the various modes of growth of subjects, viz. fission, lamination, loose assemblage, fusion, distillation, partial comprehensions, and subject bundles. The present study adds a few more modes of developments of subjects. We describe and fit these modes of growth in the framework of growth by specialization, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary growths. We also examine emergence of online domains such as web directories and focus on possible modes of formation of such domains. The paper concludes that new modes may emerge in the future in consonance with the new research trends and ever-changing social needs.","authors":["M.P. Satija","Devika P.
