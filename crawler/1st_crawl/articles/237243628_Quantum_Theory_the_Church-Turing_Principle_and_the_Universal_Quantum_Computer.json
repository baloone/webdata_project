{"id":"237243628_Quantum_Theory_the_Church-Turing_Principle_and_the_Universal_Quantum_Computer","abstract":"During the last few decades, an extensive development of the theory of\ncomputing machines has occurred. On an intuitive basis, a computing\nmachine is considered to be any physical system whose dynamical\nevolution takes it from one of a set of 'input' states to one of a set\nof 'output' states. For a classical deterministic system the measured\noutput label is a definite function f of the prepared input label.\nHowever, quantum computing machines, and indeed classical stochastic\ncomputing machines, do not 'compute functions' in the considered sense.\nAttention is given to the universal Turing machine, the Church-Turing\nprinciple, quantum computers, the properties of the universal quantum\ncomputer, and connections between physics and computer science.","authors":["David Deutsch"],"meta":["July 1985Proceedings of The Royal Society A Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences 400(1818)","DOI:10.1098/rspa.1985.0070"],"references":["324281216_Godel_Escher_Bach_An_Eternal_Golden_Braid","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","258070919_Black_Holes_and_Entropy","247925238_The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discover","235550343_Universal_bound_on_the_entropy_to_energy_ratio_for_bounded_systems","227106820_Quantum_Theory_as_a_Universal_Physical_Theory","223289688_Church's_Thesis_and_Principles_for_Mechanisms","222510629_On_quantum-mechanical_automata","222437908_Computation_and_Construction_Universality_of_Reversible_Cellular_Automata","50335129_Conceptual_Foundations_of_Quantum_Mechanics"]}
