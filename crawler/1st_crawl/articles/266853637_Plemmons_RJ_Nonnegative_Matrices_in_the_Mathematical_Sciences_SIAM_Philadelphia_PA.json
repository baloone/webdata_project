{"id":"266853637_Plemmons_RJ_Nonnegative_Matrices_in_the_Mathematical_Sciences_SIAM_Philadelphia_PA","abstract":"This book was first published in the Academic Press Series on Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in 1979, and went out of print over five years ago. We were encouraged to revise the original text and add supplementary material based on developments from 1979 to 1993 by several colleagues, including Gene H. Golub, who edits SIAM's Classics in Applied Mathematics series.\nSupplementary material, placed in the new Chapter 11, has been provided to survey some developments in several of the topics covered in the original volume since its completion in 1979. New material includes recent work on studying the Perron root and other eigenvalues of a nonnegative matrix, the inverse eigenvalue problem, doubly nonnegative matrices, inverse nonnegative matrices, nonnegativity and iterative methods for Markov chains, and applications of the Perronâ€“Frobenius theory to a game of numbers, and to nonnegative systems of linear and nonlinear equations. Some of the results are presented through exercises. In other cases we only give references. Due to limitations of space and time, the choice of new material added does not try to be comprehensive but rather reflects our personal interests.","authors":["Abraham Berman","Robert J.
