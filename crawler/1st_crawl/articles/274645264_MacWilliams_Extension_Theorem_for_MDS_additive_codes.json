{"id":"274645264_MacWilliams_Extension_Theorem_for_MDS_additive_codes","abstract":"The MacWilliams Extension Theorem states that each linear isometry of a\nlinear code extends to a monomial map. Unlike the linear codes, in general,\nadditive codes do not have the extension property. In this paper, an analogue\nof the extension theorem for additive codes in the case of additive MDS codes\nis proved. More precisely, it is shown that for almost all additive MDS codes\ntheir additive isometries extend to isometries of the ambient space.","authors":["Serhii Dyshko"],"meta":["April 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["229312656_The_minimum_size_of_a_finite_subspace_partition","296686806_On_Extendibility_of_Additive_Code_Isometries","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","227029996_To_the_Metrical_Rigidity_of_Binary_Codes","226760895_Blocking_sets_and_partial_spreads_in_finite_projective_spaces","225507777_On_metric_rigidity_for_some_classes_of_codes"]}
