{"id":"304065097_Road_network_emergency_accessibility_planning_after_a_major_earthquake","abstract":"In the aftermath of disasters such as major earthquakes, several roads may be blocked by rubble and the population tends to search refugee in certain gathering points of the city. Road network accessibility becomes an important issue for logistic operations, specially on the first days after the quake, when the relief distribution is crucial for survival. This study focused on the Road Emergency Rehabilitation Problem, divided into the Road Network Accessibility Problem (RNAP) and the Work-troops Scheduling Problem (WSP). The first one consists in finding traversable paths for relief teams to reach the population, and the later generates a repairing schedule to improve access to refugee areas. The contributions of this study are two-fold: we present the process of transcribing satellite imagery data into graphs, and mathematical formulations for the RNAP and WSP, along with heuristics to solve the WSP. The proposed methods are able to handle large-scale graphs in an acceptable running time for real scenarios. They are tested on simulated instances and on the graph of Port-au-Prince, with more than 10,000 vertices and edges. The Port-au-Prince graph was generated from satellite images obtained by the International Charter “Space and Major Disasters” a few hours after the 2010 earthquake.","authors":["Celso Satoshi Sakuraba","Andréa Cynthia Santos","Christian Prins","Lucie Bouillot"],"meta":["June 2016EURO Journal on Computational Optimization 4(3)","DOI:10.1007/s13675-016-0070-2","Project: Optimizing logistics for large scale disasters (OLIC)"],"references":["273649622_Kal-Haiti_A_research_database_for_risk_management_and_sustainable_reconstruction_in_Haiti","259158979_A_mathematical_model_for_post-disaster_road_restoration_Enabling_accessibility_and_evacuation","257728228_Overviews_of_Failure_Mode_and_Reconstruction_of_Road_Traffic_Facilities_in_Wenchuan_Earthquak-stricken_Areas","250382399_A_Fuzzy_Multi-objective_Model_for_Reconstructing_the_Post-quake_Road-network_by_Genetic_Algorithm","225560798_A_GRASP_metaheuristic_to_improve_accessibility_after_a_disaster","312980063_On_a_routing_problem","280950817_Relief_Distributions_Networks_A_Systematic_Review","273391583_Optimal_Scheduling_for_Highway_Emergency_Repairs_Under_Large-Scale_Supply-Demand_Perturbations","265374157_On_a_Routing_Problem","264122271_Strategies_to_optimize_the_impact_of_supplies_distribution_in_post-disaster_operations","262270844_Humanitarianemergency_logistics_models_A_state_of_the_art_overview","261038313_An_algorithm_to_prioritize_road_network_restoration_after_a_regional_event","254221774_A_time-space_network_model_for_work_team_scheduling_after_a_major_disaster","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","242562037_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_with_Graphs","241709702_Optimal_scheduling_of_logistical_support_for_an_emergency_roadway_repair_work_schedule","229387283_Optimization_models_in_emergency_logistics_A_literature_review","228602456_Highway_emergency_rehabilitation_scheduling_in_post-earthquake_72_hours","225070175_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_With_Graphs","223804937_Optimal_Scheduling_of_Emergency_Roadway_Repair_and_Subsequent_Relief_Distribution"]}
