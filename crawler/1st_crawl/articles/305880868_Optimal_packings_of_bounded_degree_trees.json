{"id":"305880868_Optimal_packings_of_bounded_degree_trees","abstract":"We prove that if $T_1,\\dots, T_n$ is a sequence of bounded degree trees so that $T_i$ has $i$ vertices, then $K_n$ has a decomposition into $T_1,\\dots, T_n$. This shows that the tree packing conjecture of Gy\\'arf\\'as and Lehel from 1976 holds for all bounded degree trees (in fact, we can allow the first $o(n)$ trees to have arbitrary degrees). Similarly, we show that Ringel's conjecture from 1963 holds for all bounded degree trees. We deduce these results from a more general theorem, which yields decompositions of dense quasi-random graphs into suitable families of bounded degree graphs. Our proofs involve Szemer\\'{e}di's regularity lemma, results on Hamilton decompositions of robust expanders, random walks, iterative absorption as well as a recent blow-up lemma for approximate decompositions.","authors":["Felix Joos","Jaehoon Kim","Daniela KÃ¼hn","Deryk Osthus"],"meta":["June 2016Journal of the European Mathematical Society 21(12)","DOI:10.4171/JEMS/909"],"references":["288890271_Packing_spanning_graphs_from_separable_families","262985496_An_approximate_version_of_the_Tree_Packing_Conjecture","236136637_Packing_Tree_Factors_in_Random_and_Pseudo-Random_Graphs","233922822_On_the_Tree_Packing_Conjecture","2827653_A_Dynamic_Survey_of_Graph_Labeling","301898305_On_the_decomposition_threshold_of_a_given_graph","301878306_Packing_minor-closed_families_of_graphs_into_complete_graphs","301648373_A_blow-up_lemma_for_approximate_decompositions","283279864_Packing_large_trees_of_consecutive_orders","273067293_Optimal_path_and_cycle_decompositions_of_dense_quasirandom_graphs","266438363_Packing_trees_of_different_order_into_K_n","266346253_Packing_and_covering_of_the_complete_graph_III_On_the_tree_packing_conjecture","265730862_Decomposing_almost_complete_graphs_by_random_trees","262947811_New_families_of_graphs_that_have_a-labelings","259438392_Almost_Every_Tree_With_m_Edges_Decomposes_K_2m2m","256392534_Balanced_integer_arrays_A_matrix_packing_theorem","248413997_Weighted_sums_of_certain_dependent_variables","238182612_An_existence_theory_for_pairwise_balanced_designs_II","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","223128265_Concentration_of_the_hypergeometric_distribution","221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","221667372_Hamilton_decompositions_of_regular_expanders_A_proof_of_Kelly's_conjecture_for_large_tournaments","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","220617576_A_Fast_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Frequencies_of_Subgraphs_in_a_Given_Graph","220357692_Packing_Trees_Into_The_Complete_Graph","220188118_Some_remarks_on_packing_trees","220186452_Packing_trees_in_complete_graphs","220078075_Packing_and_Decomposition_of_Graphs_with_Trees","220075491_An_Existence_Theory_for_Pairwise_Balanced_Designs_I_Composition_Theorems_and_Morphisms","220074561_An_Existence_Theory_for_Pairwise_Balanced_Designs_II_The_Structure_of_PBD-Closed_Sets_and_the_Existence_Conjectures","51888884_Edge-disjoint_Hamilton_Cycles_in_Random_Graphs","1754827_Hamiltonian_degree_sequences_in_digraphs"]}
