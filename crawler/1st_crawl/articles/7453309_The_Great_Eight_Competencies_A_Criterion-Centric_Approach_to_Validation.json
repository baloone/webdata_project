{"id":"7453309_The_Great_Eight_Competencies_A_Criterion-Centric_Approach_to_Validation","abstract":"The author presents results of a meta-analysis of 29 validation studies (N=4,861) that uses the Great Eight competency factors (Kurz & Bartram, 2002) as the criterion measurement framework. Predictors of the Great Eight competencies based only on personality scales show moderate to good correlations with line-manager ratings for all 8 of the competencies. On their own, ability tests correlate with 4 of the 8 competencies, and together ability and personality data yield operational validities ranging from 0.20 to 0.44 for the 8 competencies. Operational validities for aggregated predictors with aggregated criteria were estimated to be 0.53. The value of differentiating the criterion space and of relating predictor variables to criterion variables in a one-to-one fashion is discussed.","authors":["Dave Bartram"],"meta":["November 2005Journal of Applied Psychology 90(6):1185-203","DOI:10.1037/0021-9010.90.6.1185","SourcePubMed"],"references":["283803351_The_Validity_and_Utility_of_Selection_Methods_in_Personnel_Psychology_Practical_and_Theoretical_Implications_of_85_Years_of_Research_Findings","279994576_The_relative_importance_of_task_and_contextual_performance_dimensions_to_supervisor_judgments_of_overall_performance","247676965_Egoistic_and_Moralistic_Biases_in_Self-Perception_The_Interplay_of_Self-Deceptive_Styles_With_Basic_Traits_and_Motives","312947336_Personality_at_work_Criterionfocused_occupational_personality_scales_COPS_used_in_personnel_selection","304813630_Competence_at_Work_Models_for_Superior_Performance","289991952_A_Theory_of_Performance","279596409_Personality_Predictors_of_Citizenship_Performance","247843435_The_Duality_of_Human_Existence_Isolation_and_Communion_in_Western_Man","247790729_The_Big_Five_Personality_Variables_-_Construct_Confusion_Description_Versus_Prediction","247790728_The_Big_Five_Personality_Dimensions_and_Job_Performance_A_Meta-Analysis"]}
