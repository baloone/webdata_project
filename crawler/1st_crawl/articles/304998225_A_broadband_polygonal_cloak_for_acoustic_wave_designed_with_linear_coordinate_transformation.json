{"id":"304998225_A_broadband_polygonal_cloak_for_acoustic_wave_designed_with_linear_coordinate_transformation","abstract":"Previous acoustic cloaks designed with transformation acoustics always involve inhomogeneous material. In this paper, a design of acoustic polygonal cloak is proposed using linear polygonal transformation method. The designed acoustic polygonal cloak has homogeneous and anisotropic parameters, which is much easier to realize in practice. Furthermore, a possible acoustic metamaterial structure to realize the cloak is proposed. Simulation results on the real structure show that the metamaterial acoustic cloak is effective to reduce the scattering of the object.","authors":["Rongrong Zhu","Bin Zheng","Chu Ma","Jun Xu"],"meta":["July 2016The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 140(1):95-101","DOI:10.1121/1.4954762"],"references":["281111941_Experimental_Demonstration_of_Underwater_Acoustic_Scattering_Cancellation","279208442_Molding_acoustic_electromagnetic_and_water_waves_with_a_single_cloak","276399912_Cloaking_and_Invisibility_A_Review","258039296_Ray-optics_cloaking_devices_for_large_objects_in_incoherent_natural_light","253993277_A_multilayer_structured_acoustic_cloak_with_homogeneous_isotropic_materials","235576192_Experimental_demonstration_of_non-magnetic_metamaterial_cloak_at_microwave_frequencies","234974886_A_numerical_method_for_designing_acoustic_cloak_with_homogeneous_metamaterials","234890423_Acoustic_cloaking_in_three_dimensions_using_acoustic_metamaterials","232064326_Special_transformations_for_pentamode_acoustic_cloaking","231011881_An_acoustic_metafluid_Realizing_a_broadband_acoustic_cloak","230962804_Acoustic_cloaking_in_two_dimensions_A_feasible_approach","230912846_Broadband_three-dimensional_diamond-shaped_invisible_cloaks_composed_of_tetrahedral_homogeneous_blocks","221852544_Broadband_polygonal_invisibility_cloak_for_visible_light","50397335_Macroscopic_Invisibility_Cloak_for_Visible_Light","50397290_Broadband_Acoustic_Cloak_for_Ultrasound_Waves","49802725_Macroscopic_Invisibility_Cloaking_of_Visible_Light","47545087_Three-dimensional_broadband_ground-plane_cloak_made_of_metamaterials","45879893_Infrared_carpet_cloak_designed_with_uniform_silicon_grating_structure","43158548_A_Rigorous_Analysis_of_Plane-Transformed_Invisibility_Cloaks","40850867_A_near-perfect_invisibility_cloak_constructed_with_homogeneous_materials","23710551_Hiding_under_the_Carpet_A_New_Strategy_for_Cloaking","277674512_Transformation_Optics_and_Applications_in_Microwave_Frequencies","274429393_Homogeneous_Material_Constructed_Acoustic_Cloak_Based_on_Coordinate_Transformation","260645264_Three-dimensional_broadband_omnidirectional_acoustic_ground_cloak","257191290_A_feasible_approach_to_achieve_acoustic_carpet_cloak_in_air","243506045_Properties_of_a_periodically_stratified_acoustic_half-space_and_its_relation_to_a_Biot_fluid","235453809_Homogeneous_and_compact_acoustic_ground_cloaks","233395048_A_full-parameter_unidirectional_metamaterial_cloak_for_microwave","231117858_One_path_to_acoustic_cloaking","231017131_Acoustic_cloaking_and_transformation_acoustics","224392214_One-Directional_Perfect_Cloak_Created_With_Homogeneous_Material","51503573_Experimental_Acoustic_Ground_Cloak_in_Air","7053333_Pendry_J_B_Schurig_D_Smith_D_R_Controlling_electromagnetic_fields_Science_312_1780-1782","7053332_Optical_Conformal_Mapping","6742938_Metamaterial_Electromagnetic_Cloak_at_Microwave_Frequencies","5618821_Scattering_Theory_Derivation_of_a_3D_Acoustic_Cloaking_Shell","1921825_Acoustic_cloaking_theory"]}
