{"id":"355131492_Integrating_Class_Diagram_within_the_WinCASE_Tool","abstract":"Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools are very important for software engineering professionals. These tools offer great support to software developers. WinCASE tool is one of these tools. it has been improved over a period of time. Moreover, dataflow Algebra is a methodology that used to describe a formal specification of a system. The WinCASE and Dataflow Algebra were both invented in the Department of Computer Science at Sheffield University. Unified Modeling Language is a standard language for developing software systems. The Class diagram is one of the UML diagrams which demonstrates the system objects. This paper aims to enhance the WinCASE framework by integrating the Class diagram in UML notation within this framework. Therefore, this paper studied the previous work and the background of the WinCASE framework, class diagram, and Dataflow Algebra. As a result, the requirements for integrating the Class Diagram within the WinCASE framework were identified. The current WinCASE structure was analysed. Furthermore, the research method for this improvement was designed and developed.","authors":["Alhadi Klaib"],"meta":["June 2021"],"references":["328347022_Investigation_into_Indexing_XML_Data_Techniques","354020524_Data_Models_and_the_Dataflow_Algebra_within_WinCASE","268405353_Normal_Forms_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","267843247_Operations_for_Composing_Subsystems_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","267375364_Fundamental_Compositionality_Properties_of_Systems_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","266462911_A_Revised_Denotational_Semantics_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","264849244_Equality_and_Inequality_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","264848187_Basic_System_and_Subsystem_Structures_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","260319055_Properties_of_The_Synchronous_Merge_Operation_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","245839576_Dataflow_Algebras_as_Formal_Specifications_of_Data_Flows","242427042_An_Operational_Semantics_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","242426966_A_Simplified_Abstract_Syntax_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","242363489_Software_engineering_6th_edition","239724547_Executable_UML_How_to_Build_Class_Models","234756135_UML_for_the_IT_Business_Analyst_A_Practical_Guide_to_Object-Oriented_Requirements_Gathering"]}
