{"id":"260982382_Data_Warehouse_Systems_in_the_Cloud_Rise_to_the_Benchmarking_Challenge","abstract":"The most common benchmarks for cloud computing are the Terasort benchmark and the YCSB benchmark. Although these benchmarks are quite useful, they were not designed for data warehouse systems and related OLAP technologies. The most prominent benchmarks for evaluating decision support systems are the various benchmarks issued by the Transaction Processing Council (TPC), namely TPC-H and its successor TPC-DS benchmarks. TPC benchmarks mismatch cloud rationale (scalability, elasticity, pay-per-use, fault-tolerance features) and Customer Relationship Management rationale (end-user satisfaction, Quality of Service features). In this paper, we present new requirements for implementing a benchmark for data warehouse systems in the cloud. The proposed requirements aim at allowing a fair comparison of different cloud systems providersâ€™ offerings","authors":["Badir Hassan"],"meta":["December 2013International Journal of Computers and Applications 20(4):245-254"],"references":["234796809_LH_RS_---a_highly-available_scalable_distributed_data_structure","45928079_MalStone_Towards_A_Benchmark_for_Analytics_on_Large_Data_Clouds","313764223_Massive_data_analytics_in_the_cloud_TPC-H_experience_on_hadoop_clusters","290098504_Quality_of_service_for_database_in_the_cloud","220990051_Erasure_Codes_for_Increasing_the_Availability_of_Grid_Data_Storage"]}
