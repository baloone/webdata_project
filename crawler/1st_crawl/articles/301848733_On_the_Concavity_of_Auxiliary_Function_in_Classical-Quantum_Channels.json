{"id":"301848733_On_the_Concavity_of_Auxiliary_Function_in_Classical-Quantum_Channels","abstract":"The auxiliary function of a classical channel appears in two fundamental quantities that upper and lower bound the error probability, respectively. A crucial property of the auxiliary function is its concavity, which leads to several important results in finite block length analysis. In this paper, we prove that the auxiliary function of a classical-quantum channel also enjoys the same concave property, extending an earlier partial result to its full generality. The key component in our proof is a beautiful result of geometric means of operators.","authors":["Hao-Chung Cheng","Min-Hsiu Hsieh"],"meta":["February 2016IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 62(10)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2016.2598835"],"references":["266289968_On_Reliability_Function_of_Quantum_Communication_Channel","245795577_Convexity_of_the_geodesic_distance_on_spaces_of_positive_operators","233982176_Spectral_Transition_for_Random_Quantum_Walks_on_Trees","221659887_Lower_Bounds_on_the_Probability_of_Error_for_Classical_and_Classical-Quantum_Channels","29671773_Metric_convexity_of_symmetric_cones","3085950_Concavity_of_the_auxiliary_function_appearing_in_quantum_reliability_function","3080188_Reliability_function_of_general_classical-quantum_channel","315384498_Information_Theory_and_Reliable_Communication","267466833_Introduction_to_Matrix_Analysis_and_Applications","267168963_Positive_Definite_Matrices","266279152_Log-majorizations_and_norm_inequalities_for_exponential_operators","266226597_Functions_of_Matrices_Theory_and_Computation","266214903_On_the_reliability_function_for_a_quantum_communication_channel","265820700_Trace_inequalities_and_quantum_entropy_An_introductory_course","256805686_Norm_inequalities_related_to_the_matrix_geometric_mean","251482508_Some_inequalities_for_unitarily_invariant_norm","243768843_Bounds_for_the_quantity_of_information_transmitted_by_a_quantum_communication_channel","241278754_Monotonicity_of_a_relative_R'enyi_entropy","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","232718610_Concavity_of_certain_matrix_trace_and_norm_functions_II","231900161_Inequalities_between_means_of_positive_operators","227106131_Means_of_positive_linear_operators","226295859_On_an_inequality_of_Lieb_and_Thirring","223045937_Lower_bounds_to_error_probability_for_coding_on_discrete_memoryless_channels_I_II","220411114_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","200524258_Information_Theory_and_Reliable_Communication","200524170_Matrix_Analysis","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","3080941_A_Simple_Derivation_of_the_Coding_Theorem_and_Some_Applications","2591231_Strong_Converse_to_the_Quantum_Channel_Coding_Theorem"]}
