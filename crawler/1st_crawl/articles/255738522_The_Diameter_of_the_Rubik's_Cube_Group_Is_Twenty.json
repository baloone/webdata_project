{"id":"255738522_The_Diameter_of_the_Rubik's_Cube_Group_Is_Twenty","abstract":"We give an expository account of our computational proof that every position of Rubik’s Cube can be solved in 20 moves or less, where a move is defined as any twist of any face. The roughly 4·3×10 19 positions are partitioned into about two billion cosets of a specially chosen subgroup, and the count of cosets required to be treated is reduced by considering symmetry. The reduced space is searched with a program capable of solving one billion positions per second, using about one billion seconds of CPU time donated by Google. As a byproduct of determining that the diameter is 20, we also find the exact count of cube positions at distance 15.","authors":["Tom Rokicki","Herbert Kociemba","Morley Davidson","John Dethridge"],"meta":["April 2013SIAM Review 27(2):1082-1105","DOI:10.1137/120867366"],"references":["226585368_Twenty-Two_Moves_Suffice_for_Rubik's_CubeR","221564803_Twenty-six_moves_suffice_for_Rubik's_cube","227668220_Pattern_Databases","222475024_Korf_RE_Depth-first_iterative-deepening_an_optimal_admissible_tree_search_Artif_Intell_27_97-109","220430520_Linear-Time_Disk-Based_Implicit_Graph_Search","220161199_Harnessing_parallel_disks_to_solve_Rubik's_cube","2382898_Finding_Optimal_Solutions_to_Rubik's_Cube_Using_Pattern_Databases"]}
