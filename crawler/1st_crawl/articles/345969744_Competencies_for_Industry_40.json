{"id":"345969744_Competencies_for_Industry_40","abstract":"Industry 4.0 is a term that represents the radical transformation of Industry that has resulted from the integration of emerging technologies. It implies that we are witnessing the proximity of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Industry 4.0 aims to enable intelligent factories to produce personalized output utilizing greener and more efficient processes. However, to accomplish this, manufacturers must overcome several barriers, such as the lack of qualified talent to develop and manage various high-tech systems. This deficiency means that Industry 4.0 demands a change in the labor market, explicitly requiring trained professionals who have the competencies and skills to thrive in this new environment. What should a set of competencies be in the modern professional profiles? In this work, we review the required competencies, the technologies that aid in developing them, and the methods of assessing them.","authors":["Marcela Hernández de Menéndez","Ruben Morales-Menendez","Carlos A.
