{"id":"278925254_Quantum_random_walks","abstract":"We introduce the concept of quantum random walk, and show that due to quantum interference effects the average path length can be much larger than the maximum allowed path in the corresponding classical random walk. A quantum-optics application is described.","authors":["Yakir Aharonov","Liema Davidovich","N.
