{"id":"249903370_Fixed-Point_Continuation_for_l1-Minimization_Methodology_and_Convergence","abstract":"We present a framework for solving large-scale l1-regularized convex minimization problem: min |x|_1 + µf(x). Our approach is based on two powerful algorithmic ideas: operator-splitting and continuation. Operator-splitting results in a fixed-point algorithm for any given scalar µ; continuation refers to approximately following the path traced by the optimal value of x as µ increases. In this paper, we study the structure of optimal solution sets; prove finite convergence for important quantities, and establish q-linear convergence rates for the fixed-point algorithm applied to problems with f(x) convex, but not necessarily strictly convex. The continuation framework, motivated by our convergence results, is demonstrated to facilitate the construction of practical algorithms.","authors":["Elaine Thompson Hale","Wotao Yin","Yin Zhang"],"meta":["October 2008SIAM Journal on Optimization 19(3)","DOI:10.1137/070698920","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["329475599_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_Via_the_Lasso","313001335_De-noising_by_soft_thresholding","312919385_Eigenvalues_and_condition_numbers_of_random_matrices","308168354_On_the_numerical_solution_of_heat_conduction_problems_in_two_and_three_space_variables","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","304533564_Applications_of_the_method_of_multipliers_to_variational_inequalities","304496881_The_numerical_solution_of_parabolic_and_elliptic_numerical_differential_equations","292215307_Just_relax_Convex_programming_methods_for_identifying_sparse_signals_in_noise","278433201_Atomic_Decomposition_by_Basis_Pursuit","269634058_Robust_Uncertainty_Principles_Exact_Signal_Frequency_Information"]}
