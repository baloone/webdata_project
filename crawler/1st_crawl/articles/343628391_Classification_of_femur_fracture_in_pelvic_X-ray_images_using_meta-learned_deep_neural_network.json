{"id":"343628391_Classification_of_femur_fracture_in_pelvic_X-ray_images_using_meta-learned_deep_neural_network","abstract":"In the medical field, various studies using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been attempted. Numerous attempts have been made to diagnose and classify diseases using image data. However, different forms of fracture exist, and inaccurate results have been confirmed depending on condition at the time of imaging, which is problematic. To overcome this limitation, we present an encoder-decoder structured neural network that utilizes radiology reports as ancillary information at training. This is a type of meta- learning method used to generate sufficiently adequate features for classification. The proposed model learns representation for classification from X-ray images and radiology reports simultaneously. When using a dataset of only 459 cases for algorithm training, the\nmodel achieved a favorable performance in a test dataset containing 227 cases (classification accuracy of 86.78% and classification F1 score of 0.867 for fracture or normal classification). This finding demonstrates the potential for deep learning to improve performance and accelerate application of AI in clinical practice.","authors":["Changhwan Lee","Jongseong Jang","Seunghun Lee","Young Soo Kim"],"meta":["August 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-70660-4"],"references":["336906206_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","328441198_Deep_neural_network_improves_fracture_detection_by_clinicians","324019225_Automated_detection_and_classification_of_the_proximal_humerus_fracture_by_using_deep_learning_algorithm","349277064_Bidirectional_LSTM_Networks_for_Improved_Phoneme_Classification_and_Recognition","344496112_Classification_AO_des_fractures","327626122_Training_Medical_Image_Analysis_Systems_like_Radiologists_21st_International_Conference_Granada_Spain_September_16-20_2018_Proceedings_Part_I","322168436_Introduction_Fracture_and_Dislocation_Classification_Compendium-2018_International_Comprehensive_Classification_of_Fractures_and_Dislocations_Committee","322059369_Focal_Loss_for_Dense_Object_Detection","322058942_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","320572128_Few-shot_Learning_Using_a_Small-Sized_Dataset_of_High-Resolution_FUNDUS_Images_for_Glaucoma_Diagnosis"]}
