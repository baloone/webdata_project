{"id":"338281781_Instructional_Practices_for_Addressing_Computer_Science_Standards_Using_Computer_Kits_in_Preservice_Teacher_Education","abstract":"This article examines the instructional practices used to teach the computer science (CS) standard of computer devices and systems to undergraduate preservice teachers (PSTs). With computer science education (CSE) gaining an international focus, there is a need to explore a variety of instructional practices used to teach these topics. This descriptive, exploratory case study presents an examination of the instructional practices used in a CSE licensure course. In this study, the instructor utilised two commercially available computer kits to provide hands-on, learner-centred learning experiences for PSTs. PSTs perceived these kits to be valuable for learning about computing devices and systems topics and for teaching these topics in their future classrooms. Additionally, results showed that PSTs considered the usability, grade level and ability of the kits to build interest in CS when reflecting on their future use. Limitations to the instructional practices included a lack of transfer to subject areas outside of CS and a lack of focus on the integration between hardware and software.","authors":["Gamze Ozogul","Michael Karlin","Anne Ottenbreit-Leftwich","Ai-Chu Elisha Ding"],"meta":["December 2019Research on Education and Media 11(1)","DOI:10.2478/rem-2019-0004"],"references":["301716623_Computer_science_in_K-12_school_curricula_of_the_2lst_century_Why_what_and_when","292722310_A_Global_Snapshot_of_Computer_Science_Education_in_K-12_Schools","262401690_Learning_to_Teach_Computer_Science_The_Need_for_a_Methods_Course","235356393_Using_thematic_analysis_in_psychology","220017462_Enhancing_Teaching_Through_Constructive_Alignment","326919404_Preservice_Teacher_Computer_Science_Preparation_A_Case_Study_of_an_Undergraduate_Computer_Education_Licensure_Program","321512261_Those_who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","235930814_The_Coding_Manual_for_Qualitative_Research"]}
