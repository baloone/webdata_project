{"id":"239666286_Toward_a_General_Modular_Systems_Theory_and_Its_Application_to_Interfirm_Product_Modularity","abstract":"Many systems migrate towards increasing or decreasing modularity, yet no explicit causal models exist to explain this process. This paper builds a general theory of modular systems, drawing on systems research from many disciplines. This general theory is then used to derive a model of inter-firm product modularity, including testable research propositions. The latter model provides a valuable tool for predicting technological trajectories, and demonstrates how the general theory may be applied to specific systems.","authors":["Melissa A.
