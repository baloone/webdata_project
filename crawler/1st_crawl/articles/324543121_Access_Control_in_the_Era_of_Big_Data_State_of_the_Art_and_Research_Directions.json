{"id":"324543121_Access_Control_in_the_Era_of_Big_Data_State_of_the_Art_and_Research_Directions","abstract":"Confidentiality and privacy of data managed by IoT ecosystems is becoming a primary concern. This paper targets the design of a general access control enforcement mechanism for MQTT-based IoT ecosystems. The proposed approach is presented with ABAC, but other access control models can be similarly supported. The solution is based on an enforcement monitor that has been designed to operate as a proxy between MQTT clients and an MQTT server.\nThe monitor enforces access control constraints by intercepting\nand possibly manipulating the flow of exchanged MQTT control\npackets. Early experimental evaluations have overall shown low\nenforcement overhead.","authors":["Pietro Colombo","Elena Ferrari"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1145/3205977.3205986","Conference: ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies (SACMAT)At: Indianapolis, IN, USA"],"references":["322257323_Survey_on_Access_Control_for_Community-Centered_Collaborative_Systems","318168879_Cryptographically_Enforced_Role-Based_Access_Control_for_NoSQL_Distributed_Databases","318154356_Object-Tagged_RBAC_Model_for_the_Hadoop_Ecosystem","313616838_Guide_to_attribute_based_access_control_ABAC_definition_and_considerations","309893261_Access_control_in_The_Internet_of_Things_Big_challenges_and_new_opportunities","301731793_A_Policy_Framework_for_Data_Fusion_and_Derived_Data_Control","286651277_Vigiles_Fine-Grained_Access_Control_for_MapReduce_Systems","283504640_Enhancing_MongoDB_with_Purpose-Based_Access_Control","280830876_Security_Analysis_and_proposal_of_new_Access_Control_model_in_the_Internet_of_Thing","273521495_GuardMR_Fine-grained_Security_Policy_Enforcement_for_MapReduce_Systems","273461064_Efficient_Enforcement_of_Action-Aware_Purpose-Based_Access_Control_within_Relational_Database_Management_Systems","273393378_Attribute-Based_Access_Control","272946686_Significance_and_Challenges_of_Big_Data_Research","272484906_Enforcement_of_Purpose_Based_Access_Control_within_Relational_Database_Management_Systems","264561710_Privacy_Preserving_Delegated_Access_Control_in_Public_Clouds","263858533_Enforcing_Obligations_within_RelationalDatabase_Management_Systems","242503691_Object_Modeling_with_the_OCL_The_Rationale_behind_the_Object_Constraint_Language","220593619_Formal_model_and_policy_specification_of_usage_control","324543119_Access_Control_Enforcement_within_MQTT-based_Internet_of_Things_Ecosystems","322009587_Introducing_Usage_Control_in_MQTT","321809915_An_Access_Control_Framework_for_Cloud-Enabled_Wearable_Internet_of_Things","321640606_Improving_MQTT_by_Inclusion_of_Usage_Control","321403820_Internet_of_Things_Technology_Diffusion_Forecasts","321066189_Access_Control_Models_for_Virtual_Object_Communication_in_Cloud-Enabled_IoT","319637570_Implementing_Usage_Control_in_Internet_of_Things_A_Smart_Home_Use_Case","318675593_Access_Control_Model_for_AWS_Internet_of_Things","317270915_A_Datalog_Framework_for_Modeling_Relationship-based_Access_Control_Policies","314155103_Towards_a_Unifying_Attribute_Based_Access_Control_Approach_for_NoSQL_Datastores","312185385_Access_Control_Models_for_Cloud-Enabled_Internet_of_Things_A_Proposed_Architecture_and_Research_Agenda","311793099_Identity_Authentication_and_Capability_Based_Access_Control_IACAC_for_the_Internet_of_Things","311254076_Using_REST_based_protocol_to_enable_ABAC_within_IoT_systems","309900740_Distributed_capability-based_access_control_for_the_internet_of_things","303512913_Attribute_Based_Access_Control_for_Big_Data_Applications_by_Query_Modification","300358064_Attribute-Role-Based_Hybrid_Access_Control_in_the_Internet_of_Things","290989203_Towards_Virtual_Private_NoSQL_datastores","289249301_Integrating_Attributes_into_Role-Based_Access_Control","281618859_Privacy_Aware_Access_Control_for_Big_Data_A_Research_Roadmap","280113485_The_SQL_Unifying_Semi-structured_Query_Language_and_an_Expressiveness_Benchmark_of_SQL-on-Hadoop_NoSQL_and_NewSQL_Databases","277466451_A_capability-based_security_approach_to_manage_access_control_in_the_Internet_of_Things","271326273_Distributed_Capability-Based_Access_Control_for_the_Internet_of_Things","262363528_A_fine-grained_access_control_model_for_key-value_systems","262163031_A_unified_attribute-based_access_control_model_covering_DAC_MAC_and_RBAC","260324780_Multiparty_Access_Control_for_Online_Social_Networks_Model_and_Mechanisms","260305381_JSONiq_The_history_of_a_query_language","259823367_Big_Data_A_Revolution_that_Will_Transform_how_We_Live_Work_and_Think","241175767_An_extended_role_based_access_control_model_for_the_Internet_of_Things","221214739_Extending_Query_Rewriting_Techniques_for_Fine-Grained_Access_Control","220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","220696176_Access_Control_in_Data_Management_Systems","220593747_Detecting_and_resolving_policy_misconfigurations_in_Access-control_systems","220593590_Proposed_NIST_Standard_for_Role_Based_Access_Control","220473556_Purpose_Based_Access_Control_for_Privacy_Protection_in_Relational_Database_Systems","220415613_Scalable_SQL_and_NoSQL_data_stores","48205555_FENCE_Continuous_Access_Control_Enforcement_in_Dynamic_Data_Stream_Environments","27288892_The_Object_Constraint_Language_Precise_Modeling_With_UML"]}
