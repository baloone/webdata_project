{"id":"276316562_Classroom_Seating_Choice_and_Teacher_Perceptions_of_Students","abstract":"Based on research linking seating position to participation and achievement in classrooms this study investigated the impact of seat position on teachers’ initial judgments of students. Teachers were presented with a seating chart where the student’s chosen seat, sex, and grade were described. Teachers made evaluations on the basis of this information. Results indicated a significant effect for seating and a three-way interaction. Students sitting forward in the classroom are regarded more favorably than those sitting in the rear. Teachers regard males sitting in the rear and females sitting forward more positively in the early grades and less positively in the later grades than their counterparts. In addition, teacher social-communicative anxiety affects evaluations based upon seating choice. High-anxious teachers differentiate between students on the basis of seating significantly more than low-anxious teachers.","authors":["John A Daly","Amy Suite"],"meta":["January 2015The Journal of Experimental Education 50(2):64-69","DOI:10.1080/00220973.1981.11011803"],"references":["254377550_Relationship_between_vocal_activity_and_perception_of_communicators_in_small_group_interaction","248924676_The_assessment_of_social-communicative_anxiety_via_self-reports_A_comparison_of_measures","313233100_Teachers'_perceptions_Do_they_make_a_difference","275004821_Classroom_Ecology","261778004_Interpersonal_Judgments_Based_on_Talkativeness_I_Fact_or_Artifact","261777871_College_Classroom_Ecology","255578516_Teachers'_expectations_of_the_communication_apprehensive_child_in_elementary_school","249623694_Location_and_Interaction_in_Row-and-Column_Seating_Arrangements","249471623_Social_communicative_anxiety_and_the_personnel_selection_process_Testing_the_similarity_effect_in_selection_decisions","249133966_What_Teachers_Believe-What_Children_Achieve"]}
