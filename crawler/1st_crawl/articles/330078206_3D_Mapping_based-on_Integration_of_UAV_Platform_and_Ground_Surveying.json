{"id":"330078206_3D_Mapping_based-on_Integration_of_UAV_Platform_and_Ground_Surveying","abstract":"Development in aerial photogrammetry technology has contributed a notable impact to the area of large-scale mapping. Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform has become a significant tool in aerial mapping. Generating 3D mapping using photos acquired from UAV is more preferable due to its low cost and flexible operation. Therefore, this study aims to develop a technique for 3D mapping with an integration of UAV aerial photos and detailed ground survey. The produced 3D mapping has RMSE(x) = 0.279, RMSE(y) = 0.215, and RMSE (z) = 1.341 using 25 randomly selected sample points. Besides that, the result shows the location parameters i.e. x, y and z were also positively correlated, t-test(x) = 0.961, t-test(y) = 0.250 and t-test (z) = 1.885, respectively.
