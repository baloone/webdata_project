{"id":"339160459_Cross-Domain_Data_Augmentation_for_Deep-Learning-Based_Male_Pelvic_Organ_Segmentation_in_Cone_Beam_CT","abstract":"For prostate cancer patients, large organ deformations occurring between radiotherapy treatment sessions create uncertainty about the doses delivered to the tumor and surrounding healthy organs. Segmenting those regions on cone beam CT (CBCT) scans acquired on treatment day would reduce such uncertainties. In this work, a 3D U-net deep-learning architecture was trained to segment bladder, rectum, and prostate on CBCT scans. Due to the scarcity of contoured CBCT scans, the training set was augmented with CT scans already contoured in the current clinical workflow. Our network was then tested on 63 CBCT scans. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) increased significantly with the number of CBCT and CT scans in the training set, reaching 0.874 ± 0.096 , 0.814 ± 0.055 , and 0.758 ± 0.101 for bladder, rectum, and prostate, respectively. This was about 10% better than conventional approaches based on deformable image registration between planning CT and treatment CBCT scans, except for prostate. Interestingly, adding 74 CT scans to the CBCT training set allowed maintaining high DSCs, while halving the number of CBCT scans. Hence, our work showed that although CBCT scans included artifacts, cross-domain augmentation of the training set was effective and could rely on large datasets available for planning CT scans.","authors":["Jean Léger","Eliott Brion","Paul Desbordes","Christophe De Vleeschouwer"],"meta":["February 2020Applied Sciences 10(3):1154","DOI:10.3390/app10031154"],"references":["338148887_Clinical_evaluation_of_a_full-image_deep_segmentation_algorithm_for_the_male_pelvis_on_cone-beam_CT_and_CT","333594938_Deformable_image_registration_for_radiation_therapy_principle_methods_applications_and_evaluation","329964800_Usefulness_of_hybrid_deformable_image_registration_algorithms_in_prostate_radiation_therapy","323443960_Segmentation_of_the_prostate_and_organs_at_risk_in_male_pelvic_CT_images_using_deep_learning","318503747_Deformable_image_registration_in_radiation_therapy","317087807_Anatomically_Constrained_Neural_Networks_ACNN_Application_to_Cardiac_Image_Enhancement_and_Segmentation","314650740_Evaluation_of_Deformable_Image_Registration-Based_Contour_Propagation_From_Planning_CT_to_Cone-Beam_CT","331720602_Artifact-driven_sampling_schemes_for_robust_female_pelvis_CBCT_segmentation_using_deep_learning","331632352_Using_planning_CTs_to_enhance_CNN-based_bladder_segmentation_on_cone_beam_CT","318017449_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_in_Brain_Lesion_Segmentation_with_Adversarial_Networks"]}
