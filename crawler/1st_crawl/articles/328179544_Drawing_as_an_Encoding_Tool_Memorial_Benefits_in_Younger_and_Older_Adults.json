{"id":"328179544_Drawing_as_an_Encoding_Tool_Memorial_Benefits_in_Younger_and_Older_Adults","abstract":"Background/Study Context. In a recent study, drawing pictures relative to writing words at encoding has been shown to benefit later memory performance in young adults. In the current study, we sought to test whether older adultsâ€™ memory might also benefit from drawing as an encoding strategy. Our prediction was that drawing would serve as a particularly effective form of environmental support at encoding as it encourages a more detailed perceptual representation.\nMethods. Participants were presented 30 nouns, one at a time, and asked to either draw a picture or repeatedly write out the word, which was followed by a free recall test for all words (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we added an elaborative processing task in which we asked participants to list physical characteristics of the objects. In Experiment 3, we probed recognition memory for the words.\nResults. Of the words recalled in Experiment 1, a larger proportion had been drawn than written at encoding, and this effect was larger in older relative to younger adults. In Experiment 2, we demonstrated that drawing improves memory in both younger and older adults more than does an elaborative encoding task consisting of listing descriptive characteristics of the target nouns. In Experiment 3, older and younger adults drew or wrote out words at encoding, and subsequently provided Remember-Know-New recognition memory decisions. We showed that drawing reduced age-related differences in Remember responses.\nConclusions. We suggest that incorporating visuo-perceptual information into the memory trace, by drawing pictures at study, increases reliance of the memory trace on visual sensory regions, which are relatively intact in normal aging, relative to simply writing out or elaborately encoding words. Overall, results indicate that drawing is a highly valuable form of environmental support that can significantly enhance memory performance in older adults.","authors":["Melissa Meade","Jeffrey D Wammes","Myra A Fernandes"],"meta":["October 2018Experimental Aging Research 44(5):1-28","DOI:10.1080/0361073X.2018.1521432"],"references":["284672398_Age_differences_in_memory_The_roles_of_attention_and_depth_of_processing_in_new_directions_in_memory_and_aging","282658904_The_Drawing_Effect_Evidence_for_Reliable_and_Robust_Memory_Benefits_in_Free_Recall","279184372_Aging_and_Cognitive_Deficits","269281785_Recollection_not_familiarity_decreases_in_healthy_aging_Converging_evidence_from_four_estimation_methods","247605020_On_the_Transfer_of_Information_from_Temporary_to_Permanent_Memory_and_Discussion","247490812_Hopkins_Verbal_Learning_Test_Revised_Normative_Data_and_Analysis_of_Inter-Form_and_Test-Retest_Reliability","232487566_Depth_of_Processing_and_the_Retention_of_Words_in_Episodic_Memory","232485723_The_Generation_Effect_Delineation_of_a_Phenomenon","232468700_Age_Differences_in_Recall_and_Recognition","228618349_Sex_Differences_in_Episodic_Memory","227301771_The_Promise_and_Practice_of_Learner-Generated_Drawing_Literature_Review_and_Synthesis","226947681_Young_and_Older_Adults'_Expression_of_Emotional_Experience_Do_Autobiographical_Narratives_Tell_a_Different_Story","200772647_Levels_of_Processing_A_Framework_for_Memory_Research","51865476_Memory_encoding_and_aging_A_neurocognitive_perspective","51770458_Semantic_Encoding_Enhances_the_Pictorial_Superiority_Effect_in_the_Oldest-Old","51742778_Multisensory_integration_across_the_senses_in_young_and_old_adults","51424785_Pictorial_superiority_effects_in_oldest-old_adults","49792410_A_propositional_theory_of_recognition_memory","44569246_The_Production_Effect_Delineation_of_a_Phenomenon","23670566_Age-Related_Changes_in_the_use_of_Study_Context_to_Increase_Recollection","320819661_Creating_a_Recollection-Based_Memory_Through_Drawing","318850072_Learning_terms_and_definitions_Drawing_and_the_role_of_elaborative_encoding","316991409_Mini-Mental_State_A_practical_method_for_grading_the_cognitive_state_of_patients_for_the_clinician","292153279_The_d-Prime_Directive_Assessing_Costs_and_Benefits_in_Recognition_by_Dissociating_Mixed-List_False_Alarm_Rates","279300101_Contributions_of_attention_and_elaboration_to_associative_encoding_in_young_and_older_adults","278853599_Receiver-Operating_Characteristics_in_Recognition_Memory_Evidence_for_a_Dual-Process_Model","277684999_A_Standardized_Set_of_260_Pictures_Norms_for_Name_Agreement_Image_Agreement_Familiarity_and_Visual_Complexity","277494717_The_Effects_of_Age_on_the_Neural_Correlates_of_Episodic_Encoding","273114316_Imagery_and_Verbal_Processes","254033739_The_Adaptive_and_Strategic_Use_of_Memory_By_Older_Adults_Evaluative_Processing_and_Value-Directed_Remembering","247436044_Review_of_Elements_of_episodic_memory","247341969_Picture_superiority_in_free_recall_Imagery_or_dual_coding","239666004_Separating_the_Sheep_from_the_Goats_Differentiating_Global_Categories","237095733_The_Production_Effect_Costs_and_Benefits_in_Free_Recall","236603876_Rethinking_Familiarity_RememberKnow_Judgments_in_Free_Recall","232594748_Analysis_of_Rehearsal_Processes_in_Free_Recall","232586271_Age_Differences_in_Incidental_Learning","232566331_Recognizing_The_judgment_of_previous_occurrence","232529243_Why_are_Pictures_Easier_to_Recall_than_Words","232489015_Ecphoric_processes_in_recall_and_recognition","230876639_Models_for_Free_Recall_and_Recognition","228062215_Cognitive_training-related_changes_in_hippocampal_activity_associated_with_recollection_in_older_adults","224972880_Multisensory_Integration_and_Aging","222655639_The_Nature_of_Recollection_and_Familiarity_A_Review_of_30_Years_of_Research","222637935_Effects_of_orienting_tasks_on_free_recall_in_incidental_learningDifficultyeffort_and_process_explanations","222306659_The_Relation_between_Remembering_and_Knowing_as_Bases_for_Recognition_Effects_of_Size_Congruency","222086593_Sensory_factors_in_memory_for_subject-performed_tasks","220107048_External_Cognition_How_do_Graphical_Representations_Work","41428755_Recognition_memory_Adding_a_response_deadline_eliminates_recollection_but_spares_familiarity","23233335_Environmental_Support_An_Integrative_Framework","18426957_Visual_Imagery_Differences_in_the_Recall_of_Pictures","21138408_Memory_And_Aging_4_Hypotheses_In_Search_Of_Data","20761013_Age_Differences_in_Memory_for_Concrete_and_Abstract_Pictures","20573433_Generation_and_elaboration_in_older_adults","19221201_The_Generation_Effect_and_Reality_Monitoring_Evidence_From_Dementia_and_Normal_Aging"]}
