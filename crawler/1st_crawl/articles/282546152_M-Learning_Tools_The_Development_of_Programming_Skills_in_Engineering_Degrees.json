{"id":"282546152_M-Learning_Tools_The_Development_of_Programming_Skills_in_Engineering_Degrees","abstract":"This paper presents an experience based on the use of m-learning in higher education. The application developed aims at learning control sentences in structured programming languages. The objective of this experience is to determine the degree of acceptance and use of Educational Apps for mobile devices among our students, and the perception they have of how this kind of tools helps them to reach their learning goals. The application offers learning activities to students and allows teachers to monitor the students’ work and detect the programming structures where they find more difficulties. Students receive immediate feedback about their work.","authors":["Octavio Ortiz","Pedro María Alcover","Francisco Ledesma","Juan Ángel Pastor Franco"],"meta":["August 2015Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje 10(3):1-1","DOI:10.1109/RITA.2015.2452531","Project: Desarrollo de TICs para el mejoramiento de los Procesos de Enseñanza-Aprendizaje"],"references":["266797994_Studio-based_learning_via_wireless_notebooks_A_case_of_a_Java_programming_course","261078201_Mobile_devices_supported_learning_for_novice_programmers","228620263_Video_Game-Based_Education_in_Mechanical_Engineering_A_Look_at_Student_Engagement","228344427_The_current_perspectives_theories_and_practices_of_mobile_learning","299289957_World_TelecommunicationICT_Indicators_database","286784279_The_slow-motion_mobile_campus","261430819_Mobile_devices_in_computer_programming_lectures_Are_CS_lecturers_prepared_for_mobile_learning","261335634_Designing_interfaces_in_a_mobile_environment_An_implementation_on_a_programming_language","257171161_An_Investigation_of_Mobile_Learning_Readiness_in_Higher_Education_Based_on_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","228010691_Research_trends_in_mobile_and_ubiquitous_learning_A_review_of_publications_in_selected_journals_from_2001_to_2010"]}
