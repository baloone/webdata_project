{"id":"332188323_Kripke_completeness_of_strictly_positive_modal_logics_over_meet-semilattices_with_operators","abstract":"Our concern is the completeness problem for spi-logics, that is, sets of im- plications between strictly positive formulas built from propositional variables, conjunc- tion and modal diamond operators. Originated in logic, algebra and computer science, spi-logics have two natural semantics: meet-semilattices with monotone operators provid- ing Birkhoff-style calculi, and first-order relational structures (aka Kripke frames) often used as the intended structures in applications. Here we lay foundations for a complete- ness theory that aims to answer the question whether the two semantics define the same consequence relations for a given spi-logic.","authors":["Michael Zakharyaschev","A.
