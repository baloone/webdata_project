{"id":"274356466_Submarine_Cable_Kink_Analysis","abstract":"Cable kink is well recognized as a significant problem in use of submarine cables. Cable kink occurs when a cable loop forms due to torsion and tension action, and then tightens under subsequent tension increase. However, few investigations have been reported on this cable kink phenomenon. The relation between cable mechanical properties and cable kink has not been clarified. This paper reports the results of studies on cable kink phenomenon using potential energy method. It was made clear that cable kink occurs when cable deformation changes from torsional deformation to bending deformation. Results also revealed that cable kink phenomenon is controlled by only four parameters; cable slack, cable twist, cable diameter and ratio of bending rigidity to torsional rigidity.","authors":["Tetsuro Yabuta"],"meta":["September 1984Bulletin of the JSME 27(231):1821-1828","DOI:10.1299/jsme1958.27.1821","Project: NTT Laboratory"],"references":[]}
