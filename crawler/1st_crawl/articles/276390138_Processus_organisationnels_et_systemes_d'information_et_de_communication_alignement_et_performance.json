Two IS-organizational processes alignment types are considered : coordination-oriented and control-oriented. To test our model, we have used data collected due to a multi-sector survey conducted within 351 European firms. Our findings stipulate that both of the two alignment types contribute to shape the global alignment perceived in the organization. Nevertheless, the first alignment type (organic alignment) is related to higher levels of performance than the second one (mechanistic alignment).","authors":["Hajer Kefi"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.3917/rsg.251.0189","Project: Strategic Alignment"],"references":["320042341_A_Dynamic_Capabilities_Approach_to_Understanding_the_Impact_of_IT-Enabled_Businesses_Processes_and_IT-Business_Alignment_on_the_Strategic_and_Operational_Performance_of_the_Firm","287164327_Information_Technology_Investments_and_Firms'_Performance_-_A_Duopoly_Perspective","319394845_Sensemaking_in_Organizations","315412338_Les_conditions_strategiques_pour_une_meilleure_allocation_des_ressources_dans_les_techniques_de_l'information_TI_Cas_de_l'echange_de_donnees_informatiques_EDI_dans_le_secteur_des_equipementiers_de_l'a","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","312818206_Designing_complex_organizations_Reading_MA_Addison-WesleyGrant_R_1996_Toward_a_knowledge_based_theory_of_the_firm","308054428_The_concept_of_fit_in_contingency_theory","302561367_The_Concept_of_Fit_in_Strategy_Research_Toward_Verbal_and_Statistical_Correspondence","287100920_Management_in_the_1980's","272550279_Organization_Technology_and_Organization_Structure"]}
