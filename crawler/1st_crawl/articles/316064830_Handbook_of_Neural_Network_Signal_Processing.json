{"id":"316064830_Handbook_of_Neural_Network_Signal_Processing","abstract":"The use of neural networks is permeating every area of signal processing. They can provide powerful means for solving many problems, especially in nonlinear, real-time, adaptive, and blind signal processing. The Handbook of Neural Network Signal Processing brings together applications that were previously scattered among various publications to provide an up-to-date, detailed treatment of the subject from an engineering point of view. The authors cover basic principles, modeling, algorithms, architectures, implementation procedures, and well-designed simulation examples of audio, video, speech, communication, geophysical, sonar, radar, medical, and many other signals. The subject of neural networks and their application to signal processing is constantly improving. You need a handy reference that will inform you of current applications in this new area. The Handbook of Neural Network Signal Processing provides this much needed service for all engineers and scientists in the field.","authors":["Luma Naji Mohammed Tawfiq","Yu Hen Hu","JENQ-NENG HWANG"],"meta":["June 2002The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 111(6)","DOI:10.1121/1.1480419","Publisher: CRC Press LLC"],"references":["267669769_Continuous_signals_and_systems_with_MATLAB","259277596_Higher-Order_Numerical_Methods_for_Transient_Wave_Equations","243525742_Auditory_Sound_Transmission_An_Autobiographical_Perspective","2554526_Technische_Universiteit_Eindhoven"]}
