{"id":"337242492_LncTarD_a_manually-curated_database_of_experimentally-supported_functional_lncRNA-target_regulations_in_human_diseases","abstract":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with human diseases. Although lncRNA-disease associations have received significant attention, no online repository is available to collect lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, key downstream targets, and important biological functions driven by disease-related lncRNAs in human diseases. We thus developed LncTarD (http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/LncTarD/ or http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/LncTarD), a manually-curated database that provides a comprehensive resource of key lncRNA-target regulations, lncRNA-influenced functions, and lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms in human diseases. LncTarD offers (i) 2822 key lncRNA-target regulations involving 475 lncRNAs and 1039 targets associated with 177 human diseases; (ii) 1613 experimentally-supported functional regulations and 1209 expression associations in human diseases; (iii) important biological functions driven by disease-related lncRNAs in human diseases; (iv) lncRNA-target regulations responsible for drug resistance or sensitivity in human diseases and (v) lncRNA microarray, lncRNA sequence data and transcriptome data of an 11 373 pan-cancer patient cohort from TCGA to help characterize the functional dynamics of these lncRNA-target regulations. LncTarD also provides a user-friendly interface to conveniently browse, search, and download data. LncTarD will be a useful resource platform for the further understanding of functions and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA deregulation in human disease, which will help to identify novel and sensitive biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","authors":["Hongying Zhao","Jian Shi","Yunpeng Zhang","Aimin Xie"],"meta":["November 2019Nucleic Acids Research 48(D1)","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkz985"],"references":["328838814_Lnc2Cancer_v20_updated_database_of_experimentally_supported_long_non-coding_RNAs_in_human_cancers","328662468_LncRNA2Target_v20_a_comprehensive_database_for_target_genes_of_lncRNAs_in_human_and_mouse","328612342_LNCipedia_5_towards_a_reference_set_of_human_long_non-coding_RNAs","328104518_LncRNADisease_20_an_updated_database_of_long_non-coding_RNA-associated_diseases","327703253_Long_non-coding_RNAs_in_esophageal_cancer_molecular_mechanisms_functions_and_potential_applications","321765497_SNHG16miR-140-5p_axis_promotes_esophagus_cancer_cell_proliferation_migration_and_EMT_formation_through_regulating_ZEB1","327727446_Systematic_identification_of_lincRNA-based_prognostic_biomarkers_by_integrating_lincRNA_expression_and_copy_number_variation_in_lung_adenocarcinoma_lincRNA-based_prognostic_biomarkers_and_lung_adenoca","326853469_Long_noncoding_RNA_GAS5_regulates_the_proliferation_migration_and_invasion_of_glioma_cells_by_negatively_regulating_miR-18a-5p","325380239_Long_noncoding_RNA_GAS5_suppresses_triple_negative_breast_cancer_progression_through_inhibition_of_proliferation_and_invasion_by_competitively_binding_miR-196a-5p","322853413_Database_resources_of_the_National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information"]}
