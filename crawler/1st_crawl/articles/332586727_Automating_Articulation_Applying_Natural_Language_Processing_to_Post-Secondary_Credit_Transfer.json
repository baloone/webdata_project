{"id":"332586727_Automating_Articulation_Applying_Natural_Language_Processing_to_Post-Secondary_Credit_Transfer","abstract":"Within the field of post-secondary student mobility, the assessment, and evaluation of transfer credit is a labor-intensive human intelligence task that is subject to time limits and human bias. This paper introduces a semi-automated approach to assessing transfer credit and generating articulation agreements between post-secondary institutions using natural language processing (NLP). The output from the NLP system is tested using a content expert generated an assessment of transfer credit between computer science programs at two separate post-secondary institutions. Initial testing with an unsupervised NLP algorithm, despite good results against standardized measures, assessed the percentage of course overlap as 71% similar to the percentages selected by human content experts. The application of an algorithm based on the Word2Vec model using domain-specific Wikipedia corpus and dependency parsing was applied to compensate for domain specific language and improved the relationship between content experts ratings and NLP output to 86% related overlap.","authors":["Andrew Heppner","Atish Pawar","Daniel Kivi","Vijay Mago"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access 7:48295-48306","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2910145","Project: Automated Gap Analysis of Learning Outcomes"],"references":["323217416_Calculating_the_similarity_between_words_and_sentences_using_a_lexical_database_and_corpus_statistics","320891073_Wider_and_Deeper_Cheaper_and_Faster_Tensorized_LSTMs_for_Sequence_Learning","320597233_Wider_and_Deeper_Cheaper_and_Faster_Tensorized_LSTMs_for_Sequence_Learning","307558687_Siamese_Recurrent_Architectures_for_Learning_Sentence_Similarity","273067823_Improved_Semantic_Representations_From_Tree-Structured_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks","264629983_The_Meaning_Factory_Formal_Semantics_for_Recognizing_Textual_Entailment_and_Determining_Semantic_Similarity","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","319770220_Bag_of_Tricks_for_Efficient_Text_Classification","301408986_Illinois-LH_A_Denotational_and_Distributional_Approach_to_Semantics","264638135_Deciphering_Articulation_and_StateSystem_Policies_and_Agreements"]}
