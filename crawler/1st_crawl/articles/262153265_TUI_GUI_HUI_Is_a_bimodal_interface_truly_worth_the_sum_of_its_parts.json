{"id":"262153265_TUI_GUI_HUI_Is_a_bimodal_interface_truly_worth_the_sum_of_its_parts","abstract":"This study aims to explore the relative differences in efficacy of three different computer programming interfaces for controlling robots designed for early childhood education. A sample of N=36 kindergarten students from 3 different classrooms participated in this research. Each classroom was randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: a tangible user interface, a graphical user interface, and a hybrid user interface. Comparisons between the three conditions focus on which interface yields better understanding of the programming concepts taught. Implications for designing developmentally appropriate computer programming interfaces for early childhood education are discussed.","authors":["Amanda Strawhacker","Amanda Sullivan","Marina U.
