{"id":"303823336_Towards_a_Meta-Model_for_Networked_Enterprise","abstract":"To deal with challenges as globalization and fast-changing environments, enterprises are progressively collaborating with others and becoming a Networked Enterprise (NE). In this context, Enterprise Interoperability (EI) is a crucial requirement that needs to be verified by enterprises when starting a relationship to avoid interoperability problems. The concepts of NE and EI are not easy to understand due the variety of interpretations that exist in the literature. Having a clear and shared understanding of the NE and the different interoperations between partners is a necessity to manage the interoperability development. In order to reach such an objective, this research work defines a meta-model for NE based on a systemic approach. Concepts related to EI are taken into account to highlight the importance of this ability (i.e. Interoperability), seen as a requirement, within a system to attain its targeted goals. Finally, a real case study is proposed to validate the defined meta-model.","authors":["Gabriel Da Silva Serapiao Leal","Wided Guédria","Hervé Panetto","Henderik Alex Proper"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-39429-9_26","Conference: Exploring Modelling Methods for Systems Analysis and Design (EMMSAD’16)At: Ljubljana, SloveniaVolume: Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing.","Project: Decision Support for Interoperability Readiness in Networked Enterprise"],"references":["324366344_La_theorie_du_systeme_general_Theorie_de_la_modelisation","279428237_Modeling_of_Collaborative_Enterprises_-_CSFs_Driven_High-Level_Requirements","271272889_Requirements_Engineering","271263470_Enterprise_Modeling_in_the_context_of_Enterprise_Engineering_State_of_the_art_and_outlook","265923135_The_Interoperability_Score","263203151_Extending_the_Ontology_of_Enterprise_Interoperability_OoEI_Using_Enterprise-as-System_Concepts","259645095_The_Alignment_of_Business_Model_and_Business_Operations_within_Networked-Enterprise_Environments","259593026_Research_Methodology_for_Enterprise_Interoperability_Architecture_Approach","257001845_The_application_of_interoperability_requirement_specification_and_verification_to_collaborative_processes_in_industry","257001777_Formal_measures_for_semantic_interoperability_assessment_in_cooperative_enterprise_information_systems","256388461_A_Model_of_Collaborative_Enterprise_Networks","248186064_Typological_issues_in_enterprise_networks","240319008_The_Levels_of_Conceptual_Interoperability_Model","220920551_An_Approach_for_Enterprise_Interoperability_Measurement","220832435_Interoperability_in_Collaborative_Processes_Requirements_Characterisation_and_Proof_Approach","220831485_Interoperability_Maturity_Models_-_Survey_and_Comparison","220830607_Maturity_Model_as_Decision_Support_for_Enterprise_Interoperability","201168946_Design_Science_in_Information_Systems_Research","38144620_Governing_mobile_service_innovation_in_co-evolving_value_networks","37933517_Anatomy_of_Enterprise_Collaborations","29647817_Towards_a_Classification_Framework_for_Interoperability_of_Enterprise_Applications","29601405_The_basics_of_interoperability_a_curricula","29601338_The_Unified_Enterprise_Modelling_Language_-_Overview_and_further_work","4356790_Governing_Mobile_Service_Innovation_in_Converging_Value_Networks","313644269_Framework_for_enterprise_interoperability","300198795_Ecosystem_for_Virtual_Enterprise","291375366_The_extended_enterprise_a_decade_later","291242696_Which_Collaboration_Strategy_for_the_Networked_Enterprise_in_Wine_Industry_Technological_and_Organizational_Challenges","273556401_Reconfiguring_the_Value_Network","267163847_A_Systemic_approach_to_Interoperability_formalization","259593022_MMEI_Maturity_Model_for_Enterprise_Interoperability","256852152_Design_Science_in_Information_Systems_Research","235720362_Design_of_Enterprise_Systems_Theory_Architecture_and_Methods","235363021_General_System_Theory_Foundations_Development_Applications","233481935_Models_of_Complex_Enterprise_Networks","228595306_Organisational_Interoperability_Maturity_Model_for_C2","227670343_Framework_for_Enterprise_Interoperability","225235499_The_CIMOSA_Languages","223381862_Business_processes_oriented_heterogeneous_systems_integration_platform_for_networked_enterprises","222400054_Networked_enterprise_A_new_business_model_for_global_sourcing","222374616_GRAI_integrated_methodology_and_its_mapping_onto_generic_enterprise_reference_architecture_and_methodology","220833015_Ecosystem_For_Virtual_Enterprise","220694720_Requirements_Engineering","220594383_Towards_a_Systemic_Formalisation_of_Interoperability","220384416_Collaborative_networked_organizations_-_Concepts_and_practice_in_manufacturing_enterprises","200025939_General_System_Theory_Foundations_Development_Applications","44939624_Design_Science_Research_in_Europe","3985780_Modelling_networked_enterprises"]}
