{"id":"222215471_The_root-MUSIC_algorithm_for_direction_finding_with_interpolated_arrays","abstract":"This paper presents a direction finding technique which uses the outputs of a virtual array, computed from the real array using a linear interpolation procedure over a given sector. The geometry of the virtual array is under the control of the designer. By using a linear virtual array, the root-MUSIC algorithm can be applied, even though the real array may have an arbitrary geometry. The root-MUSIC algorithm offers several advantages over the MUSIC algorithm, including significantly reduced computational requirements. Various issues related to the design of the interpolated array are discussed. The performance of the algorithm was tested by extensive simulations and was found to equal the performance of the MUSIC algorithm applied to the real array. Thus, the interpolation procedure does not introduce any performance degradation.","authors":["Benjamin Friedlander"],"meta":["January 1993Signal Processing 30(1):15-29","DOI:10.1016/0165-1684(93)90048-F"],"references":["234487726_Nonlinear_spectral_analysis_and_adaptive_array_superresolution_techniques","224738724_Improving_the_resolution_performance_of_eigenstructure-based_direction-finding_algorithms","224657491_Sector_interpolation_of_non-uniform_arrays_for_efficient_high_resolution_bearing_estimation","3175906_Focused_Wide-Band_Array_Processing_by_Spatial_Resampling","3175839_A_sensitivity_analysis_of_the_MUSIC_algorithm","3175614_Performance_analysis_of_root-MUSIC","3016535_Multiple_Emitter_Location_and_Signal_Parameter_Estimation","3002040_Direction_Finding_Using_Spatial_Smoothing_With_Interpolated_Arrays"]}
