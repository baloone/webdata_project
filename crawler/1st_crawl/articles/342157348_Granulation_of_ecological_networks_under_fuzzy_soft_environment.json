{"id":"342157348_Granulation_of_ecological_networks_under_fuzzy_soft_environment","abstract":"The main idea of this work is the exploration of granular structures by applying the hybrid models of fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy soft graphs to discuss the indiscernibility partition of set of universe. The information granulation is examined by applying fuzzy soft theory, and the corresponding behavior of granules is reviewed. This article proposes a novel technique of formation of granular structures using fuzzy soft graphs and defines the fuzzy soft granules. Two degree-based models are introduced to explore the abstraction of these granular structure. Then, we use these two degree-based models to granulate the certain relationships between different species in an ecological system. Further, we develop and implement some algorithms of our proposed models to granulate the underconsideration networks. Finally, a comprehensive comparison of our proposed model with other existing techniques is presented to prove the applicability and effectiveness of fuzzy soft granulation.","authors":["Muhammad Akram","Anam Luqman"],"meta":["August 2020Soft Computing 24(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-020-05083-4"],"references":["337616627_A_new_method_for_prediction_of_air_pollution_based_on_intelligent_computation","334546808_Multi_Objectives_Optimization_to_Gas_Flaring_Reduction_from_Oil_Production","333715318_Multi-criteria_group_decision_making_based_on_ELECTRE_I_method_in_Pythagorean_fuzzy_information","333567168_Granulation_of_Hypernetwork_Models_under_the_q-Rung_Picture_Fuzzy_Environment","332357642_A_nifty_collaborative_analysis_to_predicting_a_novel_tool_DRFLLS_for_missing_values_estimation","332191857_An_m-Polar_Fuzzy_Hypergraph_Model_of_Granular_Computing","329194931_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_filter_theory_on_residuated_lattices","345464414_Hybrid_Soft_Computing_Models_Applied_to_Graph_Theory","338982481_Fuzzy_Hypergraphs_and_Related_Extensions","331988015_Hesitant_fuzzy_N-soft_sets_A_new_model_with_applications_in_decision-making","327962421_Novel_decision-making_method_based_on_bipolar_neutrosophic_information","326422721_A_fuzzy_hierarchy-based_pattern_matching_technique_for_melody_classification","327734765_Fuzzy_N-Soft_Sets_A_Novel_Model_with_Applications","326848879_Another_View_on_Generalized_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Related_Multiattribute_Decision_Making_Methods","326712925_Group_Decision-Making_Methods_Based_on_Hesitant_N_-Soft_Sets"]}
