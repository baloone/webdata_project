Two blocking models are taken into account: full blocking probability and\npartial blocking probability. As the problem is NP-hard, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation with two variants (each for a blocking model) to search for the optimal solution and several efficient adaptive heuristic algorithms to compute approximated solutions. In particular, instead of using light-trees, both ILP and heuristics use light-hierarchy, a recently proposed optimal route under sparse splitting configurations. Extensive simulations reveal that our adaptive algorithms are able to compute near-optimal solutions, and they outperform static approaches under both blocking probability models. The results also show that it is more advantageous to provision multiple multicast communications with light-hierarchies, since they are able to accommodate more requests and destinations compared to the light-tree solutions.","authors":["Le Dinh Danh","Fen Zhou","Miklos Molnar"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Optical Communications and Networking 7(1):36â€“48","DOI:10.1364/JOCN.7.000036"],"references":["268008030_Hierarchies_to_Solve_Constrained_Connected_Spanning_Problems","235745005_An_Improved_Multicast_Routing_Algorithm_in_Sparse_Splitting_WDM_Networks","273621227_Cisco_Visual_Networking_Index_Forecast_adn_Methodology_2013_-_2018","263766135_Cost-Effective_Implementation_of_Multicasting_in_Wavelength-Routed_Networks","260357456_Efficient_Resource_Allocation_for_All-Optical_Multicasting_Over_Spectrum-Sliced_Elastic_Optical_Networks","249329779_Performance_Analysis_of_Multicast_Traffic_over_Spectrum_Elastic_Optical_Networks","242327080_An_approximate_solution_of_the_Steiner_problem_in_graphs","241171214_Routing_and_wavelength_assignment_computed_jointly_for_a_given_set_of_multicast_trees_reduces_the_total_wavelength_conversion","226921679_Layered-routing_approach_for_solving_multicast_routing_and_wavelength_assignment_problem","226234189_Allocation_of_Splitting_Nodes_in_All-Optical_Wavelength-Routed_Networks"]}
