{"id":"315525747_High-Order_Synchrosqueezing_Transform_for_Multicomponent_Signals_Analysis_-_With_an_Application_to_Gravitational-Wave_Signal","abstract":"This paper puts forward a generalization of the short-time Fourier-based synchrosqueezing transform using a new local estimate of instantaneous frequency. Such a technique enables not only to achieve a highly concentrated time-frequency representation for a wide variety of amplitude- and frequency-modulated multicomponent signals but also to reconstruct their modes with a high accuracy. Numerical investigation on synthetic and gravitational-wave signals shows the efficiency of this new approach.","authors":["Duong Hung Pham","Sylvain Meignen"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSP.2017.2686355","Project: ASTRES"],"references":["312640653_On_Demodulation_Ridge_Detection_and_Synchrosqueezing_for_Multicomponent_Signals","312102388_Statistical_analysis_of_synchrosqueezed_transforms","293886905_Observation_of_Gravitational_Waves_from_a_Binary_Black_Hole_Merger","271726004_Second-Order_Synchrosqueezing_Transform_or_Invertible_Reassignment_Towards_Ideal_Time-Frequency_Representations","312100089_Heart_beat_classification_from_single-lead_ECG_using_the_synchrosqueezing_transform","311505896_Sleep_Apnea_Detection_Based_on_Thoracic_and_Abdominal_Movement_Signals_of_Wearable_Piezo-Electric_Bands","303517833_Improving_the_readability_of_time-frequency_and_time-scale_representations_by_the_reassignment_method","303517604_Analysis_of_time-varying_signals_with_small_em_BT_values","283303437_Theoretical_Analysis_of_the_Second-order_Synchrosqueezing_Transform","280243431_ConceFT_Concentration_of_Frequency_and_Time_via_a_multitapered_synchrosqueezed_transform"]}
