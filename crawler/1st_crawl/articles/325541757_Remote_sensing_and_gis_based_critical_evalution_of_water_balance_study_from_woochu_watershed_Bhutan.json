Interpretation techniques are used to identify the drainage and soil information by applying both pre- interpretation, ground truth and post visual interpretation of the satellite image layers are prepared .The interpreted maps Topology is created by linking the spatial data file and attribute data file and using SCS-CN Method Analysis of water balance study has been carried for meet the feature.","authors":["S.S.
