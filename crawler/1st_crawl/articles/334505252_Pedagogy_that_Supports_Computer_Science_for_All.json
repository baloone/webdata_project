{"id":"334505252_Pedagogy_that_Supports_Computer_Science_for_All","abstract":"The Computer Science (CS) for All movement has taken hold of the United States and CS education is rapidly expanding across nations throughout the world. Yet, as curricula and professional development opportunities are developed, key questions remain about what “works” for engaging youth in CS education, especially those who are historically underrepresented in the field (including young women, students of color, low-income students). In response, this study answers the questions: What teaching practices do students—who are historically underrepresented in CS—believe are most effective for engaging their interest in CS learning? What pedagogical actions do CS teachers identify as most effective for engaging students? And what do these engaging teaching practices look like in the classroom? Through a qualitative study following three different urban high school Exploring Computer Science classrooms over an entire school year (n = 70 students, 3 teachers; >105h of observation data; >50 interviews with students and teachers), key pedagogical practices that had greatest impact on youth's interest and engagement with CS included: (1) demystifying CS by showing its connections to everyday life; (2) addressing social issues impacting both CS and students’ communities; and (3) valuing students’ voices and perspectives. This article shares testimonies from students and teachers, as well as examples of these teaching practices in the classroom.","authors":["Jean Ryoo"],"meta":["July 2019ACM Transactions on Computing Education 19(4):1-23","DOI:10.1145/3322210"],"references":["325279280_Putting_Making_into_High_School_Computer_Science_Classrooms_Promoting_Equity_in_Teaching_and_Learning_with_Electronic_Textiles_in_Exploring_Computer_Science","315533472_Digital_Youth_Divas_Exploring_Narrative-Driven_Curriculum_to_Spark_Middle_School_Girls'_Interest_in_Computational_Activities","262314073_Toward_Culturally_Responsive_Computing_Education","262273595_Ethnocomputing_with_electronic_textiles_Culturally_responsive_open_design_to_broaden_participation_in_computing_in_American_Indian_youth_and_communities","258198650_Culturally_Responsive_Computing_in_Urban_After-School_Contexts_Two_Approaches","254074787_Toward_a_Theory_of_Culturally_Relevant_Pedagogy","249423501_Culturally_Situated_Design_Tools_Ethnocomputing_from_Field_Site_to_Classroom","247502531_Inquiry_Modeling_and_Metacognition_Making_Science_Accessible_to_All_Students","234801355_Animal_tlatoque_Attracting_middle_school_students_to_computing_through_culturally-relevant_themes","232938449_Conceptualizing_the_Role_and_Influence_of_Student-Teacher_Relationships_on_Children's_Social_and_Cognitive_Development","31640397_Qualitative_methods_in_research_on_teaching","332862463_A_cultural-historical_view_of_human_nature","331738199_The_Discovery_of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_for_Qualitative_Research","331253721_The_Cambridge_Handbook_of_Computing_Education_Research","323743476_Ethics_Identity_and_Political_Vision_Toward_a_Justice-Centered_Approach_to_Equity_in_Computer_Science_Education","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","317953558_The_dreamkeepers_successful_teachers_of_African_American_children","317953471_Qualitative_Research_and_Case_Study_Applications_In_Education","317223547_Seeing_Myself_through_Someone_Else's_Eyes_The_Value_of_In-Classroom_Coaching_for_Computer_Science_Teaching_and_Learning","307981919_Introduction_to_qualitative_research","307981818_Qualitative_research_for_education_An_introduction_to_theories_and_methods","294425313_It_takes_a_village_supporting_inquiry-_and_equity-oriented_computer_science_pedagogy_through_a_professional_learning_community","278708447_Qualitative_Research_Methods_for_Science_Education","276207383_The_Interpretation_of_Cultures_Selected_Essays_by_Clifford_Geertz","271625645_Culturally_responsive_computing_a_theory_revisited","257925990_How_People_Learn_Mind_Brain_Experience_and_School","254004865_Beyond_curriculum_The_exploring_computer_science_program","250184969_Is_October_Brown_Chinese_A_Cultural_Modeling_Activity_System_for_Underachieving_Students","250144791_Rappin'_Reader_and_Say_Say_OH_Playmate_Using_Children's_Childhood_Songs_as_Literacy_Scaffolds_in_Computer-Based_Learning_Environments","248942402_Toward_A_Framework_for_Culturally_Responsive_Design_in_Multimedia_Computer_Environments_Cultural_Modeling_as_a_Case","247841948_The_Dreamkeepers_Successful_teachers_of_African_American_children","242423427_Exploring_Computer_Science_with_Scheme","239065085_Funds_of_knowledge_for_teaching_Using_a_qualitative_approach_to_connect_homes_and_classrooms","229887552_Culturally_responsive_technology_use_Developing_an_on-line_community_of_learners","221537226_Unlocking_The_Clubhouse_Women_in_Computing","220094547_Exploring_Computer_Science_A_Case_Study_of_School_Reform","201381775_Experience_And_Education"]}
