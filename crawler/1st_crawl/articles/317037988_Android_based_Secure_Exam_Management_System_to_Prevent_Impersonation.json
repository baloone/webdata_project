{"id":"317037988_Android_based_Secure_Exam_Management_System_to_Prevent_Impersonation","abstract":"Nowadays the users of android mobile are increasing rapidly, the works done by PCs are being implemented in smart phones. So E-learning is enhanced by M-learning. However, managing the exam and providing the security in open environment where each student has his/her own android device connected to a Wi-Fi network through which it is further connected to the internet can be a most challenging task. In such environments, various vulnerabilities may occur which may violate the exam such as students can exchange information over the network during exam time. Hence this paper aims to identify such vulnerabilities and provide the appropriate security services to ensure exam security.","authors":["Ramesh Nagal","Prakash Nemkul","Dispesh Kumar","Naveen Kumar"],"meta":["May 2017","Project: Mini Projects"],"references":["292991524_Designing_a_Secure_Exam_Management_System_SEMS_for_M-Learning_Environments","313452479_Design_of_Multi-terminal_Mobile_Learning_Platform","301387666_Design_and_Development_of_the_Online_Examination_System_Based_on_BS_Structure","298711061_Design_and_implementation_of_secure_computer_based_examination_system_based_on_BS_structure"]}
