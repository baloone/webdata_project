{"id":"287148222_23-Restricted_Connectivity_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","abstract":"Given a graph G and non-negative integer h, the h-restricted connectivity of G is the minimum cardinality of a set of nodes in G, if exists, whose deletion disconnects G and the degree of each node in every remaining component is at least h. The h-restricted connectivity is a generalization of the classical connectivity and can provide more accurate measures for the reliability or fault-tolerance of multiprocessor system. The n-dimensional locally twisted cubes, denoted by , are a well-known network topology for building multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we first show that 2-restricted connectivity of the n-dimensional locally twisted cubes is for , and show that 3-restricted connectivity is equal to for .","authors":["Sun-Yuan Hsieh","Hong-Wen Huang","Chia-Wei Lee"],"meta":["December 2015Theoretical Computer Science 615","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2015.11.050"],"references":["263094074_On_3-Extra_Connectivity_and_3-Extra_Edge_Connectivity_of_Folded_Hypercubes","241716103_Extra_edge_connectivity_of_hypercube-like_networks","220185761_On_the_extraconnectivity_of_graphs","220185168_Extraconnectivity_of_graphs_with_large_girth","3043255_Conditional_Connectivity_Measures_for_Large_Multiprocessor_Systems","262399905_A_kind_of_conditional_fault_tolerance_of_nk-star_graphs","257145053_Extraconnectivity_of_-ary_-cube_networks","256744864_2323-Extraconnectivities_of_hypercube-like_networks","235246839_A_kind_of_conditional_fault_tolerance_of_alternating_group_graphs","229530874_Conditional_connectivity","229420774_Zinc_ions_surface-doped_titanium_dioxide_nanotubes_and_its_photocatalysis_activity_for_degradation_of_methyl_orange_in_water","223507005_Locally_twisted_cubes_are_4-pancyclic","222857818_Conditional_edge_connectivity_properties_reliability_comparisons_and_transitivity_of_graphs","222537724_The_super_connectivity_of_augmented_cubes","221450026_The_Restricted_Connectivity_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","220661251_The_locally_twisted_cubes","220570780_On_a_kind_of_restricted_edge_connectivity_of_graphs","220563607_k-Restricted_edge_connectivity_for_some_interconnection_networks","220557084_Restricted_connectivity_for_three_families_of_interconnection_networks","220358508_On_conditional_diagnosability_and_reliability_of_the_BC_networks","220246023_The_Conditional_Node_Connectivity_Of_The_k-Ary_n-Cube","220189375_Optimally_super-edge-connected_transitive_graphs","220187290_On_restricted_edge-connectivity_of_graphs","220181048_Fault_Tolerance_on_Star_Graphs","220115200_Conditional_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","220114222_Fault-tolerant_analysis_of_a_class_of_networks","220112735_The_super_connectivity_of_shuffle-cubes","6537653_Developmental_lead_exposure_alters_gene_expression_of_metabotropic_glutamate_receptors_in_rat_hippocampal_neurons","3042531_Generalized_measure_of_fault_tolerance_with_application_to_N-cubes"]}
