{"id":"225593942_On_moving_a_sofa_around_a_corner","abstract":"A necessary condition is given for a region of the plane to have the greatest possible area of any region able to move around\na right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width. A region is constructed, with area 2.2195... and bounded by 18 analytic\npieces, which satisfies this condition. It is conjectured that this is the unique region of maximum area.","authors":["Joseph L.
