The pivot point of the problem which requires the focus is sorting algorithm. Sorting is the rearrangement of items or integers in an ordered way. In this research platform a modified cycle sort algorithm was devised and then comparative study of different sorting algorithms like Selection sort, Merge sort, Cycle sort and Bubble sort is being done. We also used other variety of other sorting algorithms with it. An entirely modified concept which is being sorted out. A program instigated in python has been used for gauging of CPU time taken by each algorithm. Results were obtained after cataloguing and graphically represented. For core precision program was casted a number of times and itâ€™s concluded that modified cycle sort was the best option among all linear sorting algorithms where we have duplicate data and for large inputs efficiency has also ascended.","authors":["Aman Nakib","Nakib Aman Turzo","Pritom Sarker","Biplob Kumar"],"meta":["April 2020","Project: comparison"],"references":["319436458_Parallelization_of_Modified_Merge_Sort_Algorithm","315662067_Sorting_Algorithms_-_A_Comparative_Study","306258293_A_Comparative_Study_of_Different_Types_of_comparison_Based_Sorting_Algorithms_in_Data_Structure","259911982_Review_on_Sorting_Algorithms_A_Comparative_Study","45087894_Robustness_versus_Performance_in_Sorting_and_Tournament_Algorithms","273011281_Proposal_of_a_Two_Way_Sorting_Algorithm_and_Performance_Comparison_with_Existing_Algorithms","221321517_A_comparative_study_of_parallel_sort_algorithms","30867274_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Computer_Algorithms"]}
