{"id":"339293945_Numerical_simulation_and_experimental_investigations_on_a_three-roller_setting_round_process_for_thin-walled_pipes","abstract":"In order to reveal the process principle of three-roller setting round process and optimize the setting round strategy, the three-roller setting round process is simulated and experimented. The results show that there are three positive bending regions and three reverse bending regions in the cross section of pipe in the setting round process. The absolute value of equivalent stress and equivalent strain not only decreases from both ends to the geometric neutral layer along the thickness direction of pipe but also decreases from the center of each positive and negative bending region to both sides along the circumferential direction of pipe. The distribution of maximum stress and minimum stress conforms to the characteristics of pure bending deformation in the setting round process. The direction of tangential stress is the direction of main stress, and the direction of tangential strain is the direction of main strain. The geometrical dimensions of pipe do not change in axial and radial directions. The residual ovality of pipes with different initial ovality is basically the same, which proves that the uniform curvature theorem of reciprocating bending is correct. The residual ovality of pipes decreases with the increase of the reduction. With the increase of the relative thickness of pipes, the optimum reduction of pipes decreases gradually. Comparing experimental results with simulation results, the residual ovality of pipes can be less than 0.2%.","authors":["Xueying Huang","Yu Gaochao","Jun Zhao","Zhenkai Mu"],"meta":["March 2020The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology 107(9)","DOI:10.1007/s00170-020-05087-2","Project: Study on the process and theory of roller-type continuous and synchronous adjusting straightness and roundness on thin-walled pipe based on the reciprocating bending"],"references":["319459922_Research_on_the_Symmetrical_Three-roller_Setting_Round_Process","305460638_Elastic-plastic_secondary_indeterminate_problem_for_thin-walled_pipe_through_the_inner-wall_loading_by_three-point_bending","324125805_A_comparison_of_mechanical_properties_and_residual_stresses_of_line_pipes_sized_by_expansion_and_compression_process","309258049_Uniform_curvature_theorem_by_reciprocating_bending_and_its_experimental_verification","289709991_Study_on_control_policy_of_over-bending_setting_round_for_pipe_ends_of_large_pipes","289584189_A_mechanical_model_of_symmetrical_three-roller_setting_round_process_The_static_bending_stage","288849543_Numerical_simulation_of_rounding-sizing_process_of_large-sized_straight_welded_pipe","288648314_Quantitative_prediction_of_reduction_in_large_pipe_setting_round_process","280647696_Experimental_analysis_of_an_asymmetrical_three-roll_bending_process","278722212_Precise_compression_and_setting_round_by_mold_for_large_pipes","272663098_Equivalence_Relation_of_Curved_Beam_Pure_Bending_and_Its_Experimental_Verification","271180658_Springback_Analysis_of_Expanding_and_Setting_Round_for_Large_Diameter_Pipe","269355430_Effects_of_Geometry_Parameters_on_Mechanical_Expanding_of_Large_Diameter_Welding_Pipe","269354617_Deformation_Characteristic_Analysis_on_Mechanical_Expanding_of_Large_Diameter_Welding_Pipe","260212826_Prediction_and_control_of_springback_in_setting_round_process_for_pipe-end_of_large_pipe"]}
