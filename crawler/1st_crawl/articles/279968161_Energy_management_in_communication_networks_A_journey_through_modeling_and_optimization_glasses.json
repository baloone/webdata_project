{"id":"279968161_Energy_management_in_communication_networks_A_journey_through_modeling_and_optimization_glasses","abstract":"The widespread proliferation of Internet and wireless applications has\nproduced a significant increase of ICT energy footprint. As a response, in the\nlast five years, significant efforts have been undertaken to include\nenergy-awareness into network management. Several green networking frameworks\nhave been proposed by carefully managing the network routing and the power\nstate of network devices.\nEven though approaches proposed differ based on network technologies and\nsleep modes of nodes and interfaces, they all aim at tailoring the active\nnetwork resources to the varying traffic needs in order to minimize energy\nconsumption. From a modeling point of view, this has several commonalities with\nclassical network design and routing problems, even if with different\nobjectives and in a dynamic context.\nWith most researchers focused on addressing the complex and crucial\ntechnological aspects of green networking schemes, there has been so far little\nattention on understanding the modeling similarities and differences of\nproposed solutions. This paper fills the gap surveying the literature with\noptimization modeling glasses, following a tutorial approach that guides\nthrough the different components of the models with a unified symbolism. A\ndetailed classification of the previous work based on the modeling issues\nincluded is also proposed.","authors":["Bernardetta Addis","Antonio Capone","Giuliana Carello","Luca G.
