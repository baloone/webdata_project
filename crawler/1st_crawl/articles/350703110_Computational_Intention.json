{"id":"350703110_Computational_Intention","abstract":"The core entities of computer science include formal languages, spec-ifications, models, programs, implementations, semantic theories, type inference systems, abstract and physical machines. While there are conceptual questions concerning their nature, and in particular ontological ones (Turner 2018), our main focus here will be on the relationships between them. These relationships have an extensional aspect that articulates the propositional connection between the two entities, and an intentional one that fixes the direction of governance. An analysis of these two aspects will drive our investigation; an investigation that will touch upon some of the central concerns of the philosophy of computer science (Turner 2017).","authors":["Raymond Turner"],"meta":["September 2020Studies in Logic 63(1):19-30","DOI:10.2478/slgr-2020-0025"],"references":["312626867_The_Philosophy_of_Computer_Science","334217945_Correctness_Explanation_and_Intention","326327276_Computational_Artifacts_Towards_a_Philosophy_of_Computer_Science","326322949_Computability_Towards_a_Philosophy_of_Computer_Science","318494164_The_Calculi_of_Lambda_Conversion","313550915_An_Axiomatic_Basis_of_Computer_Programming","303616836_When_does_a_physical_system_compute","301340622_Physical_Computation_A_Mechanistic_Account","292057563_Technological_explanations_The_relation_between_structure_and_function_of_technological_objects","291862103_Paradox_and_Platitude_in_Wittgenstein's_Philosophy","266017685_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Theories","277257451_Computation_in_Physical_Systems","270381058_Illocutionary_Acts_Sentence_Meaning","268831480_Lambda_Calculus_Some_Models_Some_Philosophy","257623104_Specification"]}
