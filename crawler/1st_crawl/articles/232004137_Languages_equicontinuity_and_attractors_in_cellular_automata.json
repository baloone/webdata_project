{"id":"232004137_Languages_equicontinuity_and_attractors_in_cellular_automata","abstract":"We consider three related classifications of cellular\nautomata: the first is based on the complexity of languages\ngenerated by clopen partitions of the state space, i.e. on the\ncomplexity of the factor subshifts; the second is based on\nthe concept of equicontinuity and it is a modification of the\nclassification introduced by Gilman [9]. The third one\nis based on the concept of attractors and it refines the\nclassification introduced by Hurley [16]. We show\nrelations between these classifications and give examples of\ncellular automata in the intersection classes. In particular, we\nshow that every positively expansive cellular automaton is\nconjugate to a one-sided subshift of finite type and that every\ntopologically transitive cellular automaton is sensitive to\ninitial conditions. We also construct a cellular automaton with\nminimal quasi-attractor, whose basin has measure zero, answering\na question raised in Hurley [16].","authors":["PETR  KURKA "],"meta":["April 1997Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems 17(02):417 - 433","DOI:10.1017/S014338579706985X"],"references":["243060889_Topological_Entropy_of_Block_Maps","239046913_Symbolic_Dynamics_and_Transformations_of_the_Unit_Interval","222758270_Regular_unimodal_systems_and_factors_of_finite_automata","222335648_Computation_theoretic_aspects_of_cellular_automata","222277456_Dynamical_Behaviour_of_Coven's_Aperiodic_Cellular_Automata","220544485_Endomorphisms_and_Automorphisms_of_the_Shift_Dynamical_Systems","220151044_Boolean_Neural_Nets_are_Observable"]}
