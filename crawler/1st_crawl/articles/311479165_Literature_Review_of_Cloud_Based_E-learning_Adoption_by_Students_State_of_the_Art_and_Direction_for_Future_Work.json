{"id":"311479165_Literature_Review_of_Cloud_Based_E-learning_Adoption_by_Students_State_of_the_Art_and_Direction_for_Future_Work","abstract":"Cloud computing is a new paradigm shift in information technology. Most of the studies in the cloud are business related while the studies in cloud based e-learning are few. The field is still in its infancy and researchers have used several adoption theories to discover the dimensions of this field. The purpose of this paper is to review and integrate the literature to understand the current situation of the cloud based e-learning adoption. A total of 312 articles were extracted from Science direct, emerald, and IEEE. Screening processes were applied to select only the articles that are related to the cloud based e-learning. A total of 231 removed because they are related to business organization. Next, a total of 63 articles were removed because they are technical articles. A total of 18 articles were included in this paper. A frequency analysis was conducted on the paper to identify the most frequent factors, theories, statistical software, respondents, and countries of the studies. The findings showed that usefulness and ease of use are the most frequent factors. TAM is the most prevalent adoption theories in the literature. The mean of the respondents in the reviewed studies is 377 and Malaysia is the most researched countries in terms of cloud based e-learning. Studies of cloud based e-learning are few and more empirical studies are needed.","authors":["Mohammad Hassan Kayali","Nurhizam Safie Mohd Satar","Muriati Mukhtar"],"meta":["November 2016IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 160(1):012087","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/160/1/012087","Project: e-learning"],"references":["286294532_E-learning_initiative_capacity_building_for_healthcare_workforce_of_developing_countries","283563539_Understanding_behavioral_intention_to_use_a_cloud_computing_classroom_A_multiple_model-comparison_approach","309405815_A_cross-cultural_examination_of_the_impact_of_social_organisational_and_individual_factors_on_educational_technology_acceptance_between_British_and_Lebanese_university_students","305847835_Behavioural_intention_in_cloud-based_VLE_An_extension_to_Channel_Expansion_Theory","303557317_Task-Technology_Fit_Assessment_of_Cloud-Based_Collaborative_Learning_Technologies","294290129_Predicting_the_acceptance_of_cloud-based_Virtual_Learning_EnvironmentThe_roles_of_Self_Determination_and_Channel_Expansion_Theory","289585327_Understanding_and_predicting_students'_intention_to_use_mobile_cloud_storage_services","287323426_A_Study_on_User_Adoption_of_Cloud_Storage_Service_in_China_A_Revised_Unified_theory_of_Acceptance_and_Use_of_Technology_Model","284232345_From_concept_to_implementation_The_development_of_the_emerging_cloud_computing_industry_in_China","283131165_Towards_a_quality_model_of_technical_aspects_for_mobile_learning_services_An_empirical_investigation"]}
