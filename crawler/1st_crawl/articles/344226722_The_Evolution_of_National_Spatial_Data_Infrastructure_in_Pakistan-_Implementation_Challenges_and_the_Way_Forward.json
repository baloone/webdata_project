{"id":"344226722_The_Evolution_of_National_Spatial_Data_Infrastructure_in_Pakistan-_Implementation_Challenges_and_the_Way_Forward","abstract":"Geospatial data are produced by several organizations located at various places, and that is clearly a distributed environment. Many technical and institutional issues need to be resolved to share data in such an environment and to eventually enable regional development. For this matter, many countries implement Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) for the last 40 years. Since 2010, also Pakistan is striving to implement an SDI at the national level (NSDI). However, so far, the promised benefits have not yet been achieved. This study explores the evolution of the NSDI in Pakistan from 2010 till 2020 to reveal what kind of challenges the country is facing. Given the importance of stakeholders' support for the implementation of SDIs, we conducted a stakeholder analysis and a dedicated survey. We adopted the power-interest grid method to classify stakeholders' interests based on their authority to influence the NSDI development. Among other, the results show that stakeholdersâ€™ low participation due to insufficient technological, financial, and human resources impedes NSDI implementation efforts in the country.","authors":["Asmat Ali","Muhammad Imran"],"meta":["June 2021International Journal of Spatial Data Infrastructures Research 15:33","DOI:10.2902/1725-0463.15.art5","Projects: Agriculture policymakingMapping National SDIsdoctoral dissertationPakistan's National Spatial Data Infrastructure (Pak-NSDI)"],"references":["342692115_Spatially_analyzing_food_consumption_inequalities_using_GIS_with_disaggregated_data_from_Punjab_Pakistan_Analyzing_food_patterns_in_Punjab_using_disaggregated_data_with_GIS","339180550_Cloud_enabled_SDI_architecture_a_review","338723656_Conciliating_Perspectives_from_Mapping_Agencies_and_Web_of_Data_on_Successful_European_SDIs_Toward_a_European_Geographic_Knowledge_Graph","336210718_Geographic_Information_Systems_to_Spatial_Data_Infrastructure_A_Global_Perspective","335083582_Toward_the_Evolution_of_National_Spatial_Data_Infrastructure_Development_in_Indonesia","334485372_Expanding_the_ICA_model_of_stakeholders_in_a_spatial_data_infrastructure_SDI","331280480_Criteria_to_consider_in_selecting_and_prioritizing_infrastructure_projects","328530837_Future_Development_of_NSDI_Based_on_the_European_INSPIRE_Directive_-_Case_Study_of_a_Bosnian_and_Herzegovinian_Geoportal","326734824_A_multi-level_perspective_on_a_spatial_data_ecosystem_needs_and_challenges_among_urban_planning_stakeholders_in_New_Zealand","337919059_A_Conceptual_Framework_of_Public_Health_SDI","326295357_A_comparative_analysis_of_stakeholder_roles_in_the_spatial_data_infrastructures_of_South_Africa_Namibia_and_Ghana","323334492_GeoFog4Health_a_fog-based_SDI_framework_for_geospatial_health_big_data_analysis","319367788_SWOT_ANALYSIS_A_THEORETICAL_REVIEW","317572574_Sustainable_development_and_geospatial_information_a_strategic_framework_for_integrating_a_global_policy_agenda_into_national_geospatial_capabilities","326432347_The_Rainbow_Metaphor_Spatial_Data_Infrastructure_Organization_and_Implementation_in_India"]}
