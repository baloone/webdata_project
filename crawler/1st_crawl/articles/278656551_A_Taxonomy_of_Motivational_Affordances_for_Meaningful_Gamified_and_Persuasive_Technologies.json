{"id":"278656551_A_Taxonomy_of_Motivational_Affordances_for_Meaningful_Gamified_and_Persuasive_Technologies","abstract":"Sustainable human-computer interaction is investigating the role of persuasive and gamified technologies in encouraging people to engage in a more sustainable lifestyle. Motivation is a key requirement for behavior change, yet many persuasive systems do not sufficiently account for motivational aspects. In this paper we investigate under which circumstances components such as feedback and game elements (e.g., rewards) afford user motivation. The result is a taxonomy of design components that is grounded in well-established psychological theories on motivation. We illustrate how the taxonomy can contribute to the design of meaningful persuasive technologies by discussing a case study from the domain of sustainable mobility behavior (the project GoEco!).","authors":["Paul Weiser","Dominik Bucher","Francesca Cellina","Vanessa De Luca"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.2991/ict4s-env-15.2015.31","Conference: ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S)At: Copenhagen","Project: GoEco! - Fostering Sustainable Mobility"],"references":["303084050_Situated_motivational_affordances_of_game_elements_A_conceptual_model","287199674_Towards_Sustainable_Mobility_Behavior_Research_Challenges_for_Location-Aware_Information_and_Communication_Technology","280012034_Behavior_Change_or_Empowerment_On_the_Ethics_of_Health-Promotion_Strategies","278405715_Beyond_Self-Tracking_and_Reminders_Designing_Smartphone_Apps_That_Support_Habit_Formation","277679202_Human-Agent_Collectives","301429247_Improving_player_balancing_in_racing_games","300587657_Co-design_of_Neighbourhood_Services_Using_Gamification_Cards","297940587_Followership_-_It's_personal_too","285827880_Thinking_Fast_and_Slow","274872012_Beyond_sharing_Cultivating_cooperative_transportation_systems_through_geographic_information_science"]}
