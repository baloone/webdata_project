{"id":"301695145_The_Interrelationships_between_Quality_Management_Practices_and_Their_Effects_on_Innovation_Performance","abstract":"Quality improvement initiatives have positive results in cost reduction, increased productivity and provide competitive advantages in the marketplace. However, the question is whether the concept of quality and innovation are complementary or competing strategies. Are there specific approaches in the implementation of quality systems that provide satisfactory results on both sites? Performances of analyzed companies suggest that quality is necessary but insufficient in business today. The primary purpose of this study is to explore the relationship and mutual influence between quality management practices and innovation performances. The findings suggest that there are areas with positive relationships between these two strategies that managers can focus to improve innovation performance.","authors":["Benjamin Durakovic","Hazim Bašić","Haris Muhic"],"meta":["September 2014","Project: TEMPUS IV – 6th Call for proposals Structural Measures Bosnia and Herzegovina Qualification Framework for Higher Education (BHQFHE)"],"references":["332752421_TEXTILE_CUTTING_PROCESS_OPTIMIZATION_MODEL_BASED_ON_SIX_SIGMA_METHODOLOGY_IN_A_MEDIUM-SIZED_COMPANY","332752096_RESEARCH_OF_INNOVATION_POTENTIAL_IN_BH_IN_THE_FUNCTION_OF_THE_ABSORPTION_CAPACITY_OF_INNOVATIONS","301695132_SIX_SIGMA_MODEL_TESTING_IN_OPTIMIZING_MEDIUM-SIZED_COMPANY_PRODUCTION_PROCESS","235274612_The_impact_of_total_quality_management_on_innovation_Findings_from_a_developing_country","272002937_TQM_and_Innovation_A_Literature_Review_and_Research_Framework","257105271_Relationship_between_quality_management_practices_and_innovation","245131927_Are_quality_and_innovation_management_conflicting_activities","245131748_Innovativeness_and_organizational_innovation_in_total_quality_oriented_firms_The_moderating_role_of_market_turbulence","245131380_Total_quality_management_as_a_forerunner_of_business_innovation_capability","235313860_Relationship_between_TQM_and_innovation_An_empirical_study"]}
