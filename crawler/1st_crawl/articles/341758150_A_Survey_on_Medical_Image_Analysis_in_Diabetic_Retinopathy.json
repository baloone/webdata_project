{"id":"341758150_A_Survey_on_Medical_Image_Analysis_in_Diabetic_Retinopathy","abstract":"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) represents a highly-prevalent complication of diabetes in which individuals suffer from damage to the blood vessels in the retina. The disease manifests itself through lesion presence, starting with microaneurysms, at the nonproliferative stage before being characterized by neovascularization in the proliferative stage. Retinal specialists strive to detect DR early so that the disease can be treated before substantial, irreversible vision loss occurs. The level of DR severity indicates the extent of treatment necessary - vision loss may be preventable by effective diabetes management in mild (early) stages, rather than subjecting the patient to invasive laser surgery. Using artificial intelligence (AI), highly accurate and efficient systems can be developed to help assist medical professionals in screening and diagnosing DR earlier and without the full resources that are available in specialty clinics. In particular, deep learning facilitates diagnosis earlier and with higher sensitivity and specificity. Such systems make decisions based on minimally handcrafted features and pave the way for personalized therapies. Thus, this survey provides a comprehensive description of the current technology used in each step of DR diagnosis. First, it begins with an introduction to the disease and the current technologies and resources available in this space. It proceeds to discuss the frameworks that different teams have used to detect and classify DR. Ultimately, we conclude that deep learning systems offer revolutionary potential to DR identification and prevention of vision loss.","authors":["Skylar Stolte","Ruogu Fang"],"meta":["May 2020Medical
