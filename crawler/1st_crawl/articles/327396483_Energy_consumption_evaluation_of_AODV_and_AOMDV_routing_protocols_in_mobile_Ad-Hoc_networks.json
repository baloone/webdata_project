{"id":"327396483_Energy_consumption_evaluation_of_AODV_and_AOMDV_routing_protocols_in_mobile_Ad-Hoc_networks","abstract":"Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are mobile, multi-hop wireless networks that can be set up anytime, anywhere without the need of pre-existing infrastructure. Due to its dynamic topology the main challenge in such networks is to design dynamic routing protocols, which are efficient in terms of consumption of energy and producing less overhead. The main emphasis of this research is upon the prominent issues of MANETs such as energy efficiency and scalability along with some traditional performance metrics for performance evaluation. Two proactive routing protocols used in this research are single-path AODV versus multi-path AOMDV. Extensive simulation has been done in NS2 simulator, which includes ten scenarios. The simulation results revealed that the performance of AOMDV is more optimal as compared to AODV in terms of throughput, packet delivery fraction and end to end delay. However, in terms of consumption of energy and NRL the AODV protocol performed better as compared to AOMDV.
