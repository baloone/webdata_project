{"id":"320859739_Microsoft_Academic_A_multidisciplinary_comparison_of_citation_counts_with_Scopus_and_Mendeley_for_29_journals","abstract":"Microsoft Academic is a free citation index that allows large scale data collection. This combination makes it useful for scientometric research. Previous studies have found that its citation counts tend to be slightly larger than those of Scopus but smaller than Google Scholar, with disciplinary variations. This study reports the largest and most systematic analysis so far, of 172,752 articles in 29 large journals chosen from different specialisms. From Scopus citation counts, Microsoft Academic citation counts and Mendeley reader counts for articles published 2007-2017, Microsoft Academic found a slightly more (6%) citations than Scopus overall and especially for the current year (51%). It found fewer citations than Mendeley readers overall (59%), and only 7% as many for the current year. Differences between journals were probably due to field preprint sharing cultures or journal policies rather than broad disciplinary differences.","authors":["Mike Thelwall"],"meta":["November 2017Journal of Informetrics 11(4):1201-1212","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2017.10.006"],"references":["318162758_Microsoft_Academic_is_one_year_old_the_Phoenix_is_ready_to_leave_the_nest","315105670_The_coverage_of_Microsoft_Academic_Analyzing_the_publication_output_of_a_university","310739030_Microsoft_Academic_is_the_phoenix_getting_wings","308320932_Citation_Analysis_with_Microsoft_Academic","303856491_Microsoft_Academic_Search_a_Phoenix_arisen_from_the_ashes","289292128_How_well_developed_are_altmetrics_cross-disciplinary_analysis_of_the_presence_of_'alternative_metrics'_in_scientific_publications_RIP","284812572_Google_Scholar_Scopus_and_the_Web_of_Science_A_longitudinal_and_cross-disciplinary_comparison","283722260_The_Journal_Coverage_of_Web_of_Science_and_Scopus_a_Comparative_Analysis","273515057_Errors_in_DOI_indexing_by_bibliometric_databases","268271559_Users_Narcissism_and_Control-Tracking_the_Impact_of_Scholarly_Publications_in_the_21_st_Century","266396518_Tweets_vs_Mendeley_readers_How_do_these_two_social_media_metrics_differ","261365934_How_well_developed_are_Altmetrics_Cross-disciplinary_analysis_of_the_presence_of_'alternative_metrics'_in_scientific_publications","257662692_A_longitudinal_study_of_Google_Scholar_coverage_between_2012_and_2013","51202960_Towards_a_new_crown_indicator_An_empirical_analysis","5958226_Comparison_of_PubMed_Scopus_Web_of_Science_and_Google_Scholar_Strengths_and_weaknesses","320675293_Does_Microsoft_Academic_find_early_citations","320065037_Academic_knowledge_tourism","319368837_How_quickly_do_publications_get_read_The_evolution_of_mendeley_reader_counts_for_new_articles","318080973_Suitability_of_Google_Scholar_as_a_source_of_scientific_information_and_as_a_source_of_data_for_scientific_evaluation-Review_of_the_Literature","316702468_Are_Mendeley_reader_counts_high_enough_for_research_evaluations_when_articles_are_published","311430531_Three_practical_field_normalised_alternative_indicator_formulae_for_research_evaluation","307822863_An_Overview_of_Microsoft_Academic_Service_MAS_and_Applications","289572013_Availability_of_digital_object_identifiers_DOIs_in_Web_of_Science_and_Scopus","272891568_Geometric_journal_impact_factors_correcting_for_individual_highly_cited_articles","270598579_When_are_readership_counts_as_useful_as_citation_counts_Scopus_versus_Mendeley_for_LIS_journals","268519250_Can_Mendeley_Bookmarks_Reflect_Readership_A_Survey_of_User_Motivations","264781866_Are_Scholarly_Articles_Disproportionately_Read_in_Their_Own_Country_An_Analysis_of_Mendeley_Readers","261855483_Evaluating_altmetric","260282747_Altmetrics_A_Manifesto","257663130_The_Journal_Impact_Factor_Angel_devil_or_scapegoat_A_comment_on_JK_Vanclay's_article_2011","257662878_Citation_time_window_choice_for_research_impact_evaluation","252065499_Citation_Flows_in_the_Zones_of_Influence_of_Scientific_Collaborations","242434755_Digital_Object_Identifier_DOI_System","220365199_Empirical_study_of_journal_impact_factors_obtained_using_the_classical_two-year_citation_window_versus_a_five-year_citation_window"]}
