In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model based on deep learning methods that integrates Graph Convolutional networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks (GC-LSTM) to model and forecast the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 concentrations. Specifically, historical observations on different stations are constructed as spatiotemporal graph series, and historical air quality variables, meteorological factors, spatial terms and temporal attributes are defined as graph signals. To evaluate the performance of the GC-LSTM, we compared our results with several state-of-the-art methods in different time intervals. Based on the results, our GC-LSTM model achieved the best performance for predictions. Moreover, evaluations of recall rate (68.45%), false alarm rate (4.65%) (both of threshold: 115 μg/m³) and correlation coefficient R² (0.72) for 72-hour predictions also verify the feasibility of our proposed model. This methodology can be used for concentration forecasting of different air pollutants in future.","authors":["Yanlin Qi","Qi Li","Hamed Karimian","Di Liu"],"meta":["February 2019Science of The Total Environment 664","DOI:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.333"],"references":["326312442_A_Deep_CNN-LSTM_Model_for_Particulate_Matter_PM25_Forecasting_in_Smart_Cities","325848961_Spatio-temporal_variation_of_wind_influence_on_distribution_of_fine_particulate_matter_and_its_precursor_gases","321867154_Satellite-based_Mapping_of_Daily_High-Resolution_Ground_PM_25_in_China_via_Space-Time_Regression_Modeling","320525631_A_Spatiotemporal_Prediction_Framework_for_Air_Pollution_Based_on_Deep_RNN","320071811_TEHRAN_AIR_POLLUTANTS_PREDICTION_BASED_ON_RANDOM_FOREST_FEATURE_SELECTION_METHOD","319714176_Long_short-term_memory_neural_network_for_air_pollutant_concentration_predictions_Method_development_and_evaluation","319223285_Deriving_Hourly_PM25_Concentrations_from_Himawari-8_AODs_over_Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei_in_China","316466503_Validation_of_VIIRS_AOD_through_a_comparison_with_a_sun_photometer_and_MODIS_AODs_over_Wuhan","326313147_Estimation_of_ultrahigh_resolution_PM_25_concentrations_in_urban_areas_using_160_m_Gaofen-1_AOD_retrievals","325780043_Estimating_hourly_PM_1_concentrations_from_Himawari-8_aerosol_optical_depth_in_China"]}
