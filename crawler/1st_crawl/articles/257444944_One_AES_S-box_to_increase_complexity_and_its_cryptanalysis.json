{"id":"257444944_One_AES_S-box_to_increase_complexity_and_its_cryptanalysis","abstract":"It is well known that the algebraic expression of AES S-box is very simple and only 9 terms are involved. Hence, AES security is suspected although there is no vulnerability on it so far. To eliminate the weakness of extremely small terms in the algebraic expression of AES S-box, one improved AES S-box is proposed, which preserves the algebraic degree invariable but significantly increases the number of its algebraic expression terms from 9 to 255.At the same time, Boolean function has good characters in balance and strict avalanche criterion (SAC), etc. Finally, it is proved that the improved AES S-box scheme is secure against the powerful known difierential and linear cryptanalysis.","authors":["Jingmei Liu","Wei Baodian","Wang Xinmei"],"meta":["June 2007Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics 18(2):427â€“433","DOI:10.1016/S1004-4132(07)60108-X"],"references":["220336014_Cryptanalysis_of_Block_Ciphers_with_Overdefined_Systems_of_Equations","2357166_Smart_Hill_Climbing_Finds_Better_Boolean_Functions","2237728_AES_proposal_rijndael","225584745_Linear_cryptanalysis_method_for_DES_cipher_III","13771413_Communication_theory_of_secrecy_systems_1945"]}
