{"id":"345240120_Variations_in_sustainable_development_goal_interactions_Population_regional_and_income_disaggregation","abstract":"To fulfill the 2030 Agenda, the complexity of sustainable development goal (SDG) interactions needs to be disentangled. However, this understanding is currently limited. We conduct a cross‐sectional correlational analysis for 2016 to understand SDG interactions under the entire development spectrum. We apply several correlation methods to classify the interaction as synergy or trade‐off and characterize them according to their monotony and linearity. Simultaneously, we analyze SDG interactions considering population, location, income, and regional groups. Our findings highlight that synergies always outweigh trade‐offs and linear outweigh non‐linear interactions. SDG 1, 5, and 6 are associated with linear synergies, SDG 3, and 7 with non‐linear synergies. SDG interactions vary according to a country's income and region along with the gender, age, and location of its population. In summary, to achieve the 2030 Agenda the detected interactions and inequalities across countries need be tracked and leveraged to “leave no one behind.”","authors":["Anne Warchold","Prajal Pradhan","Jürgen P.
