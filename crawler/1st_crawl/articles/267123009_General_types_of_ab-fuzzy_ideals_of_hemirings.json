{"id":"267123009_General_types_of_ab-fuzzy_ideals_of_hemirings","abstract":"W. A. Dudek, M. Shabir and M. Irfan Ali discussed the properties of (α,β)-fuzzy ideals of hemirings [in Comput. Math. Appl. 58, No. 2, 310-321 (2009; Zbl 1189.16041)]. In this paper, we discuss the generalization of their results to (α,β)-fuzzy ideals of hemirings. As a generalization of the notions of (α,∈∨q)-fuzzy left (right) ideals, (α,∈∨q)-fuzzy h-ideals and (α,∈∨q)-fuzzy k-ideals, the concepts of (α,∈∨q m )-fuzzy left (right) ideals, (α,∈∨q m )-fuzzy h-ideals and (α,∈∨q m )-fuzzy k-ideals are defined and their characterizations are considered. Using a left (right) ideal (resp. h-ideal, k-ideal), we construct an (α,∈∨q m )-fuzzy left (right) ideal (resp. (α,∈∨q m )-fuzzy h-ideal, (α,∈∨q m )-fuzzy k-ideal). The implication-based fuzzy h-ideals (k-ideals) of a hemiring are considered.","authors":["Young Bae Jun","Wieslaw Dudek","Muhammad Shabir","Min-Su Kang"],"meta":["September 2010Honam Mathematical Journal 32(3)","DOI:10.5831/HMJ.2010.32.3.413"],"references":["266308135_q-level_subset","266273381_Semirings_Algebraic_theory_and_applications_in_computer_science_Transl_from_the_German","266008387_A_guide_to_the_literature_on_semirings_and_their_applications_in_mathematics_and_information_sciences_With_complete_bibliography","265714286_Semirings_characterized_by_their_fuzzy_ideals","264032517_On_a_b-fuzzy_subalgebras_of_BCKBCI-algebras","262322947_V_q-fuzzy_normal_quasinormal_and_maximal_subgroups","257312830_abab-fuzzy_ideals_of_hemirings","257312585_Note_on_-fuzzy_ideals_of_hemirings","242799905_e_e_v_q-fuzzy_subgroup","240234198_Semirings_and_their_Applications"]}
