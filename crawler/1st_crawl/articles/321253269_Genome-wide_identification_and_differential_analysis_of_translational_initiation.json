{"id":"321253269_Genome-wide_identification_and_differential_analysis_of_translational_initiation","abstract":"Translation is principally regulated at the initiation stage. The development of the translation initiation (TI) sequencing (TI-seq) technique has enabled the global mapping of TIs and revealed unanticipated complex translational landscapes in metazoans. Despite the wide adoption of TI-seq, there is no computational tool currently available for analyzing TI-seq data. To fill this gap, we develop a comprehensive toolkit named Ribo-TISH, which allows for detecting and quantitatively comparing TIs across conditions from TI-seq data. Ribo-TISH can also predict novel open reading frames (ORFs) from regular ribosome profiling (rRibo-seq) data and outperform several established methods in both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. Applied to published TI-seq/rRibo-seq data sets, Ribo-TISH uncovers a novel signature of elevated mitochondrial translation during amino-acid deprivation and predicts novel ORFs in 5â€²UTRs, long noncoding RNAs, and introns. These successful applications demonstrate the power of Ribo-TISH in extracting biological insights from TI-seq/rRibo-seq data.","authors":["Peng Zhang","Dandan He","Yi Xu","Jiakai Hou"],"meta":["November 2017Nature Communications 8(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-017-01981-8"],"references":["311510728_Insights_into_the_mechanisms_of_eukaryotic_translation_gained_with_ribosome_profiling","309700025_Comparative_survey_of_the_relative_impact_of_mRNA_features_on_local_ribosome_profiling_read_density","308183147_RiboDiff_Detecting_Changes_of_mRNA_Translation_Efficiency_from_Ribosome_Footprints","305419117_Pervasive_isoform-specific_translational_regulation_via_alternative_transcription_start_sites_in_mammals","325582322_Tunable_protein_synthesis_by_transcript_isoforms_in_human_cells","313642734_RiboTools_a_Galaxy_toolbox_for_qualitative_ribosome_profiling_analysis","311534771_A_scaling_normalization_method_for_differential_expression_analysis_of_RNA-seq_data","303693440_RSEM_accurate_transcript_quantification_from_RNA-Seq_data_with_or_without_a_reference_genome_BMC_Bioinform_12323","303619599_Extensive_translation_of_small_Open_Reading_Frames_revealed_by_Poly-Ribo-Seq","302941329_Many_lincRNAs_are_translated_and_some_are_likely_to_express_functional_proteins"]}
