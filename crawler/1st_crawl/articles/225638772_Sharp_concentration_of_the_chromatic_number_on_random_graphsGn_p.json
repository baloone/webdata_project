For fixedp it concentrates almost surely in √n ω(n) consecutive integers where ω(n) approaches infinity arbitrarily slowly. If the average degreepn is less thann\n1/6, it concentrates almost surely in five consecutive integers. Large deviation estimates for martingales are used in the proof.","authors":["Eli Shamir","Joel Spencer"],"meta":["March 1987Combinatorica 7(1):121-129","DOI:10.1007/BF02579208","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["270367034_A_First_Course_in_Stochastic_Processes","266182634_On_the_chromatic_number_of_sparse_random_graphs","258873733_On_coloring_random_graphs","242356795_A_First_Course_in_Stochastic_Process","231964851_Cliques_in_random_graphs","223124398_Sequential_and_Distributed_Graph_Coloring_Algorithms_with_Performance_Analysis_in_Random_Graph_Spaces"]}
