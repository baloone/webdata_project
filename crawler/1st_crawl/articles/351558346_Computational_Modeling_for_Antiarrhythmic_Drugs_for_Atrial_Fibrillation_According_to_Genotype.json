{"id":"351558346_Computational_Modeling_for_Antiarrhythmic_Drugs_for_Atrial_Fibrillation_According_to_Genotype","abstract":"Background: The efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) can vary in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and the PITX2 gene affects the responsiveness of AADs. We explored the virtual AAD (V-AAD) responses between wild-type and PITX2 +/− -deficient AF conditions by realistic in silico AF modeling.\nMethods: We tested the V-AADs in AF modeling integrated with patients' 3D-computed tomography and 3D-electroanatomical mapping, acquired in 25 patients (68% male, 59.8 ± 9.8 years old, 32.0% paroxysmal type). The ion currents for the PITX2 +/− deficiency and each AAD (amiodarone, sotalol, dronedarone, flecainide, and propafenone) were defined based on previous publications.\nResults: We compared the wild-type and PITX2 +/− deficiency in terms of the action potential duration (APD 90 ), conduction velocity (CV), maximal slope of restitution (Smax), and wave-dynamic parameters, such as the dominant frequency (DF), phase singularities (PS), and AF termination rates according to the V-AADs. The PITX2 +/− -deficient model exhibited a shorter APD 90 ( p < 0.001), a lower Smax ( p < 0.001), mean DF ( p = 0.012), PS number ( p < 0.001), and a longer AF cycle length (AFCL, p = 0.011). Five V-AADs changed the electrophysiology in a dose-dependent manner. AAD-induced AFCL lengthening ( p < 0.001) and reductions in the CV ( p = 0.033), peak DF ( p < 0.001), and PS number ( p < 0.001) were more significant in PITX2 +/− -deficient than wild-type AF. PITX2 +/− -deficient AF was easier to terminate with class IC AADs than the wild-type AF ( p = 0.018).\nConclusions: The computational modeling-guided AAD test was feasible for evaluating the efficacy of multiple AADs in patients with AF. AF wave-dynamic and electrophysiological characteristics are different among the PITX2 -deficient and the wild-type genotype models.","authors":["Inseok Hwang","Je-Wook Park","Oh-Seok Kwon","Byounghyun Lim"],"meta":["May 2021Frontiers in Physiology 12","DOI:10.3389/fphys.2021.650449"],"references":["348839309_In_Silico_Assessment_of_Class_I_Antiarrhythmic_Drug_Effects_on_Pitx2-Induced_Atrial_Fibrillation_Insights_from_Populations_of_Electrophysiological_Models_of_Human_Atrial_Cells_and_Tissues","339208779_In_situ_procedure_for_high-efficiency_computational_modeling_of_atrial_fibrillation_reflecting_personal_anatomy_fiber_orientation_fibrosis_and_electrophysiology","337975842_Clinical_Usefulness_of_Computational_Modeling-Guided_Persistent_Atrial_Fibrillation_Ablation_Updated_Outcome_of_Multicenter_Randomized_Study","335248143_Computationally_guided_personalized_targeted_ablation_of_persistent_atrial_fibrillation","332892483_Multiple_factors_influence_the_morphology_of_the_bipolar_electrogram_An_in_silico_modeling_study","331730617_Effects_of_Heart_Rate_and_Ventricular_Wall_Thickness_on_Non-invasive_Mapping_An_in_silico_Study","341904986_Electrophysiological_significance_of_the_inter-atrial_conduction_including_cavotricuspid_isthmus_during_atrial_fibrillation","335587276_Five-Year_Change_in_the_Renal_Function_After_Catheter_Ablation_of_Atrial_Fibrillation","334150365_Atrial_Fibrillation_Catheter_Ablation_Improves_1-Year_Follow-Up_Cognitive_Function_Especially_in_Patients_With_Impaired_Cognitive_Function","333036906_Atrial_fibrillation_ablation_in_practice_assessing_CABANA_generalizability"]}
