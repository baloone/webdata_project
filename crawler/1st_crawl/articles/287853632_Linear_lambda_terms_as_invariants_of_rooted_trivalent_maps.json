{"id":"287853632_Linear_lambda_terms_as_invariants_of_rooted_trivalent_maps","abstract":"The main aim of the article is to give a simple and conceptual account for\nthe correspondence between ($\\alpha$-equivalence classes of) closed linear\nlambda terms and (isomorphism classes of) rooted trivalent maps on compact\noriented surfaces without boundary, as an instance of a more general\ncorrespondence between linear lambda terms with a context of free variables and\nrooted trivalent maps with a boundary of free edges. We begin by recalling a\nfamiliar diagrammatic representation for linear lambda terms, and explain how\nthese diagrams may be interpreted formally as 1-cells in a symmetric monoidal\nclosed bicategory equipped with a reflexive object. From there, the \"easy\"\ndirection of the correspondence is a simple forgetful operation which erases\nannotations on the diagram of a linear lambda term to produce a rooted\ntrivalent map. The other direction views linear lambda terms as invariants of\ntheir underlying rooted trivalent maps, reconstructing the missing information\nthrough a Tutte-style topological recurrence on maps with free edges. As an\napplication, we show how to use this analysis to enumerate bridgeless rooted\ntrivalent maps as linear lambda terms containing no closed subterms, and\nconclude with a natural reformulation of the Four Color Theorem as a statement\nabout lambda calculus.","authors":["Noam Zeilberger"],"meta":["December 2015Journal of Functional Programming 26","DOI:10.1017/S095679681600023X","SourcearXiv"],"references":["264979636_A_correspondence_between_rooted_planar_maps_and_normal_planar_lambda_terms","248073059_Theory_of_Maps_on_Orientable_Surfaces","233763654_Classical_lambda_calculus_in_modern_dress","222795013_Map_coloring_and_the_vector_cross_product","221583384_From_Hilbert_Spaces_to_Dilbert_Spaces_Context_Semantics_Made_Simple","346678062_Maps_Hypermaps_and_Triangle_Groups","282270585_Counting_isomorphism_classes_of_beta-normal_linear_lambda_terms","267671049_A_Census_of_Hamiltonian_Polygons","266920476_Maps_hypermaps_and_triangle_groups","262315500_Asymptotics_and_random_sampling_for_BCI_and_BCK_lambda_terms","256647422_Braided_Tensor_Categories","251088250_Examples_of_formal_semantics","248390642_Graph_Theory_as_I_Have_Known_It","247381310_Relating_theories_of_the-calculus","247036895_On_The_Enumeration_of_Planar_Maps","245450598_Applications_of_negative-dimensional_tensors","242435377_The_Lambda_Calculus_Its_Syntax_and_Semantics","234060085_Compact_Closed_Bicategories","228929964_The_geometry_of_tensor_calculus_II","220727291_Semantics_of_lambda-I_and_of_other_substructure_lambda_calculi","220676801_Linear_lambda_calculus_and_PTIME-completeness","45868699_A_Survey_of_Graphical_Languages_for_Monoidal_Categories","43795471_Graphs_on_Surfaces_and_Their_Applications","2692149_An_Update_On_The_Four-Color_Theorem","2181282_Lie_Algebras_and_the_Four_Color_Theorem"]}
