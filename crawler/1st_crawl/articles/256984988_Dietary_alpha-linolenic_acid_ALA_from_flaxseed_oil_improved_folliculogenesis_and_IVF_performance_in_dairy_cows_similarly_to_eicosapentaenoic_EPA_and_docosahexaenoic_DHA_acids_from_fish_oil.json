Forty-two 256-day-pregnant cows were supplemented with encapsulated fats, in treatments designated as: (i) SFA - saturated fat at 240 and 560 g/d per cow, prepartum and postpartum, respectively; (ii) FLX - flaxseed oil at 300 and 700 g/d per cow prepartum and postpartum, respectively; (iii) FO - fish oil at 300 and 700 g/d per cow prepartum and postpartum, respectively. Commencing at 60 days in lactation ovum pickup (OPU) was performed twice weekly (20 sessions; 5 cows per group) and in vitro maturation and fertilization were conducted. The proportion of ALA was greater in follicular fluid (FF), granulosa cells and cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) of FLX cows than in other groups (P < 0.001). The proportion of DHA was 6.7 times as great in FF of FO as in other groups (P < 0.001); DPAn-3 and DHA were detected in COCs of FO but not in others. The follicles number during OPU was higher in FLX and FO than in SFA (P < 0.05), and the oocyte cleavage rate was higher in FLX and FO than in SFA (P < 0.01). Also, the percentage of oocytes that developed to blastocysts tended to be higher in both n-3 groups than in SFA (P < 0.1). In conclusion, both dietary n-3 FAs similarly improved folliculogenesis and IVF performance, therefore ALA-rich botanical n-3 seem to be a satisfactory approach to improve oocyte quality.","authors":["Uzi Moallem","Anastasia Shafran","Maya Zachut","Itsik Dekel"],"meta":["September 2013Reproduction (Cambridge, England) 146(6)","DOI:10.1530/REP-13-0244","SourcePubMed"],"references":["295158610_Diverse_Effects_of_Polyunsaturated_Fatty_Acids_on_Oocyte_Maturation_and_Development_In_vitro","227855840_Short_communication_The_effects_of_supplementation_of_various_n-3_fatty_acids_to_late-pregnant_dairy_cows_on_plasma_fatty_acid_composition_of_the_newborn_calves","224865316_Low_numbers_of_ovarian_follicles_3_mm_in_diameter_are_associated_with_low_fertility_in_dairy_cows","43130967_Metabolite_concentrations_in_follicular_fluid_may_explain_differences_in_fertility_between_heifers_and_lactating_cows","41164549_Effects_of_dietary_fats_differing_in_n-6n-3_ratio_fed_to_high-yielding_dairy_cows_on_fatty_acid_composition_of_ovarian_compartments_follicular_status_and_oocyte_quality","26856009_Dietary_omega-3_and_-6_polyunsaturated_fatty_acids_affect_the_composition_and_development_of_sheep_granulosa_cells_oocytes_and_embryos","275625390_Effects_of_dietary_fatty_acids_on_reproduction_in_ruminants","258033308_Effect_of_dietary_supplementation_with_fish_oil_during_the_transition_period_on_milk_production_plasma_metabolites_and_postpartum_anoestrus_interval_in_grazing_dairy_cows","227432645_Effects_of_Maternal_Environment_During_Gestation_on_Ovarian_Folliculogenesis_and_Consequences_for_Fertility_in_Bovine_Offspring","50351130_Incorporation_of_dietary_n-3_fatty_acids_into_ovarian_compartments_in_dairy_cows_and_the_effects_on_hormonal_and_behavioral_patterns_around_estrus"]}
