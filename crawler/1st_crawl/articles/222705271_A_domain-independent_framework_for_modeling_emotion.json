{"id":"222705271_A_domain-independent_framework_for_modeling_emotion","abstract":"In this article, we show how psychological theories of emotion shed light on the interaction between emotion and cognition, and thus can inform the design of human-like autonomous agents that must convey these core aspects of human behavior. We lay out a general computational framework of appraisal and coping as a central organizing principle for such systems. We then discuss a detailed domain-independent model based on this framework, illustrating how it has been applied to the problem of generating behavior for a significant social training application. The model is useful not only for deriving emotional state, but also for informing a number of the behaviors that must be modeled by virtual humans such as facial expressions, dialogue management, planning, reacting, and social understanding. Thus, the work is of potential interest to models of strategic decision-making, action selection, facial animation, and social intelligence.","authors":["Jonathan Gratch","Stacy Marsella"],"meta":["December 2004Cognitive Systems Research 5(4):269-306","DOI:10.1016/j.cogsys.2004.02.002","SourceDBLP"],"references":["291697408_Breaking_the_Tautology_Toward_delivering_on_the_promise_of_appraisal_theory","265702479_Decision-Theoretic_Planning_Structural_Assumptions_and_Computational_Leverage","265074719_Evolutionary_Psychology_and_the_Emotions","245309885_An_Attribution_Theory_of_Motivation_and_Emotion","245229854_Affect_as_information","243773608_A_Componential_Approach_to_the_meaning_of_facial_expressions","242413595_Deictic_and_Emotive_Communication_in_Animated_Pedagogical_Agents","238232607_Feeling_is_Believing_Some_Affective_Influences_on_Belief","235137383_Technical_Details_of_a_Domain-Independent_Framework_for_Modeling_Emotion","232574489_Phenomenology_Behaviors_and_Goals_Differentiate_Discrete_Emotions","232564739_Personality_and_coping_A_reconceptualization","232489124_An_Attribution_Theory_of_Motivation_and_Emotion","232438867_Emotion_and_Adaptation","230613010_Modeling_Coping_Behavior_in_Virtual_Humans_Don't_Worry_Be_Happy","230613009_Intelligent_Agents_for_the_Synthetic_Battlefield","230613005_Fight_the_Way_You_Train_The_Role_and_Limits_of_Emotions_in_Training_for_Combat","229060050_Towards_A_Cognitive_Theory_of_Emotions","229059959_Consequence_Require_Antecedents_Toward_a_Process_Model_of_Emotion_Elicitation","229059939_Emile_Marshalling_passions_in_training_and_education","229059916_The_Affective_Reasoner_A_Process_Model_of_Emotions_in_a_Multi-Agent_System","332918518_Self-Deception_Unmasked","332033031_The_automated_design_of_believable_dialogues_for_animated_presentation_teams","314819675_Negotiation_over_tasks_in_hybrid_human-agent_teams_for_simulation-based_training","314724194_Embodied_agents_for_multi-party_dialogue_in_immersive_virtual_worlds","312893386_Universals_and_cultural_differences_in_facial_expressions_of_emotion","306173633_On_the_nature_and_function_of_emotion_a_component_process_approach","287112582_Sociallysituatedplanning","284675782_Handbook_of_Personality_Theory_and_Research","284052523_Handbook_of_Affective_Sciences","281428402_The_Cognitive_Structure_of_Emotions","248330619_Virtual_Environment_Exposure_Therapy_for_PTSD_Vietnam_Veterans_A_Case_Study","247785619_The_Attribution_of_Blame_Causality_Responsibility_and_Blameworthiness","245457705_Appraisal_Processes_in_Emotion","244446385_Universals_and_cultural_differences_in_facial_expressions_of_emotion","243780964_Passions_with_reason_The_strategic_role_of_emotions","240291642_The_cognitive_structure_of_emotions_Cambridge","239599028_What_is_intention","238695997_Rules_of_the_Mind","238374135_What_is_intention_In_Intentions_in_Communication","236011897_Believable_Social_and_Emotional_Agents_PhD_Thesis","235418766_Coherence_in_Thought_and_Action","235361343_Emotion_and_Personality","232560198_Relational_meaning_and_discrete_emotions","232523240_The_importance_of_affective_communication_in_social_referencing_A_commentary_on_Feinman","229068346_Evaluation_of_environmental_problems_A_coherence_model_of_cognition_and_emotion","229068330_The_Society_of_Mind","229068122_Unified_Theories_of_Cognition","229060093_On_the_Nature_and_Function_of_Emotion_A_Component_Process_Approach","229060026_Expressive_Behaviors_for_Virtual_Worlds","229059977_Beyond_valence_Toward_a_model_of_emotion-specific_influences_on_judgement_and_choice","228954188_Interactive_pedagogical_drama_for_health_interventions","227657116_The_Stress_Appraisal_Measure_SAM_A_multi-dimensional_approach_to_cognitive_appraisal_Special_issue_II-IV_Advances_in_measuring_life_stress","228079345_Appraisal_processes_in_emotion","227637365_Virtual_reality_exposure_therapy_for_PTSD_Vietnam_Veterans_A_case_study","227533980_Virtual_Peers_as_Partners_in_Storytelling_and_Literacy_Learning"]}
