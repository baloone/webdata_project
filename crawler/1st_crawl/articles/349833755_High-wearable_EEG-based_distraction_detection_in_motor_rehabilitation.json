{"id":"349833755_High-wearable_EEG-based_distraction_detection_in_motor_rehabilitation","abstract":"A method for EEG-based distraction detection during motor-rehabilitation tasks is proposed. A wireless cap guarantees very high wearability with dry electrodes and a low number of channels. Experimental validation is performed on a dataset from 17 volunteers. Different feature extractions from spatial, temporal, and frequency domain and classification strategies were evaluated. The performances of five supervised classifiers in discriminating between attention on pure movement and with distractors were compared. A k-Nearest Neighbors classifier achieved an accuracy of 92.8 ± 1.6%. In this last case, the feature extraction is based on a custom 12 pass-band Filter-Bank (FB) and the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm. In particular, the mean Recall of classification (percentage of true positive in distraction detection) is higher than 92% and allows the therapist or an automated system to know when to stimulate the patient’s attention for enhancing the therapy effectiveness.","authors":["Andrea Apicella","Pasquale Arpaia","Mirco Frosolone","Nicola Moccaldi"],"meta":["March 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-84447-8"],"references":["341547708_Behavioral_and_EEG_Measures_Show_no_Amplifying_Effects_of_Shared_Attention_on_Attention_or_Memory","340103843_Comparison_between_a_wireless_dry_electrode_EEG_system_with_a_conventional_wired_wet_electrode_EEG_system_for_clinical_applications","339746102_Induced_Beta_Power_Modulations_during_Isochronous_Auditory_Beats_Reflect_Intentional_Anticipation_before_Gradual_Tempo_Changes","328618814_An_evaluation_of_the_contact_forces_on_the_fingers_when_squeezing_a_spherical_rehabilitation_ball","327467290_EEG_patterns_of_self-paced_movement_imaginations_towards_externally-cued_and_internally-selected_targets","318457301_Impairment_of_Neuroplasticity_in_the_Dorsolateral_Prefrontal_Cortex_by_Alcohol","331187368_Classification_of_Movement_Preparation_Between_Attended_and_Distracted_Self-Paced_Motor_Tasks","320953452_EEG_indices_correlate_with_sustained_attention_performance_in_patients_affected_by_diffuse_axonal_injury","316355075_Classification_of_EEG_signals_to_identify_variations_in_attention_during_motor_task_execution","314693007_Classification_of_Children_with_Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_Using_PCA_and_K-Nearest_Neighbors_During_Interference_Control_Task"]}
