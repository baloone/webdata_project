{"id":"351516336_A_novel_chaotic_image_cryptosystem_based_on_DNA_sequence_operations_and_single_neuron_model","abstract":"In this paper, a novel image cryptosystem based on DNA sequence operations, Single Neuron Model (SNM) and chaotic map is designed. The initial conditions and system parameters of dynamical systems are generated using 512-bit hash value highly dependent to the plain image. We adopted confusion-diffusion as architecture of the algorithm. The 2D Logistic-adjusted-Sine map (2D-LASM) is employed to confuse the pixels of color components simultaneously, while SNM is employed to generate the key stream, otherwise, the hash value of the plain image are injected additionally in diffusion process. Experimental results and relevant security analysis demonstrated that our proposed encryption scheme has the highest security level because it is more sensitive, and it has a key space sufficiently large. The proposed method is compared to other recent image encryption algorithms including different security analysis properties, such as randomness, sensitivity and correlation of the encrypted-images demonstrated that our cryptosystem is efficient, and can overcomes known attacks.","authors":["Nahed Aouf Souayed","Nabil Ben Slimene","Kais Bouallegue","Mohsen Machhout"],"meta":["December 2018Multimedia Tools and Applications 77(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-018-6145-8"],"references":["324041869_A_RGB_image_encryption_technique_using_Lorenz_and_Rossler_chaotic_system_on_DNA_sequences","323925540_Image_encryption_based_on_modified_Henon_map_using_hybrid_chaotic_shift_transform","317769740_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_logistic_map_and_dynatomic_modular_curve","316353607_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_DNA_sequence_operations_and_chaotic_systems","315985769_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_piecewise_linear_chaotic_maps_and_least_squares_approximation","312674504_Designing_a_multi-scroll_chaotic_system_by_operating_Logistic_map_with_fractal_process","314489687_A_new_color_image_encryption_using_combination_of_the_1D_chaotic_map","312312752_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_the_memristive_hyperchaotic_system_cellular_automata_and_DNA_sequence_operations","310585567_A_novel_chaotic_image_encryption_algorithm_using_block_scrambling_and_dynamic_index_based_diffusion","309185198_Image_encryption_using_a_synchronous_permutation-diffusion_technique","307528275_Efficient_cryptosystem_approaches_S-boxes_and_permutation-substitution-based_encryption","305663175_Securing_color_image_by_using_hyperchaotic_system_in_gyrator_transform_domains","288323931_Breaking_a_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_an_improper_fractional_order_chaotic_system","307533293_A_novel_chaos-based_image_encryption_algorithm_using_DNA_sequence_operations","289983310_Image_encryption_using_2D_Logistic-adjusted-Sine_map"]}
