{"id":"283117600_Prevalence_and_recoverability_of_syntactic_parameters_in_sparse_distributed_memories","abstract":"We propose a new method, based on Sparse Distributed Memory (Kanerva\nNetworks), for studying dependency relations between different syntactic\nparameters in the Principles and Parameters model of Syntax. We store data of\nsyntactic parameters of world languages in a Kanerva Network and we check the\nrecoverability of corrupted parameter data from the network. We find that\ndifferent syntactic parameters have different degrees of recoverability. We\nidentify two different effects: an overall underlying relation between the\nprevalence of parameters across languages and their degree of recoverability,\nand a finer effect that makes some parameters more easily recoverable beyond\nwhat their prevalence would indicate. We interpret a higher recoverability for\na syntactic parameter as an indication of the existence of a dependency\nrelation, through which the given parameter can be determined using the\nremaining uncorrupted data.","authors":["Jeong Joon Park","Ronnel Boettcher","Andrew Zhao","Alex Mun"],"meta":["October 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["264312527_Principles_and_Parameters_a_coding_theory_perspective","224313328_AI_and_memory_Studies_towards_equipping_a_robot_with_a_Sparse_Distributed_Memory","215991936_Cultural_Constraints_on_Grammar_and_Cognition_in_Piraha_Another_Look_at_the_Design_Features_of_Human_Language","40853561_Parametric_versus_functional_explanations_of_syntactic_universals","38112825_Memory_Capacities_for_Synaptic_and_Structural_Plasticity","5284369_The_Emergence_of_Language","3303907_Sparse_Distributed_Memory_Using_Rank-Order_Neural_Codes","319394257_Syntax_An_International_Handbook_of_Contemporary_Research","292994736_Basic_Word_Order_Functional_Principles","280695756_Spin_Glass_Models_of_Syntax_and_Language_Evolution","263566348_Artificial_Minds","247932217_The_modi_ed_Kanerva_model_for_automatic_speech_recognition","247784878_The_Atoms_of_Language","246061558_Encoding_Structure_in_Boolean_Space","239064791_Basic_Word_Order_Functional_Principles","231890906_The_change_from_SOV_to_SVO_in_Ancient_Greek","230875924_Lectures_on_Government_and_Binding","221618798_Predicting_Weather_Using_a_Genetic_Memory_A_Combination_of_Kanerva's_Sparse_Distributed_Memory_with_Holland's_Genetic_Algorithms","220531699_The_Cross-Linguistic_Prevalence_of_SOV_and_SVO_Word_Orders_Reflects_the_Sequential_and_Hierarchical_Representation_of_Action_in_Broca's_Area","40853575_The_World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures_Online","24301472_Sparse_Distributed_Memory_and_Related_Models","24293455_Capacity_for_patterns_and_sequences_in_Kanerva's_SDM_as_compared_to_other_associative_memory_models","23702642_Sparse_Distributed_Memory","10688003_Does_Broca's_play_by_the_rules","5595879_A_new_approach_to_Kanerva's_sparse_distributed_memory","3077357_Capacity_of_the_Kanerva_associative_memory"]}
