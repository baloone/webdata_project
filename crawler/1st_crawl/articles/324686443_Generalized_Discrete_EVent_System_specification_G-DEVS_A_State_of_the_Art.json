{"id":"324686443_Generalized_Discrete_EVent_System_specification_G-DEVS_A_State_of_the_Art","abstract":"The Generalized Discrete Event System specification (G-DEVS) language was introduced by Norbert Giambiasi in the 1990s. This paper first examines the specification of G-DEVS and gives an historical view of N. Giambiasi’s works that contributed to this concept. The paper particularly focuses on the extension of G-DEVS to distributed simulation. An example of a G-DEVS model of a filling system with a conveyor belt, a tank, and a valve is proposed to show the accuracy gained by using G-DEVS instead of other classical discrete event modeling formalisms. Then, the paper presents how G-DEVS has been extended for interoperability with other components in the context of supply chain M&S coping, with the possibility to compose different model formats at simulation time. Next, the focus is on a G–DEVS editor tool and its extensions: LSIS_DME. The distributed simulation and the HLA standard were used to support the interoperability of various models and simulators.","authors":["Gregory Zacharewicz"],"meta":["April 2018SIMULATION: Transactions of The Society for Modeling and Simulation International","DOI:10.1177/0037549718777626","Project: DEVS G-DEVS Distributed Simulation Structure based on HLA"],"references":["271767758_Business_process_simulation_Transformation_of_BPMN_20_to_DEVS_models_WIP","243547056_Theory_of_Modeling_and_Simulation_Integrating_Discrete_Event_and_Continuous_Complex_Dynamic_Systems","238701979_System_Theoretic_Formalisms_for_Combined_Discrete-Continuous_System_Simulation","238123651_Theory_of_Modeling_and_Simulation_2nd_Edition","316910155_Towards_a_Discrete_Event_Formalization_of_Sachem's_Perception_Based_Monitoring","316083296_Generalized_Discrete_Events_for_Accurate_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Logic_Gates_Maamar_El_Amine_Hamri_Norbert_Giambiasi_Aziz_Naamane","316012576_GDEVS_A_Generalized_Discrete_Event_Specification_for_Accurate_Modeling_of_Dynamic_systems","300899168_Generalized_Discrete_Events_for_Accurate_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Logic_Gates","242326004_Theory_of_quantized_systems_Formal_basis_for_DEVSHLA_distributed_simulation_environment","235949931_Workflow_Management_Coalition_Workflow_Standard_Workflow_Process_Definition_Interface_--_XML_Process_Definition_Language_XPDL_WFMC-TC-1025"]}
