{"id":"301402856_A_transformative_approach_to_capstone_projects_in_engineering","abstract":"Engineering Institutions provide a rich human capital that can source research and innovation. Organizations build further on this, to ultimately realize game changing products that makes a lot of difference in the lives of people. As a part of the engineering curriculum, many exciting capstone projects are currently being executed that contribute to the ecosystem of technological advancement. An explicit direction or vision in these pursuits with tangible benefits to all the stake holders can be brought forth through a transformative alternate approach at the institutional level. This paper presents a new paradigm that can bring about a sea change in the way projects are selected, executed and handed over to the industry /research for consummation on a larger scale. This can also lead to profound and lasting impacts in the learning experience.","authors":["Kishan Malur","Alumnus","Meena Parathodiyil","Ravishankar Deekshit"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1109/MITE.2014.7020301","Conference: 2014 IEEE International Conference on MOOC, Innovation and Technology in Education (MITE)"],"references":[]}
