{"id":"325222268_Research_Landscape_of_Business_Intelligence_and_Big_Data_Analytics_A_Bibliometrics_Study","abstract":"Business Intelligence that applies data analytics to generate key information to support business decision making, has been an important area for more than two decades. In the last five years, the trend of “Big Data” has emerged and become a core element of Business Intelligence research. In this article, we review academic literature associated with “Big Data” and “Business Intelligence” to explore the development and research trends. We use bibliometric methods to analyze publications from 1990 to 2017 in journals indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). We map the time trend, disciplinary distribution, high-frequency keywords to show emerging topics. The findings indicate that Computer Science and management information systems are two core disciplines that drive research associated with Big Data and Business Intelligence. “Data mining”, “social media” and “information system” are high frequency keywords, but “cloud computing”, “data warehouse” and “knowledge management” are more emphasized after 2016.","authors":["Ting-Peng Liang","Yu-Hsi Liu"],"meta":["May 2018Expert Systems with Applications 111(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2018.05.018"],"references":["320447184_Big_Data_Analytics_and_Business_Intelligence_in_Industry","305371728_Game_Learning_Analytics_Learning_Analytics_for_Serious_Games","280599074_Tourism_analytics_with_massive_user-generated_content_A_case_study_of_Barcelona","268453073_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Decision_Support_Systems_Research_Revisited_The_Rise_of_Design_Science","333127700_Electronic_Commerce_Research_Profiles_Comparing_E-Commerce_and_Information_Systems_Journals","333007645_Combining_Online_News_Articles_and_Web_Search_to_Predict_the_Fluctuation_of_Real_Estate_Market_in_Big_Data_Context","322901973_Retail_Business_Analytics_Customer_Visit_Segmentation_Using_Market_Basket_Data","314966300_Tunable_pore_sizes_of_monodispersed_amorphous_calcium_phosphate_hollow_nanospheres","313030909_BI4BI_A_Continuous_Evaluation_System_for_Business_Intelligence_Systems","305733389_Risk_Intelligence_in_Big_Data_Era_A_Review_and_Introduction_to_Special_Issue","284679162_Business_Intelligence_and_Analytics_From_Big_Data_to_Big_Impact","282754038_A_hybrid_PBIL-based_krill_herd_algorithm","279271716_A_business_intelligence_approach_using_web_search_tools_and_online_data_reduction_techniques_to_examine_the_value_of_product-enabled_services","271603353_Exploring_managers'_intention_to_use_business_intelligence_The_role_of_motivations","266857694_Business_intelligence_in_banking_A_literature_analysis_from_2002_to_2013_using_text_mining_and_latent_Dirichlet_allocation","266322624_Big_Data_with_Cloud_Computing_An_insight_on_the_computing_environment_MapReduce_and_programming_frameworks","265909962_Big_data_analytics_for_knowledge_generation_in_tourism_destinations_-_A_case_from_Sweden","263653015_Enhancing_Business_Intelligence_Quality_with_Visualization_An_Experiment_on_Stakeholder_Network_Analysis","257692573_Big_Data_Unleashing_information","257404669_Effects_of_data_set_features_on_the_performances_of_classification_algorithms","200121136_A_Business_Intelligence_System"]}
