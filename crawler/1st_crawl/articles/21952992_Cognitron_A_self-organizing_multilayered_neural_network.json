{"id":"21952992_Cognitron_A_self-organizing_multilayered_neural_network","abstract":"A new hypothesis for the organization of synapses between neurons is proposed: The synapse from neuron x to neuron y is reinforced when x fires provided that no neuron in the vicinity of y is firing stronger than y. By introducing this hypothesis, a new algorithm with which a multilayered neural network is effectively organized can be deduced. A self-organizing multilayered neural network, which is named cognitron, is constructed following this algorithm, and is simulated on a digital computer. Unlike the organization of a usual brain models such as a three-layered perceptron, the self-organization of a cognitron progresses favorably without having a teacher which instructs in all particulars how the individual cells respond. After repetitive presentations of several stimulus patterns, the cognitron is self-organized in such a way that the receptive fields of the cells become relatively larger in a deeper layer. Each cell in the final layer integrates the information from whole parts of the first layer and selectively responds to a specific stimulus pattern or a feature.","authors":["Kunihiko Fukushima"],"meta":["December 1975Biological Cybernetics 20(3-4):121-36","DOI:10.1007/BF00342633","SourcePubMed"],"references":["226282988_Self-organization_of_orientation_sensitive_cells_in_striate_cortex","51273162_Development_of_the_Brain_Depends_on_the_Visual_Environment","285058764_Receptive_fields_binocular_interaction_and_functional_architecture_in_the_cat's_visual_cortex","275807826_Principles_of_Neurodynamics","274941470_Feature_Extractor_for_Pattern_Recognizer_and_Animal's_Visual_System","272159781_Wiesel_TN_Receptive_fields_binocular_interaction_and_functional_architecture_in_cat's_visual_cortex_J_Physiol_London_160_106-154","248850770_Receptive_fields_of_single_neurones_in_cat''''s_visual_cortex","245683212_Cognition_A_self-organizing_multilayered_neural_network","238980187_Analysis_of_a_Four-Layer_Series-Coupled_Perceptron_II","229091433_Principles_of_Neurodynamics_Perceptrons_and_the_Theory_of_Brain_Mechanisms","18770727_A_Theory_for_Cerebral_Neocortex","18381312_Self-organization_of_orientation_sensitive_cells_in_the_striate_cortex","17672260_A_feature_extractor_for_curvilinear_patterns_a_design_suggested_by_the_mammalian_visual_system","17402408_A_Theory_of_Cerebellar_Cortex","9301289_Receptive_Fields_and_Functional_Architecture_in_Two_Nonstriate_Visual_Areas_18_and_19_of_the_Cat","9184022_Receptive_fields_of_single_neurons_in_the_cat's_striate_cortex","9137961_Receptive_fields_binocular_interaction_and_functional_architectures_in_cats_visual_cortex","3479451_Visual_Feature_Extraction_by_a_Multilayered_Network_of_Analog_Threshold_Elements"]}
