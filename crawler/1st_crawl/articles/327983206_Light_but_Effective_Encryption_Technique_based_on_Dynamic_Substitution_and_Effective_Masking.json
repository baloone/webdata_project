{"id":"327983206_Light_but_Effective_Encryption_Technique_based_on_Dynamic_Substitution_and_Effective_Masking","abstract":"Cryptography and cryptanalysis are in ever-lasting struggle. As the encryption techniques advance, the cryptanalysis techniques advance as well. To properly face the great danger of the cryptanalysis techniques, we should diligently look for more effective encryption techniques. These techniques must properly handle any weaknesses that may be exploited by hacking tools. We address this problem by proposing an innovative encryption technique. Our technique has unique features that make it different from the other standard encryption methods. Our method advocates the use of dynamic substitution and tricky manipulation operations that introduce tremendous confusion and diffusion to ciphertext. All this is augmented with an effective key expansion that not only allows for implicit embedment of the key in all of the encryption steps but also produces very different versions of this key. Experiments with our proof-ofconcept prototype showed that our method is effective and passes very important security tests.
