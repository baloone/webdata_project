{"id":"4305477_Fast_and_reliable_plagiarism_detection_system","abstract":"Plagiarism and similarity detection software is well-known in universities for years. Despite the variety of methods and approaches used in plagiarism detection, the typical trade-off between the speed and the reliability of the algorithm still remains. We introduce a new two-step approach to plagiarism detection that combines high algorithmic performance and the quality of pairwise file comparison. Our system uses fast detection method to select suspicious files only, and then invokes precise (and slower) algorithms to get reliable results. We show that the proposed method does not noticeably reduce the quality of the pairwise comparison mechanism while providing better speed characteristics.","authors":["Maxim Mozgovoy","S.
