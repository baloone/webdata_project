{"id":"302869397_Tolerance_Analysis_by_Polytopes_Application_to_Assembly_Interferences_Diagnosis","abstract":"One way to perform tolerance analysis on over-constrained mechanical systems is to manipulate sets of constraints. During the 25 last years, several models (domains by Giordano et al., polytopes by Teissandier et al. or T-Maps by Davidson et al.), have been developed to control the assembly of parts without contact interferences. In general, if the intersection between sets of contact constraints is non empty, it is possible to perform an assembly made up of two parts without interference. Then, several works have been realized to qualify the clearance of the assembly. On the other hand, if the intersection is an empty set, it is not possible to perform the assembly between two parts without interference (i.e. without induced strains by the assembly process). This paper will focus on the diagnosis of such empty sets.","authors":["Doriane Gouyou","Denis Teissandier","Vincent Delos"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia CIRP 43:52-57","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2016.02.019","Projects: Tolerance Analysis by PolytopesPolitoCAT project : i2m.u-bordeaux.fr/politopix"],"references":["236660886_A_Study_of_Optimal-Criteria_Identification_Based_on_the_Small-Displacement_Screw_Model","275087535_Comparison_of_Two_Similar_Mathematical_Models_for_Tolerance_Analysis_T-Map_and_Deviation_Domain","269730530_Tolerance_Analysis_by_Polytopes_Taking_into_account_degrees_of_freedom_with_cap_half-spaces","260082669_Lectures_on_Polytopes","236660958_Clearance_Space_in_Volumic_Dimensioning","236660936_A_Feasability_Space_Appoach_for_Automated_Tolerancing","236660853_Lecture_Notes_in_Mechanical_Engineering","236660838_A_New_Mathematical_Model_for_Geometric_Tolerances_as_Applied_to_Round_Faces","222085207_Improvements_to_algorithms_for_computing_the_Minkowski_sum_of_3-polytopes","220582483_Algorithm_to_calculate_the_Minkowski_sums_of_3-polytopes_based_on_normal_fans"]}
