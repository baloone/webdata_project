{"id":"284766755_Chaos_synchronization_in_networks_of_semiconductor_superlattices","abstract":"Chaos synchronization has been demonstrated as a useful building block for various tasks in secure communications, including a source of all-electronic ultrafast physical random number generators based on room temperature spontaneous chaotic oscillations in a DC-biased weakly coupled GaAs/Al0.45Ga0.55As semiconductor superlattice (SSL). Here, we experimentally demonstrate the emergence of several types of chaos synchronization, e.g. leader-laggard, face-to-face and zero-lag synchronization in network motifs of coupled SSLs consisting of unidirectional and mutual coupling as well as self-feedback coupling. Each type of synchronization clearly reflects the symmetry of the topology of its network motif. The emergence of a chaotic SSL without external feedback and synchronization among different structured SSLs open up the possibility for advanced secure multi-user communication methods based on large networks of coupled SSLs.","authors":["Wen Li","Yaara Aviad","Igor Reidler","Helun Song"],"meta":["November 2015EPL (Europhysics Letters) 112(3):30007","DOI:10.1209/0295-5075/112/30007"],"references":["264244498_Noise-enhanced_spontaneous_chaos_in_semiconductor_superlattices_at_room_temperature","262985231_Experimental_evidence_for_coherence_resonance_in_a_noise-driven_GaAsAlAs_superlattice","261405123_Subterahertz_Chaos_Generation_by_Coupling_a_Superlattice_to_a_Linear_Resonator","258266003_Non-linear_dynamics_of_semiconductor_superlattices","257688797_Experimental_observation_of_spontaneous_chaotic_current_oscillations_in_GaAsAl045Ga055As_superlattices_at_room_temperature","255732914_Fast_Physical_Random-Number_Generation_Based_on_Room-Temperature_Chaotic_Oscillations_in_Weakly_Coupled_Superlattices","268894504_Cryptography_Theory_and_practice_3rd_ed","265501991_Principles_of_Digital_Communication","257954603_Spontaneous_quasi-periodic_current_self-oscillations_in_a_weakly_coupled_GaAsAlGaAs_superlattice_at_room_temperature","243466465_New_Transport_Phenomenon_in_a_Semiconductor"]}
