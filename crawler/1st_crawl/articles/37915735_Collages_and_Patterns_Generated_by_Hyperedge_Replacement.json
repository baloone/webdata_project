{"id":"37915735_Collages_and_Patterns_Generated_by_Hyperedge_Replacement","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce and study the notion of collage grammars. A collage, in our sense, consists essentially of a set of parts being geometric objects and a set of hyperedges being subjects of further replacement. A set of collages represents a set of geometric patterns where each pattern is just the union of the parts of a collage. By overlay of the represented patterns, a set of collages yields a fractal pattern. Sets of collages can be generated by collage grammars in the usual way of grammars as language-generating device. As collages represent patterns that may be overlaid in addition, collage grammars provide also syntactic devices for the generation of sets of patterns as well as a certain type of fractal patterns.","authors":["Annegret Habel","Hans-Joerg Kreowski","Stefan Taubenberger"],"meta":["April 1993"],"references":[]}
