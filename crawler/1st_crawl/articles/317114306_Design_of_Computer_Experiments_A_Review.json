{"id":"317114306_Design_of_Computer_Experiments_A_Review","abstract":"In this article, we present a detailed overview of the literature on the design of computer experiments. We classify the existing literature broadly into two categories, viz. static and adaptive design of experiments (DoE). We begin with the abundant literature available on static DoE, its chronological evolution, and its pros and cons. Our discussion naturally points to the challenges that are faced by the static techniques. The adaptive DoE techniques employ intelligent and iterative strategies to address these challenges by combining system knowledge with space-filling for sample placement. We critically analyze the adaptive DoE literature based on the key features of placement strategies. Our numerical and visual analyses of the static DoE techniques reveal the excellent performance of Sobol sampling (SOB3) for higher dimensions; and that of Hammersley (HAM) and Halton (HAL) sampling for lower dimensions. Finally, we provide several potential opportunities for the future modern DoE research.","authors":["Sushant S.
