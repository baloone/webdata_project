{"id":"320570339_Calculating_Completeness_of_Agile_Scope_in_Scaled_Agile_Development","abstract":"Flexible nature of scope definition in agile makes it difficult or impossible to measure its quality and completeness. The aim of this paper is to highlight the important ingredients of scope definition for agile projects and to present a method in order to measure the quality and completeness of their scope definitions. The proposed method considers the elements that are retrieved as a result of the systematic literature review. An industrial survey is conducted to validate and prioritize these elements. Elements are then assigned weights according to their importance in scope definition to build a scorecard for calculating the score of user stories present in the product backlog. Proposed method is able to identify the clear and complete user stories that can better be implemented in the coming iteration. Formal experiments are performed for evaluation of the proposed method and it suggests that the method is useful for experts in order to quantify the quality and completeness of scope definition of an agile software project.","authors":["Sunnia Amjad","Naveed Ahmad","Tanzila Saba","Adeel Anjum"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2765351"],"references":["309242218_Towards_a_research_agenda_for_adopting_Agile_Project_Management_in_Creative_Industries","349859798_Project_Scope_Management_A_Practical_Guide_to_Requirements_for_Engineering_Product_Construction_IT_and_Enterprise_Projects","344522485_The_ScrumMaster_Study_Guide","344500729_The_Art_of_Agile_Practice_A_Composite_Approach_for_Projects_and_Organizations","326693427_Development_of_the_Project_Definition_Rating_Index_PDRI_for_Infrastructure_Projects","320496611_Calculating_Completeness_of_Software_Project_Scope_Definition","316368557_Agile_Development_in_the_Real_World","315740342_Are_You_Biting_Off_More_Than_You_Can_Chew_A_Case_Study_on_Causes_and_Effects_of_Overscoping_in_Large-Scale_Software_Engineering","314361417_Functional_Size_Measurement_Methods_FSMMs","308864410_Risk_management_in_Agile_software_development_A_comparative_study"]}
