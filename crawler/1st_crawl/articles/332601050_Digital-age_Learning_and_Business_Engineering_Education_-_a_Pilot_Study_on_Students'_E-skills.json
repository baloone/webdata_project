The study aims to investigate the business engineering students self-perceptions related to certain digital skills as information and data processing, digital communication, digital content creation, and digital problem solving. The results enable to assess the digital learning needs which can be used to further improve teaching and learning activities in different business engineering disciplines and also in manufacturing education. Finally, the authors share their perspectives on digital readiness in business engineering education which involves adaptation and change, and needs significant willingness and effort to be scaled up.","authors":["Fleaca Elena","Radu Stanciu"],"meta":["January 2019Procedia Manufacturing 32:1051-1057","DOI:10.1016/j.promfg.2019.02.320"],"references":["323546570_Entrepreneurship_Education_An_Experimental_Study_with_Information_and_Communication_Technology","316772575_Modeling_Stakeholders_Relationships_to_Strengthen_the_Entrepreneurial_Behavior_of_Higher_Education_Institutions","295084649_The_Challenges_of_Romanian_Higher_Education_-_A_Review_on_the_Key_Enablers_for_Modernization","295010417_Promoting_Effective_Digital-Age_Learning_-_A_European_Framework_for_Digitally-Competent_Educational_Organisations","273727232_From_Traditional_to_Digital_The_Labour_Market_Demands_and_Education_Expectations_in_an_EU_Context"]}
