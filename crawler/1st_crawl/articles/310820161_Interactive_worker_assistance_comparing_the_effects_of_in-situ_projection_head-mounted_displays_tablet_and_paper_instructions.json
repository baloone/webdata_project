Different instruction systems for the workplace provide instructions on phones, tablets, and head-mounted displays (HMDs). Recently, many systems using in-situ projection for providing assembly instructions at the workplace have been proposed and became commercially available. Although comprehensive studies comparing HMD and tablet-based systems have been presented, in-situ projection has not been scientifically compared against state-of-the-art approaches yet. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by comparing HMD instructions, tablet instructions, and baseline paper instructions to in-situ projected instructions using an abstract Lego Duplo assembly task. Our results show that assembling parts is significantly faster using in-situ projection and locating positions is significantly slower using HMDs. Further, participants make less errors and have less perceived cognitive load using in-situ instructions compared to HMD instructions.","authors":["Markus Funk","Thomas Kosch","Albrecht Schmidt"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1145/2971648.2971706","Conference: the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference"],"references":["308504379_Using_In-Situ_Projection_to_Support_Cognitively_Impaired_Workers_at_the_Workplace","308416722_A_benchmark_for_interactive_augmented_reality_instructions_for_assembly_tasks","303803052_Augmented_reality_an_application_of_heads-up_display_technology_to_manual_manufacturing_processes","301683109_Pick_from_here_an_interactive_mobile_cart_using_in-situ_projection_for_order_picking","282323821_Extending_the_Design_Space_in_Industrial_Manufacturing_Through_Mobile_Projection","244486245_The_Potentials_of_In-Situ-Projection_for_Augmented_Workplaces_in_Production_A_Study_with_Impaired_Persons","300730352_Eye-Wearable_Technology_for_Machine_Maintenance","271867751_Evaluating_virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality_training_for_industrial_maintenance_and_assembly_tasks","261855441_DuploTrack_A_real-time_system_for_authoring_and_guiding_duplo_block_assembly","261111896_Improving_procedural_task_performance_with_Augmented_Reality_annotations"]}
