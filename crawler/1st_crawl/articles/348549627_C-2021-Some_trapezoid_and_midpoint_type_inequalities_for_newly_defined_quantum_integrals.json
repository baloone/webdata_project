{"id":"348549627_C-2021-Some_trapezoid_and_midpoint_type_inequalities_for_newly_defined_quantum_integrals","abstract":"In this paper, we first obtain prove two new identities for the quantum integrals. Then we establish Trapezoid and Midpoint type inequalities for quantum integrals defined by Bermudo et al. in [3]. The inequalities in this study generalize some results obtained in earlier works","authors":["HÃ¼seyin Budak"],"meta":["January 2021Proyecciones (Antofagasta) 40(1)","DOI:10.22199/issn.0717-6279-2021-01-0013"],"references":["330905703_Some_Quantum_Estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard_Inequalities_for_Quasi-Convex_Functions","329814922_HERMITE_HADAMARD'S_TYPE_INEQUALITIES_FOR_CO-ORDINATED_CONVEX_FUNCTIONS_ON_QUANTUM_INTEGRAL","310673161_Quantum_Ostrowski_inequalities_for_q-differentiable_convex_functions","308912178_q-Hermite_Hadamard_inequalities_and_quantum_estimates_for_midpoint_type_inequalities_via_convex_and_quasi-convex_functions","281759795_Quantum_integral_inequalities_for_convex_functions","280831870_Some_quantum_integral_inequalities_via_preinvex_functions","270464054_Quantum_calculus_on_finite_intervals_and_applications_to_impulsive_difference_equations","269889467_Some_quantum_estimates_for_Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities","339281527_On_q-Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities_for_general_convex_functions","268159342_A_Comprehensive_Treatment_of_q-Calculus"]}
