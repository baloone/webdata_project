{"id":"322042710_Stress-_strain_function_for_the_fatigue_of_metals","abstract":"A recently suggested stress- strain function governing fatigue is extended to include the effect of mean stress. This function is probably valid, at least in the engineering sense, for the crack initiation stage and the early part of crack propagation. A procedure for cumulative damage summation in terms of this function is presented. The proposal is tested against various metals (steels and aluminum alloys) and loading conditions.","authors":["SMITH KN","WATSON P","TOPPER TH"],"meta":["December 1970"],"references":[]}
