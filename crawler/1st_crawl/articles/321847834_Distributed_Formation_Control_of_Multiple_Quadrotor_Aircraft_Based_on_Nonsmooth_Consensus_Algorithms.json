{"id":"321847834_Distributed_Formation_Control_of_Multiple_Quadrotor_Aircraft_Based_on_Nonsmooth_Consensus_Algorithms","abstract":"The problem of distributed formation control for multiple quadrotor aircraft in the form of leader-follower structure is considered in this paper. Based on a nonsmooth backstepping design, a novel consensus formation control algorithm is proposed and utilized. First, for the position control subsystem, based on the linear quadratic regulator optimal design method, a formation control law for multiple quadrotor aircraft is designed such that the positions of all the quadrotor aircraft converge to the desired formation pattern. The designed formation control law for position systems will generate the desired attitude for the attitude control systems. Second, for the attitude control subsystem described by unit quaternion, by employing the technique of finite-time control and switch control, a global bounded finite-time attitude tracking controller is designed such that the desired attitude can be tracked by the multiple quadrotor aircraft in finite time. Finally, numerical example is performed to demonstrate that all quadrotor aircraft converge to the desired formation pattern in the 3-D-space.","authors":["Haibo Du","Wenwu Zhu","Guanghui Wen","Zhisheng Duan"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics PP(99):1-12","DOI:10.1109/TCYB.2017.2777463"],"references":["313741232_Hovering_control_for_quadrotor_aircraft_based_on_finite-time_control_algorithm","260586187_Integrated_Optimal_Formation_Control_of_Multiple_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","233460490_Optimum_design_of_three-dimensional_behavioural_decentralized_controller_for_UAV_formation_flight","3704287_Finite-time_stability_of_homogeneous_systems","3332820_Design_and_Flight_Testing_Evaluation_of_Formation_Control_Laws","3332722_Attitude_stabilization_of_a_VTOL_quadrotor_aircraft","317671186_Integral_Sliding_Mode_Flight_Controller_Design_for_A_Quadrotor_and_the_Application_in_A_Heterogeneous_Multi-Agent_System","316449882_Robust_Adaptive_Hierarchical_Insensitive_Tracking_Control_of_a_Class_of_Leader-Follower_Agents","314243824_Motion_Coordination_for_VTOL_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","312489867_Integrated_optimal_formation_control_of_multiple_unmanned_aerial_vehicles","311548440_Design_and_Implementation_of_Nonuniform_Sampling_Cooperative_Control_on_A_Group_of_Two-Wheeled_Mobile_Robots","309281809_Distributed_Adaptive_Control_of_Multi-agent_Systems","309055805_Cooperative_Control_of_Mobile_Sensor_Networks_for_Environmental_Monitoring_An_Event-Triggered_Finite-Time_Control_Scheme","305674862_Control_of_a_hovering_quadrotor_aircraft_based_finite-time_attitude_control_algorithm","299544941_Finite-Time_Control_for_Robust_Tracking_Consensus_in_MASs_With_an_Uncertain_Leader","293009273_Attitude_Synchronization_for_Flexible_Spacecraft_With_Communication_Delays","290991709_Robust_Three-Loop_Trajectory_Tracking_Control_for_Quadrotors_With_Multiple_Uncertainties","284206576_Vision-Based_Target_Detection_and_Localization_via_a_Team_of_Cooperative_UAV_and_UGVs","283827509_Finite-time_attitude_stabilization_for_a_spacecraft_using_homogeneous_method","282522311_Containment_of_Higher-Order_Multi-Leader_Multi-Agent","282432027_Nonsmooth_Finite-Time_Synchronization_of_Switched_Coupled_Neural_Networks","275055869_Nonlinear_Robust_Adaptive_Tracking_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_UAV_Via_Immersion_and_Invariance_Methodology","272239588_Consensus_in_second-order_multiple_flying_vehicles_with_random_delays_governed_by_a_Markov_chain","271603322_Coordination_control_of_quadrotor_VTOL_aircraft_in_three-dimensional_space","264743751_Distributed_Finite-Time_Containment_Control_for_Double-Integrator_Multiagent_Systems","260541930_Distributed_Cohesive_Motion_Control_of_Flight_Vehicle_Formations","260535144_Adaptive_Control_of_Quadrotor_UAVs_A_Design_Trade_Study_with_Flight_Evaluations","260389700_Motion_Coordination_for_VTOL_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles_Attitude_Synchronization_and_Formation_Control","260264152_Modelling_and_Control_of_Mini-Flying_Machines","258329076_Distributed_Consensus_in_Multi-Vehicle_Cooperative_Control","253512057_A_Survey_of_Attitude_Representations","239787856_Robust_consensus_algorithm_for_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_external_disturbances","228800084_Control_of_Formations_of_UAVs_for_Surveillance_and_Reconnaissance_Missions","222834006_Finite-time_control_for_robot_manipulators","221932985_Matrix_Analysis","30858526_Finite-Time_Stability_of_Continuous_Autonomous_Systems","3332309_A_Coordination_Architecture_for_Spacecraft_Formation_Control"]}
