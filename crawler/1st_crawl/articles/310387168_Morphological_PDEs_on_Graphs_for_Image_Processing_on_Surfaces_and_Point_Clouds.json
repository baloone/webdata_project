{"id":"310387168_Morphological_PDEs_on_Graphs_for_Image_Processing_on_Surfaces_and_Point_Clouds","abstract":"Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)-based morphology offers a wide range of continuous operators to address various image processing problems. Most of these operators are formulated as Hamilton-Jacobi equations or curve evolution level set and morphological flows. In our previous works, we have proposed a simple method to solve PDEs on point clouds using the framework of PdEs (Partial difference Equations) on graphs. In this paper, we propose to apply a large class of morphological-based operators on graphs for processing raw 3D point clouds and extend their applications for the processing of colored point clouds of geo-informatics 3D data. Through illustrations, we show that this simple framework can be used in the resolution of many applications for geo-informatics purposes.","authors":["Abderrahim Elmoataz","Fran√ßois Lozes","Hugues Talbot"],"meta":["November 2016International Journal of Geo-Information 5(11):213","DOI:10.3390/ijgi5110213"],"references":["308006018_Nonlocal_PDEs_on_Graphs_From_Tug-of-War_Games_to_Unified_Interpolation_on_Images_and_Point_Clouds","281598232_Morphological_PDE_and_DilationErosion_Semigroups_on_Length_Spaces","281290349_On_the_p-Laplacian_and_-Laplacian_on_graphs_with_Applications_in_Image_and_Data_Processing","278737399_PDE-based_Graph_Signal_Processing_for_3D_Color_Point_Clouds_Opportunities_for_Cultural_Heritage","276020330_An_automatic_and_modular_stereo_pipeline_for_pushbroom_images","263896198_Partial_Difference_Operators_on_Weighted_Graphs_for_Image_Processing_on_Surfaces_and_Point_Clouds","310487702_Fronts_propagating_with_curve-dependent_speed_algorithms_based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulations","303491205_Some_properties_of_viscosity_solutions_of_Hamilton-Jacobi_equations","286679738_Unsupervised_feature_learning_for_3D_scene_labeling","275173290_Viscosity_Solutions_of_Hamilton-Jacobi_Equations_in_Banach_Spaces"]}
