{"id":"333683809_Combining_gene_ontology_with_deep_neural_networks_to_enhance_the_clustering_of_single_cell_RNA-Seq_data","abstract":"Background\nSingle cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is applied to assay the individual transcriptomes of large numbers of cells. The gene expression at single-cell level provides an opportunity for better understanding of cell function and new discoveries in biomedical areas. To ensure that the single-cell based gene expression data are interpreted appropriately, it is crucial to develop new computational methods.\n\nResults\nIn this article, we try to re-construct a neural network based on Gene Ontology (GO) for dimension reduction of scRNA-seq data. By integrating GO with both unsupervised and supervised models, two novel methods are proposed, named GOAE (Gene Ontology AutoEncoder) and GONN (Gene Ontology Neural Network) respectively.\n\nConclusions\nThe evaluation results show that the proposed models outperform some state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Furthermore, incorporating with GO, we provide an opportunity to interpret the underlying biological mechanism behind the neural network-based model.","authors":["Jiajie Peng","Xiaoyu Wang","Xuequn Shang"],"meta":["June 2019BMC Bioinformatics 20(S8)","DOI:10.1186/s12859-019-2769-6"],"references":["330633397_Identification_of_Alzheimer's_Disease-Related_Genes_Based_on_Data_Integration_Method","328662468_LncRNA2Target_v20_a_comprehensive_database_for_target_genes_of_lncRNAs_in_human_and_mouse","324443556_Measuring_phenotype-phenotype_similarity_through_the_interactome","323957541_Improving_the_measurement_of_semantic_similarity_by_combining_gene_ontology_and_co-functional_network_A_random_walk_based_approach","323562381_Using_deep_learning_to_model_the_hierarchical_structure_and_function_of_a_cell","322700123_DincRNA_A_comprehensive_web-based_bioinformatics_toolkit_for_exploring_disease_associations_and_ncRNA_function","320235234_Network_embedding-based_representation_learning_for_single_cell_RNA-seq_data","317114002_A_novel_method_to_measure_the_semantic_similarity_of_HPO_terms","317100618_SC3_consensus_clustering_of_single-cell_RNA-seq_data","320689720_Using_neural_networks_for_reducing_the_dimensions_of_single-cell_RNA-Seq_data"]}
