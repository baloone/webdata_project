{"id":"356144893_Context_aware_semantic_adaptation_network_for_cross_domain_implicit_sentiment_classification","abstract":"Cross-domain sentiment classification could be attributed to two steps. The first step is used to extract the text representation, and the other is to reduce domain discrepancy. Existing methods mostly focus on learning the domain-invariant information, rarely consider using the domain-specific semantic information, which could help cross-domain sentiment classification; traditional adversarial-based models merely focus on aligning the global distribution ignore maximizing the class-specific decision boundaries. To solve these problems, we propose a context-aware semantic adaptation (CASA) network for cross-domain implicit sentiment classification (ISC). CASA can provide more semantic relationships and an accurate understanding of the emotion-changing process for ISC tasks lacking explicit emotion words. (1) To obtain inter- and intrasentence semantic associations, our model builds a context-aware heterogeneous graph (CAHG), which can aggregate the intrasentence dependency information and the intersentence node interaction information, followed by an attention mechanism that remains high-level domain-specific features. (2) Moreover, we conduct a new multigrain discriminator (MGD) to effectively reduce the interdomain distribution discrepancy and improve intradomain class discrimination. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules compared with existing models on the Chinese implicit emotion dataset and four public explicit datasets.","authors":["Enguang Zuo","Alimjan Aysa","Mahpirat Muhammat","Yuxia Zhao"],"meta":["November 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-01385-1"],"references":["351568404_Positionless_aspect_based_sentiment_analysis_using_attention_mechanism","343300807_Every_Document_Owns_Its_Structure_Inductive_Text_Classification_via_Graph_Neural_Networks","342536243_Tensor_Graph_Convolutional_Networks_for_Text_Classification","348506965_Phonetic-enriched_text_representation_for_Chinese_sentiment_analysis_with_reinforcement_learning","347309411_Investigating_Typed_Syntactic_Dependencies_for_Targeted_Sentiment_Classification_Using_Graph_Attention_Neural_Network","342842139_Multi-Level_Fine-Scaled_Sentiment_Sensing_with_Ambivalence_Handling","342837253_Attention-based_sentiment_analysis_using_convolutional_and_recurrent_neural_network","341801569_Emoji-Based_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Attention_Networks","339777957_Multimodal_sentiment_analysis_based_on_multi-head_attention_mechanism","339554508_Larger_Norm_More_Transferable_An_Adaptive_Feature_Norm_Approach_for_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation","339394557_Context-Specific_Heterogeneous_Graph_Convolutional_Network_for_Implicit_Sentiment_Analysis","338945584_Transfer_Learning_with_Dynamic_Adversarial_Adaptation_Network","337763642_BiLSTM_with_Multi-Polarity_Orthogonal_Attention_for_Implicit_Sentiment_Analysis","336996827_Domain-Invariant_Feature_Distillation_for_Cross-Domain_Sentiment_Classification","336996398_Aspect-based_Sentiment_Classification_with_Aspect-specific_Graph_Convolutional_Networks"]}
