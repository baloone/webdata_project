{"id":"319770399_Approximate_nearest_neighbors_towards_removing_the_curse_of_dimensionality","abstract":"The nearest neighbor problem is the following: Given a set of n points P in some metric space X, preprocess P so as to efficiently answer queries which require finding the point in P closest to the query point q in X. We focus on the particularly interesting case of the d-dimensional Euclidean space where X = R-d under some l-p norm.","authors":["Piotr Indyk","Rajeev Motwani"],"meta":["January 1998Chest 126(1):604-613","DOI:10.4086/toc.2012.v008a014"],"references":[]}
