{"id":"341525564_Planning_and_evaluation_during_educational_disruption_lessons_learned_from_COVID-19_pandemic_for_treatment_of_emergencies_in_education","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to formulate a proposal for responding to emergencies in education, either at the level of the education system at a national or regional dimension (macro level) or at the level of an organization (meso level). The impetus of this proposal stemmed from the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in education systems and educational/training organizations worldwide, which has resulted in the disruption of educational function. It should be clarified in advance that this proposal does not concern crises of the education system itself, but situations where a major crisis at another level of public life creates a secondary crisis in education, an emergency in which education cannot fulfill its function.","authors":["Thanassis Karalis"],"meta":["May 2020"],"references":["342475852_THE_IMPACT_OF_COVID-19_ON_LEARNING_-_THE_PERSPECTIVE_OF_THE_GHANAIAN_STUDENT","323397244_In-service_Training_as_a_Factor_in_the_Formation_of_the_Teacher's_Individual_Theory_of_Education","309493304_Cascade_Approach_to_Training_Theoretical_Issues_and_Practical_Applications_in_Non_-Formal_Education","285064922_Effective_Crisis_Management","265240426_Complicated_and_Complex_Systems_What_Would_Successful_Reform_of_Medicare_Look_Like","350685517_Designing_Training_Programs","311528589_Crises_and_Crisis_Management_Integration_Interpretation_and_Research_Development","274583128_Understanding_and_Facilitating_Adult_Learning","274208295_Planning_Responsibly_for_Adult_Education_A_Guide_to_Negotiating_Power_and_Interests","264082730_Development_Evaluation_Applying_Complexity_Concepts_to_Enhance_Innovation_and_Use"]}
