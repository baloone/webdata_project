{"id":"222465334_Scheduling_subject_to_resource_constraints_classification_and_complexity_preprint","abstract":"In deterministic sequencing and scheduling problems, jobs are to be processed on machines of limited capacity. We consider an extension of this class of problems, in which the jobs require the use of additional scarce resources during their execution. A classification scheme for resource constraints is proposed and the computational complexity of the extended problem class is investigated in terms of this classification. Models involving parallel machines, unit-time jobs and the maximum completion time criterion are studied in detail; other models are briefly discussed.","authors":["Jacek Blazewicz","J.K.
