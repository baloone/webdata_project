{"id":"279645666_Are_Secondary_Preservice_Teachers_Well_Prepared_to_Teach_with_Technology_A_Case_Study_of_a_Chinese_Teacher_Education_Program","abstract":"This case study investigates how well secondary preservice teachers are prepared to use technology in teaching in China. The study focuses on a teacher education program that is a representative of many of those in mid-sized Chinese universities. It examines participants' experiences with, perspectives of, and expectations about the use of technology and the training they are receiving in this area. Data collected through survey and interviews indicate that research participants have similar perspectives regarding the use of technology in teaching and the integration of technology in teacher education as their counterparts elsewhere. They reported an overall low level of ability to use technology and shared some concerns with the technology training they received from the teacher education program.","authors":["George Zhou","Zuochen Zhang","Yueke Li","Zhenkun Zhao"],"meta":["June 2010Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 27(6)","DOI:10.14742/ajet.922","Conference: World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and TelecommunicationsVolume: 2010"],"references":["277056241_ICT_in_teacher_education_Examining_needs_expectations_and_attitudes","277054202_Online_professional_development_for_inservice_teachers_in_Information_and_Communication_Technology_Potentials_and_challenges","271503973_Effects_of_an_Educational_Computing_Course_on_Preservice_and_Inservice_Teachers_A_Discussion_and_Analysis_of_Attitudes_and_Use","268056552_Faculty_Adoption_of_Teaching_and_Learning_Technologies_Contrasting_Earlier_Adopters_and_Mainstream_Faculty","266969945_Enhancing_Conceptual_Learning_Through_Computer-Based_Applets_The_Effectiveness_and_Implications","266969508_Adoption_of_educational_technology_ten_years_after_setting_strategic_goals_A_Canadian_university_case","298573718_Examining_teacher_technology_use_Implications_for_preservice_and_Inservice_teacher_preparation_vol_54_pg_297_2003","277254866_Developing_leadership_potential_for_technology_integration_Perspectives_of_three_beginning_teachers","271400388_Educational_Computing_Concerns_of_Postsecondary_Faculty","267971817_Implementing_Web-based_Scientific_Inquiry_in_Preservice_Science_Methods_Courses"]}
