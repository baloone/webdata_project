{"id":"222451426_Scheduling_around_a_small_common_due_date","abstract":"A set of n jobs has to be scheduled on a single machine which can handle only one job at a time. Each job requires a given positive uninterrupted processing time and has a positive weight. The problem is to find a schedule that minimizes the sum of weighted deviations of the job completion times from a given common due date d, which is smaller than the sum of the processing times. We prove that this problem is NP-hard even if all job weights are equal. In addition, we present a pseudopolynomial algorithm that requires O(n2d) time and O(nd) space.","authors":["J.A.
