{"id":"307898201_Singularities_of_plane_rational_curves_via_projections","abstract":"We consider the parameterization ${\\mathbf{f}}=(f_0,f_1,f_2)$ of a plane rational curve $C$ of degree $n$, and we want to study the singularities of $C$ via such parameterization. We do this by using the projection from the rational normal curve $C_n\\subset \\mathbb{P}^n$ to $C$ and its interplay with the secant varieties to $C_n$. In particular, we define via ${\\mathbf{f}}$ certain 0-dimensional schemes $X_k\\subset \\mathbb{P}^k$, $2\\leq k\\leq (n-1)$, which encode all information on the singularities of multiplicity $\\geq k$ of $C$ (e.g. using $X_2$ we can give a criterion to determine whether $C$ is a cuspidal curve or has only ordinary singularities). We give a series of algorithms which allow to get info about the singularities from such schemes.","authors":["Alessandra Bernardi","Alessandro Gimigliano","Monica Id√†"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Symbolic Computation 86","DOI:10.1016/j.jsc.2017.05.003","Project: Effective methods in the study of singularities of rational plane curves"],"references":["290439808_A_Note_on_plane_rational_curves_and_the_associated_Poncelet_Surfaces","266002171_On_rational_cuspidal_curves_I_Sharp_estimate_for_degree_via_multiplicities","287250499_Tensor_decomposition_and_homotopy_continuation","279968621_On_Parameterizations_of_plane_rational_curves_and_their_syzygies","266921016_Lectures_on_curves_surfaces_and_projective_varieties_A_classical_view_of_algebraic_geometry_Transl_from_the_Italian_by_Francis_Sullivan","266521971_Methodes_algebriques_dans_la_theorie_globale_des_espaces_complexes_Vol_1_2_3e_ed_revue_et_augmentee","266219211_Introduction_to_Singularities_and_Deformations","265333153_Numerical_algebraic_geometry","243682383_Ideals_Defined_by_Matrices_and_a_Certain_Complex_Associated_with_Them","233237200_The_restricted_tangent_bundle_of_a_rational_curve_in_P2"]}
