{"id":"290472880_Model_Reduction_by_Nice_Selections_for_Linear_Switched_Systems","abstract":"A moment-matching method for model reduction of linear switched systems (LSSs) is presented. The method can be seen as a non-trivial extension of the Krylov subspace methods for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The procedure is based on the so called 'nice selections,' which represent a choice of basis in the reachability or observability space of the LSS. The framework can also be used for exact matching of the input-output behavior of an LSS with a reduced order LSS for a specific switching sequence. Conditions for applicability of the method for model reduction are stated and finally the results are illustrated on numerical examples.","authors":["Mert Bastug","Mihaly Petreczky","Rafael Wisniewski","John Leth"],"meta":["November 2016IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 61(11):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2016.2518023"],"references":["319434005_Supervisory_Control_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_v20170901","278714004_Supervisory_Control_of_Discrete-Event_Systems","265385601_Model_Reduction_of_Linear_Switched_Systems_by_Restricting_Discrete_Dynamics","260642257_Model_Reduction_by_Moment_Matching_for_Linear_Switched_Systems","257200247_Linear_Multivariable_Control","228962984_Spaces_of_nonlinear_and_hybrid_systems_representable_by_recognizable_formal_power_series","224357879_Balanced_Truncation_for_a_Class_of_Stochastic_Jump_Linear_Systems_and_Model_Reduction_for_Hidden_Markov_Models","224347259_l_2-l_infty_Model_Reduction_for_Switched_LPV_Systems_With_Average_Dwell_Time","224219425_On_the_State-Space_Realization_of_LPV_Input-Output_Models_Practical_Approaches","224166939_Gramian_based_approach_to_model_order-reduction_for_discrete-time_switched_linear_systems","221044462_Hybrid_system_reduction","220665961_Generalised_gramian_framework_for_modelcontroller_order_reduction_of_switched_systems","220544515_Moduli_and_Canonical_Forms_for_Linear_Dynamical_Systems_II_The_Topological_Case","42801427_Realization_theory_for_linear_and_bilinear_switched_systems_A_formal_power_series_approach_Part_II_Bilinear_switched_systems","324336156_Matrix_Computations","321610844_Automata_Logics_and_Infinite_Games_A_Guide_to_Current_Research","316629329_Supervisory_Control_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_updated_20170501","265374983_Switched_Linear_Systems_Control_and_Design","260710565_A_Simultaneous_Balanced_Truncation_Approach_to_Model_Reduction_of_Switched_Linear_Systems","260525539_A_Posteriori_Error_Bounds_for_Krylov-Based_Fast_Frequency_Sweeps_of_Finite-Element_Systems","248675924_Verification_and_Control_of_Hybrid_Systems_A_Symbolic_Approach","247278103_Projection_methods_for_model_reduction_of_large-scale_dynamical_systems","243786519_Approximation_of_Large-Scale_Dynamical_Systems","235358281_Balanced_truncation_for_linear_switched_systems","233587262_m-Dependent_model_reduction_for_uncertain_discrete-time_switched_linear_systems_with_average_dwell_time","233222124_Model_order-reduction_for_discrete-time_switched_linear_systems","228939269_Reduction_of_Affine_Systems_on_Polytopes","226089723_A_model-order_reduction_method_based_on_Krylov_subspaces_for_mimo_bilinear_dynamical_systems","224157068_Balanced_Truncation_for_Discrete_Time_Markov_Jump_Linear_Systems","224126875_Model_Reduction_by_Moment_Matching_for_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Systems","223912845_An_iterative_SVD-Krylov_based_method_for_model_reduction_of_large-scale_dynamical_systems","223875922_Model_simplification_for_switched_hybrid_systems","223743660_Games_for_synthesis_of_controllers_with_partial_observation","223215791_H_Model_reduction_for_uncertain_switched_linear_discrete-time_systems","222430802_A_projection_method_for_model_reduction_of_bilinear_dynamical_system","221996515_System_Identification_Theory_For_The_User","221658449_Switching_in_System_and_Control","220398730_Model_Reduction_for_Discrete-Time_Switched_Linear_Time-Delay_Systems_via_the_H_Robust_Stability","215721501_Matrix_Computations","47524279_Partial-realization_theory_for_linear_switched_systems_-A_formal_power_series_approach","3224384_Error_bound_for_reduced_system_model_by_Pade_approximation_via_the_Lanczos_process","2538646_Krylov_Projection_Methods_For_Model_Reduction"]}
