{"id":"314092617_Learning_with_Errors_is_easy_with_quantum_samples","abstract":"Learning with Errors is one of the fundamental problems in computational learning theory and has in the last years become the cornerstone of post-quantum cryptography. In this work, we study the quantum sample complexity of Learning with Errors and show that there exists an efficient quantum learning algorithm (with polynomial sample and time complexity) for the Learning with Errors problem where the error distribution is the one used in cryptography. While our quantum learning algorithm does not break the LWE-based encryption schemes proposed in the cryptography literature, it does have some interesting implications for cryptography: first, when building an LWE-based scheme, one needs to be careful about the access to the public-key generation algorithm that is given to the adversary; second, our algorithm shows a possible way for attacking LWE-based encryption by using classical samples to approximate the quantum sample state, since then using our quantum learning algorithm would solve LWE.","authors":["Alex Grilo","Iordanis Kerenidis"],"meta":["February 2017","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032314"],"references":["287686793_Demonstration_of_quantum_advantage_in_machine_learning","325246763_Efficient_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Standard_LWE","317572179_Guest_Column_A_Survey_of_Quantum_Learning_Theory","314819406_Adiabatic_quantum_state_generation_and_statistical_zero_knowledge","312759829_A_Survey_of_Quantum_Learning_Theory","305472584_Breaking_Symmetric_Cryptosystems_Using_Quantum_Period_Finding","304788415_Optimal_Quantum_Sample_Complexity_of_Learning_Algorithms","301871365_Noise-Tolerant_Learning_the_Parity_Problem_and_the_Statistical_Query_Model","299417700_A_Decade_of_Lattice_Cryptography","267434436_Secure_Signatures_and_Chosen_Ciphertext_Security_in_a_Quantum_Computing_World"]}
