{"id":"309769344_An_Application_of_the_Geometric_Method_to_Assembly_Sequence_Planning","abstract":"With the continuous development of technology, the automation assembly phase of manufacturing industry has been gradually realized. Computer aided assembly is an important technical basis in this process, and the assembly sequence planning is one of the core technologies. In recent years, most of the research on assembly sequence planning is based on expert systems or the soft computing methods. In this paper, a new geometric method, the orientation matrix, is introduced in the process of calculating the assembly sequence planning. The direction matrix is used to record the relationship between the support and interference of different parts in different assembly directions, which can effectively reduce the difficulty of solving the problem. Then, the influence of assembly direction is analyzed, and the assembly sequence planning algorithm based on direction matrix is proposed. The time complexity of assembly sequence planning is greatly reduced.","authors":["Y.
