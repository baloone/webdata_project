{"id":"324634327_Revised_simplex_algorithm_for_linear_programming_on_GPUs_with_CUDA","abstract":"The revised simplex algorithm (RSA) is a typical algorithm for solving linear programming problems. Many theoretical modifications have been done to make the algorithm more efficient, but almost all of them were based on single-instruction single-data architecture processors (CPUs), which could not make full use of the inherent parallel characteristics of RSAs. We propose a novel single-instruction multiple-data architecture processor (GPU) based on the RSA in this paper. The intensive matrix manipulations of a traditional RSA are offloaded to the GPU, which helps to make full use of its powerful parallel processing ability. We implemented the GPU-based RSA on compute unified device architecture (CUDA). Numerical experiments on randomly generated linear programs show that the GPU-based RSA can not only find the correct optimal solutions, but can also reach a speed of up to 100 times as fast as that of a CPU-based RSA: it also runs 3 to 11 times as fast as MATLAB.","authors":["Lili He","Hongtao Bai","Yu Jiang","Dantong Ouyang"],"meta":["November 2018Multimedia Tools and Applications 77(10):1-16","DOI:10.1007/s11042-018-5947-z"],"references":["295039041_On_Solving_Ill-Conditioned_Linear_Systems","290454072_A_mixed_integer_linear_programming_model_to_optimize_reverse_logistics_activities_of_end-of-life_vehicles_in_Turkey","303746126_Hierarchical_Density-Based_Clustering_based_on_GPU_Accelerated_Data_Indexing_Strategy","302590897_Multi-GPU_Acceleration_of_Algebraic_Multigrid_Preconditioners","300347850_GPU-Based_Computing_for_Nesting_Problems_The_Importance_of_Sequences_in_Static_Selection_Approaches","286490513_Enabling_Personalized_Search_over_Encrypted_Outsourced_Data_with_Efficiency_Improvement","278302929_Linear_Programming_Models_based_on_Omega_Ratio_for_the_Enhanced_Index_Tracking_Problem","276368901_A_Secure_and_Dynamic_Multi-Keyword_Ranked_Search_Scheme_over_Encrypted_Cloud_Data","275974311_GPU-accelerated_micromagnetic_simulations_using_cloud_computing","274736904_On_the_performance_of_multi-GPU-based_expert_systems_for_acoustic_localization_involving_massive_microphone_arrays","265381590_Novel_update_techniques_for_the_revised_simplex_method","242022445_A_new_algorithm_to_solve_fully_fuzzy_linear_programming_problems_using_the_MOLP_problem","273191656_Achieving_Efficient_Cloud_Search_Services_Multi-Keyword_Ranked_Search_over_Encrypted_Cloud_Data_Supporting_Parallel_Computing","234830238_Cuda_by_Example_An_Introduction_to_General-Purpose_GPU_Programming","234056614_A_new_efficient_primal_dual_simplex_algorithm"]}
