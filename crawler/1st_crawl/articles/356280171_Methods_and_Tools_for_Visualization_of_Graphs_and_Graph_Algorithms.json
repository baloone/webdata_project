{"id":"356280171_Methods_and_Tools_for_Visualization_of_Graphs_and_Graph_Algorithms","abstract":"Graphs are the most common abstract structure encountered in computer science and are widely used for structural information visualization. In the paper, we consider practical and general graph formalism of so called hierarchical graphs and present the Higres and ALVIS systems aimed at supporting of structural information visualization on the base of hierarchical graph models.","authors":["Victor Kasyanov"],"meta":["November 2021","DOI:10.46300/91014.2021.15.13"],"references":["346675450_Graph_Theory_for_Programmers","277298498_Graph_Layout_for_the_VCG_Tool","266285331_Hierarchical_graphs_and_graph_models_Problems_of_visual_processing","246628719_Demonstration_of_the_interactive_Graph_Visualization_SystemdaVinci","245250247_Algorithm_Animation-Chap-ter_Introduction","240866746_Planarity_for_Clustered_Graphs","225111012_The_graphlet_system_system_demonstration","221025457_Algorithm_Animation_-_Introduction","220422660_On_Visual_Formalisms","216633399_A_Heuristic_for_Graph_Drawing","30508458_Portable_Graph_Layout_and_Editing","30508466_Demonstration_of_the_Interactive_Graph_Visualization_System_da_Vinci","3410886_Graph_Visualization_and_Navigation_in_Information_Visualization_A_Survey","3113924_Visualization_of_Structural_Information_Automatic_Drawing_of_Compound_Digraphs","2821926_Graph_Layout_through_the_VCG_Tool"]}
