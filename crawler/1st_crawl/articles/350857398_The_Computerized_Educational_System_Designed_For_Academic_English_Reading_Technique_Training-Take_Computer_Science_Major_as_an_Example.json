{"id":"350857398_The_Computerized_Educational_System_Designed_For_Academic_English_Reading_Technique_Training-Take_Computer_Science_Major_as_an_Example","abstract":"As we all know that computer science is the future in every scientific research field. So, the students who are going to graduate from University or to get higher degree all need to study the advanced techs through articles written in English. Especially for the graduates who major in computer science, for their research, the first step is to understand the English materials. However, English reading seems to be a big problem for them. In this article, the author tentatively proves the idea— common reader, especially computer science major readers can improve reading ability by practicing their eyeball. The author uses this method to help the computer science major students to get the success as quickly as possible, so that they can get the capacity in future research. The author used the computer and a software that a picture moves all the time from left to right. By this way, the author want to train the students’ eyeball ability. And then he fastened the speed little by little and help the students to master the scientific rule of the eyeball movement practicing. The author held a three-step-experiment. Each step includes methods and tests. After each step, according to the result of the test, the author improved the method.","authors":["Biao Li","Jing Liu","Jianxun Guo","Chen Zhou"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1852(3):032062","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1852/3/032062"],"references":["276945383_The_Psychology_and_Pedagogy_of_Reading","274817106_Increasing_Educational_Achievement_Via_Self_Concept_Change","232475485_Fundamental_reading_habits_a_study_of_their_development","47602833_The_study_of_eye_movements_in_reading"]}
