{"id":"332769985_Facets_of_quantum_information_under_non-Markovian_evolution","abstract":"We consider two non-Markovian models: random telegraph noise and non-Markovian dephasing. The memory in these models is studied from the perspective of quantum Fisher information flow. This is found to be consistent with the other well-known witnesses of non-Markovianity. The two noise channels are characterized quantum information theoretically by studying their gate and channel fidelities. Further, the quantum coherence and its balance with mixedness is studied. This helps to put in perspective the role that the two noise channels can play in various facets of quantum information processing and quantum communication.","authors":["Javid Naikoo","Supriyo Dutta","Subhashish Banerjee"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.99.042128"],"references":["330763074_Study_of_coherence_and_mixedness_in_meson_and_neutrino_systems","326759579_Evolution_of_coherence_and_non-classicality_under_global_environmental_interaction","320975872_Non-Markovian_Evolution_A_Quantum_Walk_Perspective","306376606_Quantum_cryptography_over_non-Markovian_channels","301846346_Characterization_of_Unruh_Channel_in_the_context_of_Open_Quantum_Systems","284579330_Dynamics_of_non-Markovian_open_quantum_systems","283531293_Trace_distance_measure_of_coherence","280589781_Assisted_Distillation_of_Quantum_Coherence","274012617_Maximally_coherent_mixed_states_Complementarity_between_maximal_coherence_and_mixedness","271071934_Characterization_of_quantum_dynamics_using_quantum_error_correction","264127012_Non-Markovianity_and_reservoir_memory_of_quantum_channels_A_quantum_information_theory_perspective","260267593_Canonical_form_of_master_equations_and_characterization_of_non-Markovianity","258224333_Quantifying_Coherence","258164957_Dissipative_and_Non-dissipative_Single-Qubit_Channels_Dynamics_and_Geometry","253239405_Quantum_Fisher_information_of_entangled_coherent_states_in_the_presence_of_photon_loss","249012028_Vibrations_Quanta_and_Biology","235489433_Comparing_different_non-Markovianity_measures_in_a_driven_qubit_system","235470561_Depolarizing_channel_as_a_completely_positive_map_with_memory","235389140_Quantum_Metrology_in_Non-Markovian_Environments","233923372_Quantum_biology","221965834_Optimal_control_for_non-Markovian_open_quantum_systems","51934807_Quantifying_non-Markovianity_of_continuous_variable_Gaussian_dynamicalmaps","47637928_Continuous_variable_quantum_key_distribution_in_non-Markovian_channels","45887918_Quantum_Fisher_Information_Flow_in_Non-Markovian_Processes_of_Open_Systems","43021081_Measure_for_the_Degree_of_Non-Markovian_Behavior_of_Quantum_Processes_in_Open_Systems","23464086_Assessing_Non-Markovian_Quantum_Dynamics","1896716_Squeezed_generalized_amplitude_damping_channel","345064439_Open_Quantum_Systems_Dynamics_of_Nonclassical_Evolution","327901104_Non-Markovian_dephasing_and_depolarizing_channels","322076449_Concepts_of_quantum_non-Markovianity_A_hierarchy","281396694_Quantum_Fisher_information_of_a_qubit_initially_correlated_with_a_non-Markovian_environment","279309918_Operational_Resource_Theory_of_Coherence","276464892_Optimized_probing_states_for_qubit_phase_estimation_with_general_quantum_noise","275974287_Non-Markovian_dynamics_in_open_quantum_systems","260545995_States_Effects_and_Operations_Fundamental_Notions_of_Quantum_Theory","258695285_Quantifying_non-Markovianity_via_correlations","258310450_Dynamics_of_decoherence_without_dissipation_in_a_squeezed_thermal_bath","222645423_A_simple_formula_for_the_average_gate_fidelity_of_a_quantum_dynamical_operation","216025514_Quantum_theory_of_a_Stern-Gerlach_system_in_contact_with_a_linearly_dissipative_environment","46424436_Entanglement_and_Non-Markovianity_of_Quantum_Evolutions","10726281_General_quantum_Brownian_motion_with_initially_correlated_and_nonlinearly_coupled_environment","1749186_Enhanced_quantum_entanglement_in_the_non-Markovian_dynamics_of_biomolecular_excitons"]}
