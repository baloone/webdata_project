{"id":"329715294_Toward_an_Integrated_Process_Model_for_Smart_Contract_Engineering","abstract":"Engineering smart contracts for trustless, append-only, and decentralized digital ledgers allows mutually distrustful parties to transform legal requirements into immutable and formalized rules. We present an integrated process model for engineering blockchain-based smart contracts, which explicitly accounts for the immutability of the trustless, append-only, and decentralized digital ledger ecosystem and overcomes several limitations of traditional software engineering process models. Applying such a model when engineering smart contracts will help software engineers and developers to streamline and better understand the overall engineering process of decentralized digital ledgers in general and the blockchain in particular.","authors":["Christian Sillaber","Bernhard Waltl","Horst Treiblmaier","Ulrich Gallersd√∂rfer"],"meta":["December 2018","Conference: Pre-ICIS SIGBPS 2018 Workshop on Blockchain and Smart ContractAt: San Francisco, USA","Project: Implications of Blockchain"],"references":["318902771_Life_Cycle_of_Smart_Contracts_in_Blockchain_Ecosystems","235616507_Toward_Agile_An_Integrated_Analysis_of_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Field_Data_on_Software_Development_Agility","222484351_Design_and_Natural_Science_Research_on_Information_Technology","315856245_A_Survey_of_Attacks_on_Ethereum_Smart_Contracts_SoK"]}
