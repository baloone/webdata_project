{"id":"3160351_On_the_distribution_of_the_peak-to-average_power_ratio_in_OFDM_Signals","abstract":"The distribution of the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in\nstrictly band-limited orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)\nsignals is studied. Assuming that the base-band OFDM signal is\ncharacterized as a band-limited complex Gaussian process, we first\nattempt to derive the exact distribution of the PAPR in the band-limited\nOFDM signals. Since this distribution cannot be expressed in a closed\nform, we further develop a simple closed-form approximation, based on\nthe level-crossing rate analysis. Comparisons of the proposed\ndistributions with those obtained by computer simulations show good\nagreement and convergence with an increase in the number of subcarriers","authors":["Hideki Ochiai","Hideki Imai"],"meta":["March 2001IEEE Transactions on Communications 49(2):282 - 289","DOI:10.1109/26.905885","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["302374300_Mathematical_Analysis_of_Random_Noise","279090725_Zero_Crossings_Peaks_and_Other_Statistical_Measures_of_Random_Responses","266351996_Stochastic_Processes_and_Random_Vibrations_Theory_and_Practice","261626865_Probability_Random_Variables_and_Stochastic_Processes","245034097_A_Random_Variables_and_Stochastic_Process","243774537_Properties_of_Sine_Wave_Plus_Random_Noise","243495890_Zero_Crossings_Peaks_and_Other_Statistical_Measures_of_Random_Responses","243495028_On_the_Fatigue_Failure_of_Structures_due_to_Vibrations_Excited_by_Random_Pressure_Fields","241586721_The_Statistical_Distribution_of_the_Maxima_of_a_Random_Function","239064444_Block_coding_scheme_based_on_complementary_sequences_for_multi-carrier_signals"]}
