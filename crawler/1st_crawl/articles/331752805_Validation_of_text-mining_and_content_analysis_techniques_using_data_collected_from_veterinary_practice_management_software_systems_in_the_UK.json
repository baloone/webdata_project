{"id":"331752805_Validation_of_text-mining_and_content_analysis_techniques_using_data_collected_from_veterinary_practice_management_software_systems_in_the_UK","abstract":"Electronic patient records from practice management software systems have been used extensively in medicine for the investigation of clinical problems leading to the creation of decision support frameworks. To date, technologies that have been utilised for this purpose such as text mining and content analysis have not been employed significantly in veterinary medicine.\nThe aim of this research was to pilot the use of content analysis and text-mining software for the synthesis and analysis of information extracted from veterinary electronic patient records. The purpose of the work was to be able to validate this approach for future employment across a number of practices for the purposes of practice based research. The approach utilised content analysis (Prosuite) and text mining (WordStat) software to aggregate the extracted text. Text mining tools such as Keyword in Context (KWIC) and Keyword Retrieval (KR) were employed to identify specific occurrences of data across the records. Two different datasets were interrogated, a bespoke test dataset that had been set up specifically for the purpose of the research, and a functioning veterinary clinic dataset that had been extracted from one veterinary practice.\nAcross both datasets, the KWIC analysis was found to have a high level of accuracy with the search resulting in a sensitivity of between 85.3–100%, a specificity of between 99.1–99.7%, a positive predictive value between 93.5–95.8% and a negative predictive value between 97.7–100%. The KR search, based on machine learning, was utilised for the clinic-based dataset and was found to perform slightly better than the KWIC analysis.\nThis study is the first to demonstrate the application of content analysis and text mining software for validation purposes across a number of different datasets for the purpose of search and recall of specific information across electronic patient records. This has not been demonstrated previously for small animal veterinary epidemiological research for the purposes of large scale analysis for practice-based research. Extension of this work to investigate more complex diseases across larger populations is required to fully explore the use of this approach in veterinary practice.","authors":["Julie Jones-Diette","Rachel S.
