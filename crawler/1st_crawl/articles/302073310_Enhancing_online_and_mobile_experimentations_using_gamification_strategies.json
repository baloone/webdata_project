{"id":"302073310_Enhancing_online_and_mobile_experimentations_using_gamification_strategies","abstract":"In teaching theoretical topics, modern STEM education uses interactive hands-on approaches, which support students in understanding the topic instead of teaching them simply how to memorize theoretical concepts. Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles.","authors":["Johanna Pirker","Christian Guetl","Yacob Astatke"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/EXPAT.2015.7463270","Conference: 2015 3rd Experiment International Conference (exp.at'15)"],"references":["344542618_Electric_Circuits_Online_Towards_a_Completely_Online_Electrical_Engineering_Curriculum","309050128_Engaging_Engineering_Students_with_Gamification","303018696_Gamification_Toward_a_definition","265425905_An_Innovative_Approach_for_Implementing_an_Online_Undergraduate_Electrical_Engineering_Program_for_Community_College_Students","265425294_Digital_Games_in_Education_The_Design_of_Game-Based_Learning_Environments","261674921_Motivational_Active_Learning_-_Engaging_University_Students_in_Computer_Science_Education","256743509_Does_Gamification_Work_-_A_Literature_Review_of_Empirical_Studies_on_Gamification","235744034_SPECIAL_FOCUS_PAPER_A_REMOTE_AND_VIRTUAL_LAB_WITH_EXPERIMENTS_FOR_SECONDARY_EDUCATION_ENGINEERING_AND_LIFELONG_LEARNING_COURSES_A_Remote_and_Virtual_Lab_with_Experiments_for_Secondary_Education_Engine","233896258_Theories_and_principles_of_motivation","228884866_MDA_A_Formal_Approach_to_Game_Design_and_Game_Research","228710512_Interactive-Engagement_Versus_Traditional_Methods_A_Six-Thousand-Student_Survey_of_Mechanics_Test_Data_for_Introductory_Physics_Courses","227601946_E-learning_Emerging_uses_empirical_results_and_future_directions","201381833_Games_Motivation_and_Learning_A_Research_and_Practice_Model","4054535_Remote_laboratories_versus_virtual_and_real_laboratories","273947281_The_gamification_of_learning_and_instruction_Game-based_methods_and_strategies_for_training_and_education_San_Francisco_CA_Pfeiffer","273946893_For_the_Win_How_Game_Thinking_can_Revolutionize_your_Business","268809290_Educational_Gamified_Science_Simulations","265877898_Raising_engagement_in_e-learning_through_gamification","263268381_On_the_potential_for_using_immersive_virtual_environments_to_support_laboratory_experiment_contextualisation","259532895_The_Art_of_Game_Design_A_book_of_lenses","256847568_Remote_electronics_lab_within_a_MOOC_Design_and_preliminary_results","237748408_STEM_STEM_education_STEMmania","234791913_Learning_and_motivational_impacts_of_a_multimedia_science_game","224369642_A_Remote_Laboratory_in_Engineering_Measurement","220694443_Gamification_by_Design_Implementing_Game_Mechanics_in_Web_and_Mobile_Apps"]}
