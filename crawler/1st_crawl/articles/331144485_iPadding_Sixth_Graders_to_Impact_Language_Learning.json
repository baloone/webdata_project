It has a wide high-resolutiontouch screen, which enhances input as well as learners’ attention,making them focus on key language features and raising theirawareness. Furthermore, the iPad is compatible with the most recentapplications for the development of interactive skills.The author investigated the impact of iPad on a class of sixth gradersin their first year of learning Italian and compared their learning to anon-iPadded class over two years’ time, first in sixth grade and then inseventh grade. Results show that, thanks to mobile technology, theiPadded sixth graders generally progressed better than the noniPaddedsixth graders, but, remarkably, even better than the noniPaddedseventh graders in oral interactive tasks.","authors":["Sonia Rocca"],"meta":["October 2015IALLT Journal of Language Learning Technologies 45(1):23-43","DOI:10.17161/iallt.v45i1.8548"],"references":[]}
