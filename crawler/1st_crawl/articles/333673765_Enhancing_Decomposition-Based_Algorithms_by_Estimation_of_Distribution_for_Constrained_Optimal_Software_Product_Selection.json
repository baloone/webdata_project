{"id":"333673765_Enhancing_Decomposition-Based_Algorithms_by_Estimation_of_Distribution_for_Constrained_Optimal_Software_Product_Selection","abstract":"This paper integrates an estimation of distribution\nbased update operator into decomposition-based multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithms for binary optimization. The probabilistic\nmodel in the update operator is a probability vector, which is\nadaptively learnt from historical information of each subproblem.\nWe show that this update operator can significantly enhance\ndecomposition-based algorithms on a number of benchmark\nproblems. Moreover, we apply the enhanced algorithms to the\nconstrained optimal software product selection problem in the\nfield of search-based software engineering. For this real-world\nproblem, we give its formal definition and then develop a new\nrepair operator based on satisfiability solvers. It is demonstrated\nby the experimental results that the algorithms equipped with\nthe estimation of distribution operator are effective in dealing\nwith this practical problem, particularly for large-scale instances.\nThe interdisciplinary studies in this paper provide a new realworld\napplication scenario for constrained multi-objective binary\noptimizers, and also offer valuable techniques for software\nengineers in handling the optimal software product selection\nproblem.","authors":["Xiang Yi","Yang Xiaowei","Zhou Yuren","Huang Han"],"meta":["June 2019IEEE transactions on neural
