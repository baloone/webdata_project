{"id":"322410495_Is_Scientific_Collaboration_Sustainability_Predictable","abstract":"This work aims to explore whether the sustainability of scientific collaboration including collaboration duration and collaboration times can be predicted. For this purpose, we propose a series of features including structural similarity indices, authorship properties, and research interests. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our proposed model outperforms baseline model by 10% in MAE. Our study may shed light on investigating scientific collaboration from the perspective of sustainability.","authors":["Wei Wang","Zixin Cui","Tong Gao","Shuo Yu"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.1145/3041021.3054230","Conference: the 26th International Conference"],"references":["308409137_A_Bayesian_Perspective_on_Early_Stage_Event_Prediction_in_Longitudinal_Data","301266911_Tracing_and_Predicting_Collaboration_for_Junior_Scholars","258305843_Statistical_Mechanics_and_its_Applications_-_Link_prediction_in_complex_networks_A_survey","47326911_Link_Prediction_in_Complex_Networks_A_Survey"]}
