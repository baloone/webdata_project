{"id":"220685724_Association_Schemes_and_Coding_Theory","abstract":"This paper contains a survey of association scheme theory (with\nits algebraic and analytical aspects) and of its applications to coding\ntheory (in a wide sense). It is mainly concerned with a class of\nsubjects that involve the central notion of the distance distribution of\na code. Special emphasis is put on the linear programming method,\ninspired by the MacWilliams transform. This produces upper bounds for\nthe size of a code with a given minimum distance, and lower bounds for\nthe size of a design with a given strength. The most specific results\nare obtained in the case where the underlying association scheme\nsatisfies certain well-defined “polynomial properties;” this\nleads one into the realm of orthogonal polynomial theory. In particular,\nsome “universal bounds” are derived for codes and designs in\npolynomial type association schemes. Throughout the paper, the main\nconcepts, methods, and results are illustrated by two examples that are\nof major significance in classical coding theory, namely, the Hamming\nscheme and the Johnson scheme. Other topics that receive special\nattention are spherical codes and designs, and additive codes in\ntranslation schemes, including Z<sub>4</sub>-additive binary codes","authors":["Philippe Delsarte","Vladimir I.
