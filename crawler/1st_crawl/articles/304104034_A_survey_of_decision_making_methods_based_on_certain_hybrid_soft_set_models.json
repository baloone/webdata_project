{"id":"304104034_A_survey_of_decision_making_methods_based_on_certain_hybrid_soft_set_models","abstract":"Fuzzy set theory, rough set theory and soft set theory are all generic mathematical tools for dealing with uncertainties. There has been some progress concerning practical applications of these theories, especially, the use of these theories in decision making problems. In the present article, we review some decision making methods based on (fuzzy) soft sets, rough soft sets and soft rough sets. In particular, we provide several novel algorithms in decision making problems by combining these kinds of hybrid models. It may be served as a foundation for developing more complicated soft set models in decision making.","authors":["Xueling Ma","Qi Liu","Jianming Zhan"],"meta":["April 2017Artificial Intelligence Review 47:507-530","DOI:10.1007/s10462-016-9490-x"],"references":["293646347_Another_approach_to_rough_soft_hemirings_and_corresponding_decision_making","344877194_Fuzzy_decision_support_system_for_fertilizer","320007561_Soft_bckbci-algebras","320006844_Soft_sets_and_soft_rough_sets","320006710_Applications_of_soft_sets_in_ideal_theory_of_BCKBCI-algebras","303056279_Fuzzy_soft_sets","286792446_Applications_of_a_new_soft_set_to_h-hemiregular_hemirings_via_MN-SI-h-ideals","284001909_Constructive_methods_of_rough_approximation_operators_and_multigranulation_rough_sets","282887368_A_novel_fuzzy_decision-making_system_for_CPU_scheduling_algorithm","282376877_Applications_of_soft_intersection_set_theory_to_h-hemiregular_and_h-semisimple_hemirings","282053533_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_parameterized_soft_set_theory_and_its_decision_making","277913461_An_Application_of_Multicriteria_Group_Decision_Making_by_Soft_Covering_Based_Rough_Sets","277580229_A_new_soft_union_set_characterizations_of_hemirings","279321980_Fuzzy_Soft_Lie_Algebras","277712671_Uncertain_Linguistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Their_Applications_in_Group_Decision_Making"]}
