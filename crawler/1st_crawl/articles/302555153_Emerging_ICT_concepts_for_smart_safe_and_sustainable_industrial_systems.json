{"id":"302555153_Emerging_ICT_concepts_for_smart_safe_and_sustainable_industrial_systems","abstract":"This editorial introduces the special issue on Emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) concepts for smart, safe and sustainable industrial systems in the Elsevier journal Computers in Industry. The 13 papers in this special issue were selected because of their high quality and also because they propose emerging ICT solutions that address at least one of the three dimensions we suggest as basic requirements to design usable future Industrial Systems that must be safe, smart and sustainable. Previous global discussions about the state of the art with regard to the topic of this special issue are provided, as well as exploratory guidelines for future research in this area.","authors":["Damien Trentesaux","Theodor Borangiu","Andr√© Thomas"],"meta":["May 2016Computers in Industry 81","DOI:10.1016/j.compind.2016.05.001","Projects: contributions to the physical
