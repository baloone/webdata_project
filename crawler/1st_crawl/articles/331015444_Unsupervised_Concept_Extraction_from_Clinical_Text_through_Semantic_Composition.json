{"id":"331015444_Unsupervised_Concept_Extraction_from_Clinical_Text_through_Semantic_Composition","abstract":"Concept extraction is an important step in clinical natural language processing. Once extracted, the use of concepts can improve the accuracy and generalization of downstream systems. We present a new unsupervised system for the extraction of concepts from clinical text. The system creates representations of concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS®) by combining natural language descriptions of concepts with word representations, and composing these into higher-order concept vectors. These concept vectors are then used to assign labels to candidate phrases which are extracted using a syntactic chunker. Our approach scores an exact F-score of.32 and an inexact F-score of.45 on the well-known I2b2-2010 challenge corpus, outperforming the only other unsupervised concept extraction method. As our approach relies only on word representations and a chunker, it is completely unsupervised. As such, it can be applied to languages and corpora for which we do not have prior annotations. All our code is open-source and can be found at www.github.com/clips/conch.","authors":["Stéphan Tulkens","Simon Šuster","Walter Daelemans"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Biomedical Informatics 91:103120","DOI:10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103120"],"references":["323664116_Deep_learning_with_word_embeddings_improves_biomedical_named_entity_recognition","315695828_A_Short_Review_of_Ethical_Challenges_in_Clinical_Natural_Language_Processing","304746330_Normalizing_acronyms_and_abbreviations_to_aid_patient_understanding_of_clinical_texts_ShAReCLEF_eHealth_Challenge_2013_Task_2","303499206_MIMIC-III_a_freely_accessible_critical_care_database","276356916_Building_the_graph_of_medicine_from_millions_of_clinical_narratives","260972224_Medical_Entity_Recognition_A_Comparison_of_Semantic_and_Statistical_Methods","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","255975021_Unsupervised_Biomedical_Named_Entity_Recognition_Experiments_with_Clinical_and_Biological_Texts","228452494_Dynamic_Pooling_and_Unfolding_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Paraphrase_Detection","51230615_2010_i2B2VA_challenge_on_concepts_assertions_and_relations_in_clinical_text","51120629_Machine-learned_solutions_for_three_stages_of_clinical_information_extraction_The_state_of_the_art_at_i2b2_2010","46158275_Mayo_Clinical_Text_Analysis_and_Knowledge_Extraction_System_cTAKES_Architecture_component_evaluation_and_applications","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","334116358_The_Lifted_Matrix-Space_Model_for_Semantic_Composition","323885950_The_Unified_Medical_Language_System","321771408_Vector_representations_of_multi-word_terms_for_semantic_relatedness","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","318029292_Recurrent_neural_networks_with_specialized_word_embeddings_for_health-domain_named-entity_recognition","317067168_A_Study_of_Concept_Extraction_Across_Different_Types_of_Clinical_Notes","307456359_Learning_Low-Dimensional_Representations_of_Medical_Concepts","286964721_Deep_recursive_neural_networks_for_compositionality_in_language","262366950_Accurate_unsupervised_joint_named-entity_extraction_from_unaligned_parallel_text","262352255_A_comparison_of_vector-based_representations_for_semantic_composition","243786282_Serial_order_A_parallel_distributed_processing_approach","222471818_On_the_compositional_and_noncompositional_nature_of_idiomatic_expressions","222449846_Finding_Structure_in_Time","222429471_Unsupervised_named-entity_extraction_from_the_Web_An_experimental_study","220817634_Structured_Generative_Models_for_Unsupervised_Named-Entity_Clustering","215992076_Vector-based_Models_of_Semantic_Composition","2481707_Unsupervised_Models_for_Named_Entity_Classification"]}
