{"id":"354385689_Limited-angle_computed_tomography_with_deep_image_and_physics_priors","abstract":"Computed tomography is a well-established x-ray imaging technique to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of objects. It has been used extensively in a variety of fields, from diagnostic imaging to materials and biological sciences. One major challenge in some applications, such as in electron or x-ray tomography systems, is that the projections cannot be gathered over all the angles due to the sample holder setup or shape of the sample. This results in an ill-posed problem called the limited angle reconstruction problem. Typical image reconstruction in this setup leads to distortion and artifacts, thereby hindering a quantitative evaluation of the results. To address this challenge, we use a generative model to effectively constrain the solution of a physics-based approach. Our approach is self-training that can iteratively learn the nonlinear mapping from partial projections to the scanned object. Because our approach combines the data likelihood and image prior terms into a single deep network, it is computationally tractable and improves performance through an end-to-end training. We also complement our approach with total-variation regularization to handle high-frequency noise in reconstructions and implement a solver based on alternating direction method of multipliers. We present numerical results for various degrees of missing angle range and noise levels, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","authors":["Semih Barutcu","Selin Aslan","Aggelos Katsaggelos","Doğa Gürsoy"],"meta":["September 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-97226-2"],"references":["342793544_Computed_Tomography_Reconstruction_Using_Deep_Image_Prior_and_Learned_Reconstruction_Methods","339372808_Tomographic_reconstruction_with_a_generative_adversarial_network","338515790_Multi-GPU_Multi-Node_Algorithms_for_Acceleration_of_Image_Reconstruction_in_3D_Electrical_Capacitance_Tomography_in_Heterogeneous_Distributed_System","338237535_Coconut_shell_derived_biochar_to_enhance_water_spinach_Ipomoea_aquatica_Forsk_growth_and_decrease_nitrogen_loss_under_tropical_conditions","337109802_MemXCT_memory-centric_X-ray_CT_reconstruction_with_massive_parallelization","335624676_A_joint_deep_learning_model_to_recover_information_and_reduce_artifacts_in_missing-wedge_sinograms_for_electron_tomography_and_beyond","335099826_Photon_limited_ptychography_of_3D_objects_via_Bayesian_reconstruction","333228756_End-to-end_lung_cancer_screening_with_three-dimensional_deep_learning_on_low-dose_chest_computed_tomography","340165058_Diffraction_tomography_with_a_deep_image_prior","335538195_Sinogram_Image_Completion_for_Limited_Angle_Tomography_With_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","327520077_Deep_Learning-Based_Sinogram_Completion_for_Low-Dose_CT","321375076_Deep_Image_Prior","321347561_Lose_The_Views_Limited_Angle_CT_Reconstruction_via_Implicit_Sinogram_Completion","332519400_ADMM-based_deep_reconstruction_for_limited-angle_CT","322380081_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Inverse_Problems_in_Imaging_Beyond_Analytical_Methods"]}
