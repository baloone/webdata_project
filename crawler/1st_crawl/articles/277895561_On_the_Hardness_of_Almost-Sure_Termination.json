{"id":"277895561_On_the_Hardness_of_Almost-Sure_Termination","abstract":"This paper considers the computational hardness of computing expected\noutcomes and deciding (universal) (positive) almost-sure termination of\nprobabilistic programs. It is shown that computing lower and upper bounds of\nexpected outcomes is $\\Sigma_1^0$- and $\\Sigma_2^0$-complete, respectively.\nDeciding (universal) almost-sure termination as well as deciding whether the\nexpected outcome of a program equals a given rational value is shown to be\n$\\Pi^0_2$-complete. Finally, it is shown that deciding (universal) positive\nalmost-sure termination is $\\Sigma_2^0$-complete ($\\Pi_3^0$-complete).","authors":["Benjamin Lucien Kaminski","Joost-Pieter Katoen"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-48057-1_24","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer ScienceVolume: 9234"],"references":["336339226_Proof_rules_for_probabilistic_loops","228526924_Probabilistic_Termination_of_CHRiSM_Programs","304628693_Operational_versus_weakest_pre-expectation_semantics_for_the_probabilistic_guarded_command_language","287097474_Recursive_predicates_and_quantifiers","282925483_Probabilistic_termination_Soundness_completeness_and_compositionality","259510432_Operational_Versus_Weakest_Precondition_Semantics_for_the_Probabilistic_Guarded_Command_Language","256554795_Probabilistic_termination_versus_fair_termination","239067016_Classical_recursion_theory_Vols","238772026_Recursively_Enumerable_Sets_of_Positive_Integers_and_Their_Decision_Problems","237129616_Classical_recursion_theory-The_theory_of_functions_and_sets_of_natural_numbers"]}
