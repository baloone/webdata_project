{"id":"319477781_Experimental_Comparisons_Between_Implicit_and_Explicit_Implementations_of_Discrete-Time_Sliding_Mode_Controllers_Toward_Input_and_Output_Chattering_Suppression","abstract":"This brief presents a set of experimental results concerning the sliding mode control of an electropneumatic system. Two discrete-time control strategies are considered: an explicit and an implicit (that is very easy to implement with a projection on the interval [-1,1]) Euler discretizations. While the explicit implementation is known to generate numerical chattering, the implicit one is expected to significantly reduce chattering while keeping the accuracy. The experimental results reported in this brief remarkably confirm that the implicit discrete-time sliding mode supersedes the explicit ones, with several important features: chattering in the control input is almost eliminated (while the explicit and saturated controllers behave like high-frequency bang-bang inputs), the input magnitude depends only on the perturbation size and is independent of the controller gain and sampling time.","authors":["Bin Wang","Bernard Brogliato","Vincent Acary","Ahsene Boubakir"],"meta":["September 2015Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on 23(5):2071-2075","DOI:10.1109/TCST.2015.2396473"],"references":["256660724_A_novel_adaptive-gain_supertwisting_sliding_mode_controller_Methodology_and_application","245321688_Nonlinear_Discrete_Variable_Structure_Systems_in_Quasi-Sliding_Mmode","50875357_Chattering-Free_Digital_Sliding-Mode_Control_With_State_Observer_and_Disturbance_Rejection","316866817_Higher_Order_Sliding_Mode_Observer-Based_Control","280675904_Comparisons_between_implicit_and_explicit_discrete-time_implementations_of_equivalent-control-based_sliding_mode_controllers_input_and_output_chattering_suppression_via_the_implicit_method","272742331_Discrete-time_twisting_controller_without_numerical_chattering_analysis_and_experimental_results_with_an_implicit_method","263130986_Sliding_Mode_Control_in_Electro-Mechanical_Systems","245322398_Higher_order_sliding_mode_control_based_on_optimal_approach_of_an_electropneumatic_actuator","230873496_Sliding_Mode_in_Control_Optimization","224401732_High-Order_Sliding-Mode_Controllers_of_an_Electropneumatic_Actuator_Application_to_an_Aeronautic_Benchmark","224358201_Analysis_of_Zero-Order_Holder_Discretization_of_Two-Dimensional_Sliding-Mode_Control_Systems","223333921_Implicit_Euler_numerical_scheme_and_chattering-free_implementation_of_sliding_mode_systems","222798779_ZOH_discretization_effect_on_single-input_sliding_mode_control_systems_with_matched_uncertainties","3452399_Complex_Discretization_Behaviors_of_a_Simple_Sliding-Mode_Control_System","3217413_Discrete-time_quasi-sliding-mode_control_strategies"]}
