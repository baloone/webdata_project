{"id":"341836597_Attribute-Guided_Feature_Learning_Network_for_Vehicle_Reidentification","abstract":"Vehicle re-identification (reID) targets at matching same vehicle images captured from multi-cameras, which has become a hot topic in recent years. However, it poses the critical but challenging problem that is caused by complicated environments and diversified illuminations. Inspired by the benefit of attributes that contain detailed descriptions, this paper proposes a novel Attribute-Guided Network (AGNet), which learns global representation with the abundant attribute features in an end-to-end manner. Specially, an attribute-guided module is proposed in AGNet to generate the attribute mask which inversely guide to select discriminative features for category classification. Moreover, in AGNet, an attribute-based label smoothing loss is presented to better train the reID model, which can strength the distinct ability of reID model and regularize AGNet model according to the attributes. The experiment result validate the effectiveness of AGNet and demonstrate AGNet achieves excellent performance on two benchmark datasets.","authors":["Huibing Wang","Jinjia Peng","Dongyan Chen","Guangqi Jiang"],"meta":["June 2020IEEE Multimedia PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MMUL.2020.2999464"],"references":["319236861_PROVID_Progressive_and_Multimodal_Vehicle_Reidentification_for_Large-Scale_Urban_Surveillance","308872089_A_Large-Scale_Car_Dataset_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization_and_Verification","308278517_A_Deep_Learning-Based_Approach_to_Progressive_Vehicle_Re-identification_for_Urban_Surveillance","301817268_Learning_Deep_Feature_Representations_with_Domain_Guided_Dropout_for_Person_Re-identification","281861606_Unsupervised_Metric_Fusion_Over_Multiview_Data_by_Graph_Random_Walk-Based_Cross-View_Diffusion","332815662_Cross-View_GAN_Based_Vehicle_Generation_for_Re-identification","332452232_Two-Level_Attention_Network_With_Multi-Grain_Ranking_Loss_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","331205891_Structural_Analysis_of_Attributes_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification_and_Retrieval","331158735_Embedding_Adversarial_Learning_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","330812907_3-D_PersonVLAD_Learning_Deep_Global_Representations_for_Video-Based_Person_Reidentification","329750650_Viewpoint-Aware_Attentive_Multi-view_Inference_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","324024736_Vehicle_Re-Identification_by_Deep_Hidden_Multi-View_Inference","322650282_Group_Sensitive_Triplet_Embedding_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","322059845_Learning_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Vehicle_Re-ID_with_Visual-spatio-Temporal_Path_Proposals","322058472_Orientation_Invariant_Feature_Embedding_and_Spatial_Temporal_Regularization_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","311611186_Deep_Relative_Distance_Learning_Tell_the_Difference_between_Similar_Vehicles","296373109_Person_re-identification_by_Local_Maximal_Occurrence_representation_and_metric_learning","233824159_Clustering_via_geometric_median_shift_over_Riemannian_manifolds"]}
