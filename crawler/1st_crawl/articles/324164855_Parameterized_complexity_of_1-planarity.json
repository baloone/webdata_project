{"id":"324164855_Parameterized_complexity_of_1-planarity","abstract":"We consider the problem of drawing graphs with at most one crossing per edge. These drawings, and the graphs that can be drawn in this way, are called 1-planar. Finding 1-planar drawings is known to be NP-hard, but we prove that it is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the vertex cover number, tree-depth, and cyclomatic number. Special cases of these algorithms provide polynomial-time recognition algorithms for 1-planar split graphs and 1-planar cographs. However, recognizing 1-planar graphs remains NP-complete for graphs of bounded bandwidth, pathwidth, or treewidth.","authors":["M.J. Bannister","S. Cabello","D.
