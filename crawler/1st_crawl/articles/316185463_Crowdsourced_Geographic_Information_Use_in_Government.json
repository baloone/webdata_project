{"id":"316185463_Crowdsourced_Geographic_Information_Use_in_Government","abstract":"This report is based on a six-month study of the use of volunteered geographic information (VGI) by government. It focuses on government use of information relating to a location, which was produced through what is known as “crowdsourcing”, the process of obtaining information from many contributors amongst the general public, regardless of their background and skill level. The aim of this report is to provide a guide for the successful implementation of VGI in government.","authors":["Muki Haklay","Vyron Antoniou","S Basiouka","Robert Soden"],"meta":["June 2014"],"references":["265895366_Detecting_Level-of-Detail_Inconsistencies_in_Volunteered_Geographic_Information_Data_Sets","258730470_Towns_Conquer_A_Gamified_application_to_collect_geographical_names","295293541_Disaster_waiting_to_happen","292254686_CORINE_land_cover_project","285775770_Geographic_information_systems_and_science_3e","274824933_Putting_Nairobi's_Slums_on_the_Map","274164819_Geographic_information_systems_A_management_perspective","265921739_COMMUNITY_MAPPING_AND_GOVERMENT_MAPPING_POTENTIAL_COLLABORATION","259556537_A_Comprehensive_Framework_for_Intrinsic_OpenStreetMap_Quality_Analysis","237237988_Did_You_Feel_It_Intensity_Data_A_Surprisingly_Good_Measure_of_Earthquake_Ground_Motion"]}
