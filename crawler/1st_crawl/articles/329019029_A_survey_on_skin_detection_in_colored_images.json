{"id":"329019029_A_survey_on_skin_detection_in_colored_images","abstract":"Color is an efficient feature for object detection as it has the advantage of being invariant to changes in scaling, rotation, and partial occlusion. Skin color detection is an essential required step in various applications related to computer vision. The rapidly-growing research in human skin detection is based on the premise that information about individuals, intent, mode, and image contents can be extracted from colored images, and computers can then respond in an appropriate manner. Detecting human skin in complex images has proven to be a challenging problem because skin color can vary dramatically in its appearance due to many factors such as illumination, race, aging, imaging conditions, and complex background. However, many methods have been developed to deal with skin detection problem in color images. The purpose of this study is to provide an up-to-date survey on skin color modeling and detection methods. We also discuss relevant issues such as color spaces, cost and risks, databases, testing, and benchmarking. After investigating these methods and identifying their strengths and limitations, we conclude with several implications for future direction.","authors":["Sinan Naji","Hamid A Jalab","Sameem Abdul Kareem"],"meta":["August 2019Artificial Intelligence Review 52(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10462-018-9664-9"],"references":["318912899_Human_Face_Detection_Using_Skin_Color_Segmentation_and_Watershed_Algorithm","318035506_Multi-Task_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Patient_Detection_and_Skin_Segmentation_in_Continuous_Non-Contact_Vital_Sign_Monitoring","313234507_A_Multi-Scale_Approach_to_Skin_Pixel_Detection","312510669_Combining_Convolutional_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Human_Skin_Detection","311808210_Face_Detection_Based_on_Skin_Color_Segmentation_Using_Fuzzy_Entropy","325915021_Human_skin_detection_using_histogram_processing_and_Gaussian_Mixture_Model_based_on_color_spaces","323352404_Convolutional_neural_networks_and_training_strategies_for_skin_detection","312594530_High_Performance_Novel_Skin_Segmentation_Algorithm_for_Images_With_Complex_Background","311551085_Video_pornography_detection_through_deep_learning_techniques_and_motion_information","311469814_Multiple_color_space_channel_fusion_for_skin_detection","311357856_Human_skin_detection_through_correlation_rules_between_the_YCb_and_YCr_subspaces_based_on_dynamic_color_clustering","310049723_Improved_Human_Skin_Segmentation_Using_Fuzzy_Fusion_Based_on_Optimized_Thresholds_by_Genetic_Algorithms","309769756_Pixel-based_skin_detection_based_on_statistical_models","308500227_Human_computer_interface_using_hand_gesture_recognition_based_on_neural_network","308498977_Human_computer_interface_using_hand_gesture_recognition_based_on_neural_network"]}
