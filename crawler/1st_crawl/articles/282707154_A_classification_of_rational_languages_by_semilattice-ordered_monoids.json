{"id":"282707154_A_classification_of_rational_languages_by_semilattice-ordered_monoids","abstract":"We prove here an Eilenberg type theorem: the so-called conjunctive varieties of rational languages correspond to the pseudovarieties of finite semilattice-ordered monoids. Taking complements of members of a conjunctive variety of languages we get a so-called disjunctive variety. We present here a non-trivial example of such a variety together with an equational characterization of the corresponding pseudovariety.","authors":["Libor Polak"],"meta":["January 2004Archivum Mathematicum 40(4):395-406"],"references":["220980192_On_Logical_Descriptions_of_Regular_Languages","220975988_Syntactic_Semiring_of_a_Language","285522503_Operators_on_classes_of_regular_languages"]}
