{"id":"335642134_Nonblocking_Supervisory_Control_of_State-Tree_Structures_With_Conditional-Preemption_Matrices","abstract":"State-tree structures (STS) is a powerful tool for the modeling and control of large-scale discrete-event systems (DES) whose structure is organized in a top-down hierarchy. The notorious state-explosion problem can be managed effectively in the framework of STS. Priority is an important concept and exists in a wide range of DES, such as manufacturing systems, traffic systems, and logistic (service) systems. In this work, a conditional preemption matrix is used to describe the preemption relations among events, which can represent the priority intuitively. In order to augment STS with priority, we propose a novel STS framework: state-tree structures with conditional-preemption matrices (STSM), which aims to solve different kinds of issues related to priority. The optimal nonblocking supervisory control is deployed in the framework of STSM. Symbolic synthesis algorithms are implemented and integrated in a software tool, STSLib, which exploits binary decision diagrams (BDD) as a basis for efficient computation. The developed approach is demonstrated by (a) manufacturing systems using automatic guided vehicles and (b) real-time systems.","authors":["Deguang Wang","Xi Wang","Zhiwu Li"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TII.2019.2939628"],"references":["270742096_Priority-Driven_Swapping-Based_Scheduling_of_Aperiodic_Real-Time_Messages_Over_EtherCAT_Networks","262689747_Holistic_Scheduling_of_Real-Time_Applications_in_Time-Triggered_In-Vehicle_Networks","251396842_Supervisory_control_of_discrete_event_processes","228690561_Supervisor_Localization_A_Top-Down_Approach_to_Distributed_Control_of_Discrete-Event_Systems","5600688_On_the_complexity_of_supervisory_control_design_in_the_RW_framework","4364929_STSLib_and_its_application_to_two_benchmarks","3032446_Nonblocking_Supervisory_Control_of_State_Tree_Structures","329980837_Synthesis_of_Supervisory_Control_With_Partial_Observation_on_Normal_State-Tree_Structures","327993119_Supervisory_control_of_state-tree_structures_with_partial_observation","324376260_Supervisory_control_of_discrete-event_systems_A_brief_history","318291677_Real-time_supervisory_control_of_a_processor_for_non-preemptive_execution_of_periodic_tasks","314714796_Real-Time_Big_Data_Delivery_in_Wireless_Networks_A_Case_Study_on_Video_Delivery","305760822_Preference-Oriented_Fixed-Priority_Scheduling_for_Periodic_Real-Time_Tasks","305714395_Exploiting_Symmetry_of_State_Tree_Structures_for_Discrete-event_Systems_with_Parallel_Components","301319534_A_Review_of_Priority_Assignment_in_Real-Time_Systems","299188319_Supervisory_control_of_a_class_of_concurrent_discrete_event_systems","298902816_Optimal_Priority-Free_Conditionally-Preemptive_Real-Time_Scheduling_of_Periodic_Tasks_Based_on_DES_Supervisory_Control","297608940_Compact_Supervisory_Control_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_by_Petri_Nets_With_Data_Inhibitor_Arcs","292346078_Scheduling_of_Single-Arm_Cluster_Tools_for_an_Atomic_Layer_Deposition_Process_With_Residency_Time_Constraints","288179573_Pareto-Optimization_for_Scheduling_of_Crude_Oil_Operations_in_Refinery_via_Genetic_Algorithm","283754296_Dynamic_Multiple-Period_Reconfiguration_of_Real-Time_Scheduling_Based_on_Timed_DES_Supervisory_Control","280765005_Graph-based_algorithms_for_Boolean_function_manipulation","262726678_Statecharts_A_Visual_Formalism_For_Complex_Systems","239787864_Modular_supervisory_control_and_coordination_of_state_tree_structures","220197979_On_the_Analysis_of_Petri_Nets_with_Static_Priorities","3022924_On_deadlock-free_modular_supervisory_control_of_discrete-event_systems"]}
