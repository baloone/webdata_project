{"id":"266496608_Using_JMeter_to_Performance_Test_Web_Services","abstract":"Performance testing is an important part of any distributed or Web application testing plan. Inclusion of performance estimates into planning and development cycles ensures that the application delivered to a customer satisfies high load, availability and scalability requirements. Early identification of software load limitations helps to configure the system appropriately to avoid unexpected crashes. Several questions should be addressed at system performance analysis: will the system or server be able to process simultaneous requests coming from hundreds, or thousands of clients, and, what is the frequency of requests the system can handle. This type of test not only provides an absolute measure of system response time, but also targets the regressions on server and application code, examines if the response from the server matches the expected result, and helps to evaluate and compare middleware solutions from different vendors. Apache JMeterâ€”a performance testing framework from Apache, has been widely accepted as a performance testing tool for Web applications. It can be used to analyze overall server performance under simulated heavy load. The software features FTP and HTTP requests and extensible custom scripting features. In this article we show how JMeter can be used to load test Web services. In particular we demonstrate it by deploying a simple Web service on BEA WebLogic Server 9.0. The example test plan illustrates the creation of a test plan, thread group, loop, and a Web service request. We also discuss how to measure the data and interpret results displayed on graphical tools provided with JMeter chart.","authors":["Dmitri Nevedrov"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
