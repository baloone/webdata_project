{"id":"261710868_Academic_integrity_Differences_between_computing_assessments_and_essays","abstract":"There appears to be a reasonably common understanding about\nplagiarism and collusion in essays and other assessment items\nwritten in prose text. However, most assessment items in\ncomputing are not based in prose. There are computer programs,\ndatabases, spreadsheets, and web designs, to name but a few. It\nis far from clear that the same sort of consensus about plagiarism\nand collusion applies when dealing with such assessment items;\nand indeed it is not clear that computing academics have the\nsame core beliefs about originality of authorship as apply in the\nworld of prose. We have conducted focus groups at three\nAustralian universities to investigate what academics and\nstudents in computing think constitute breaches of academic\nintegrity in non-text-based assessment items; how they regard\nsuch breaches; and how academics discourage such breaches,\ndetect them, and deal with those that are found. We find a\ngeneral belief that non-text-based computing assessments differ\nin this regard from text-based assessments, that the boundaries\nbetween acceptable and unacceptable practice are harder to\ndefine than they are for text assessments, and that there is a case\nfor applying different standards to these two different types of\nassessment. We conclude by discussing what we can learn from\nthese findings.","authors":["Christopher W.
