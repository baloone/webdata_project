{"id":"332080457_Green_Computing_in_Sensors-Enabled_Internet_of_Things_Neuro_Fuzzy_Logic-Based_Load_Balancing","abstract":"Energy is a precious resource in the sensors-enabled Internet of Things (IoT). Unequal load on sensors deplete their energy quickly, which may interrupt the operations in the network. Further, a single artificial intelligence technique is not enough to solve the problem of load balancing and minimize energy consumption, because of the integration of ubiquitous smart-sensors-enabled IoT. In this paper, we present an adaptive neuro fuzzy clustering algorithm (ANFCA) to balance the load evenly among sensors. We synthesized fuzzy logic and a neural network to counterbalance the selection of the optimal number of cluster heads and even distribution of load among the sensors. We developed fuzzy rules, sets, and membership functions of an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system to decide whether a sensor can play the role of a cluster head based on the parameters of residual energy, node distance to the base station, and node density. The proposed ANFCA outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of node death rate percentage, number of remaining functioning nodes, average energy consumption, and standard deviation of residual energy.","authors":["Pankaj Kashyap","Sushil Kumar","Upasana Dohare","Vinod Kumar"],"meta":["March 2019Electronics 8(4):384","DOI:10.3390/electronics8040384"],"references":["324653339_Enabling_Green_Computing_in_Cloud_Environments_Network_Virtualization_Approach_Towards_5G_Support","322636515_Fuzzy-Based_Channel_Selection_for_Location_Oriented_Services_in_Multichannel_VCPS_Environments","321638300_Cross-Layer_Energy_Optimization_for_IoT_Environments_Technical_Advances_and_Opportunities","320255725_Towards_Green_Computing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Controlled_Mobility_aided_Balanced_Tree_Approach","320228150_Towards_Video_Streaming_in_IoT_Environments_Vehicular_Communication_Perspective","317545248_Analytical_Model_of_Deployment_Methods_for_Application_of_Sensors_in_Non-hostile_Environment","317379718_Virtualization_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Fault_Tolerant_Embedding_for_Internet_of_Things","322140788_Towards_Green_Computing_for_Internet_of_Things_Energy_Oriented_Path_and_Message_Scheduling_Approach","321690558_Vehicular_Multi-access_Edge_Computing_with_licensed_Sub-6_GHz_IEEE_80211p_and_mmWave","319279992_Fuzzy_Comprehensive_Evaluation_Method_for_Energy_Management_Systems_Based_on_an_Internet_of_Things"]}
