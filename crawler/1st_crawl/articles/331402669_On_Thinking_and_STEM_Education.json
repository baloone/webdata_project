{"id":"331402669_On_Thinking_and_STEM_Education","abstract":"The rapidly evolving and global field of STEM education has placed ever-increasing calls for interdisciplinary research and the development of new and deeper scholarship in and for STEM education. In this editorial, we focus on the topic of thinking, first with a brief overview of related studies and conceptions in the past. We then problematize a traditional conception of thinking in the context of STEM education, and propose possible alternative perspectives about thinking areas for future research.","authors":["Yeping Li","Alan H Schoenfeld","Andrea A.
