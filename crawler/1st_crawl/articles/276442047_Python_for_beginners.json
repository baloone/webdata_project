{"id":"276442047_Python_for_beginners","abstract":"Python, an open source scripting language, has become the most popular introductory teaching language at top U.S. universities, especially Georgia Tech University. Because it is a scripting language, Python automates tasks that would otherwise need to be performed manually. Python programs also tend to be shorter than equivalent programs written in Java because of its built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing. John Guttag, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, believes more colleges are using Python as an introductory programming language is that it has a very large set of highly useful libraries that have been built over the years that support things that are easy to use from language proper. Shriram Krishnamurthi, a professor of computer science at Brown University, agrees Python has made people feel more comfortable about exposing programming to a much broader audience of students. Krishnamurthi says Python may be fashionable right now, but he believes it lacks staying power.","authors":["Esther Shein"],"meta":["February 2015Communications of the ACM 58(3):19-21","DOI:10.1145/2716560"],"references":["262171514_Exploring_hypotheses_about_media_comptation","215900246_Python_CS1_as_preparation_for_C_CS2","264945378_Introduction_to_computation_and_programming_using_Python_Revised_and_expanded_edition","262294706_Online_python_tutor_Embeddable_web-based_program_visualization_for_cs_education","233871341_CS_Circles_An_In-Browser_Python_Course_for_Beginners"]}
