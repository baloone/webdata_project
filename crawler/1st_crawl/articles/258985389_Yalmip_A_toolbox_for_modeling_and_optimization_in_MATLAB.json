{"id":"258985389_Yalmip_A_toolbox_for_modeling_and_optimization_in_MATLAB","abstract":"The use of MATLAB toolbox YALMIP to model and solve optimization problems occuring in systems in control theory was discussed. The toolbox makes development of control oriented SDP problems. Rapid prototyping of an algorithm based on SDP can be done using standard MATLAB commands. YALMIP automatically detects the kind of a problem the user has defined, and selects a suitable solver based on this analysis.","authors":["Johan LÃ¶fberg"],"meta":["January 2004","Conference: Proceedings of the CACSD Conference"],"references":["2616595_Global_Optimization_With_Polynomials_And_The_Problem_Of_Moments","224170307_Lean_backstepping_design_for_a_jet_engine_compressor_model"]}
