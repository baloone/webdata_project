{"id":"282181451_An_Entropy_Stable_Nodal_Discontinuous_Galerkin_Method_for_the_Two_Dimensional_Shallow_Water_Equations_on_Unstructured_Curvilinear_Meshes_with_Discontinuous_Bathymetry","abstract":"We design an arbitrary high order accurate nodal discontinuous Galerkin\nspectral element approximation for the nonlinear two dimensional shallow water\nequations with non-constant, possibly discontinuous, bathymetry on\nunstructured, possibly curved, quadrilateral meshes. The scheme is derived from\na skew-symmetric formulation of the continuous problem. We prove that this\ndiscretisation exactly preserves the local mass and momentum. Furthermore,\ncombined with a special numerical interface flux function, the method exactly\npreserves the entropy, which is also the total energy for the shallow water\nequations. This entropy conserving scheme is the baseline for a provably\nentropy stable scheme. Finally, with a particular discretisation of the\nbathymetry source term we prove that the numerical approximation is\nwell-balanced. The proofs and derivations use skew-symmetric reformulations of\nthe problem to remove aliasing errors. However, as many additional terms are\nintroduced, the resulting skew-symmetric scheme is not computationally\ntractable. Therefore, we provide an equivalent reformulation of the\nskew-symmetric scheme, which restores computational efficiency. We provide\nnumerical examples that verify the theoretical findings and furthermore provide\nan application of the scheme for a partial break of a curved dam test problem.","authors":["Niklas Wintermeyer","Andrew R.
