{"id":"312007234_Reflective_Learning_and_the_Growth_of_Intellect_and_Identity","abstract":"Reflection in learning is crucial as it provides learners with the chance to think about what they do, clarify what they understand by their actions, and adapt ways of working towards achieving goals. The continuous doing and posing inquiries about personal experiences is key to learners' intellectual growth and understanding of professional identity. This chapter outlines how content and professional knowledge of student-teachers in a Malaysian university progress through engagement in research process, and how involvement in research shapes their teacher personality and qualities as they become more critical and open-minded during the learning process. The study shows that reflection can promote self-regulation of learning habits that enhance growth of intellect and professional identity. The findings have implications on the provision of teacher education in higher education. It is imperative that teaching and learning activities help learners to recognise, understand, appreciate and reflect on their personal, social and professional development.","authors":["Jamiah Baba","Nabilah Abdullah"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.4018/978-1-5225-1689-7.ch003","In book: Student-Driven Learning Strategies for the 21st Century Classroom"],"references":["277687099_Constructing_Professional_Identity_The_Role_of_Work_and_Identity_Learning_Cycles_in_the_Customization_of_Identity_Among_Medical_Students","226905103_Academics'_experiences_of_understanding_of_their_subject_matter_and_the_relationship_of_this_to_their_experiences_of_teaching_and_learning","225989076_Relations_Between_Teachers'_Approaches_to_Teaching_and_Students'_Approaches_to_Learning","220017462_Enhancing_Teaching_Through_Constructive_Alignment","44830072_The_reflective_institution_Assuring_and_enhancing_the_quality_of_teaching_and_learning","43508414_Debating_Organization_Point-Counterpoint_in_Organization_Studies","343320505_Understanding_Adult_Learners","324343052_Modernity_and_Self-Identity_Self_and_Society_in_the_Late_Modern_Age","312453886_Reflecting_on_reflective_practice","312341372_Cognitive_apprenticeship_Making_thinking_visible","304436599_Cognitive_apprenticeship_Making_thinking_visible","292773220_Enacting_an_environment_The_infrastructure_of_organizing","289327533_Reconstructing_the_Lifelong_Learner_Pedagogy_and_Identity_in_Individual_Organisational_and_Social_Change","285463699_OpennessIntellect_A_dimension_of_personality_reflecting_cognitive_exploration","280696722_Recovering_Informal_Learning_Wisdom_Judgement_and_Community","273234820_Theory_in_Practice_Increasing_Professional_Effectiveness","250251819_Triangulation_Establishing_the_Validity_of_Qualitative_Studies1","249634302_Transforming_Selves","249005143_The_Formation_of_Identity_The_importance_of_ideals","240703348_The_Role_of_Cognitive_Development_in_Mezirow's_Transformational_Learning_Theory","232462685_Knowledge_Creation_and_Knowledge_Use_in_Professional_Contexts","227636484_Transformative_Learning_Theory","226584219_Nature_And_Development_of_Generic_Attributes","225315785_Congruence_between_intention_and_strategy_in_university_science_teachers'_approaches_to_teaching","222006068_University_teachers'_experiences_of_academic_leadership_and_their_approaches_to_teaching","215439083_The_Reflective_Practitioner_How_Professionals_Think_In_Action","201381775_Experience_And_Education","44820920_Developing_Professional_Knowledge_and_Competence","28147808_Organizational_Learning_A_Theory_of_Action_Perspective"]}
