A geodesic graph, , is a graph with vertex set S and edge set E such that each edge is the shortest geodesic path between a and b inside P. is said to be plane if the edges in E do not cross. If the points in S are colored, then is said to be properly colored provided that, for each edge , a and b have different colors. In this paper we consider the problem of computing (properly colored) plane geodesic perfect matchings, Hamiltonian cycles, and spanning trees of maximum degree three.","authors":["Ahmad Biniaz","Prosenjit Bose","Anil Maheshwari","Michiel Smid"],"meta":["May 2016Computational Geometry 57","DOI:10.1016/j.comgeo.2016.05.004"],"references":["45072322_Edge-Removal_and_Non-Crossing_Configurations_in_Geometric_Graphs","303187543_Computing_a_Geodesic_Two-Center_of_Points_in_a_Simple_Polygon","300636388_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Plane_Matchings_in_Multipartite_Geometric_Graphs","257428785_Relative_Convex_Hulls_in_Semi-Dynamic_Arrangements","247699059_Computing_Geodesic_Properties_Inside_a_Simple_Polygon","228600739_Discrete_Geometry_on_Red_and_Blue_Points_in_the_Plane_-_A_Survey_-","225791910_The_furthest-site_geodesic_Voronoi_diagram","221557261_Bipartite_Embeddings_of_Trees_in_the_Plane","220983194_The_geodesic_farthest-site_Voronoi_diagram_in_a_polygonal_domain_with_holes","220618273_Optimal_Search_in_Planar_Subdivisions","220569305_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220223671_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_Visibility_and_Shortest_Path_Problems_Inside_Triangulated_Simple_Polygons","34558743_Maximum_matchings_in_complete_multipartite_graphs","2907862_Geodesic_Ham-Sandwich_Cuts"]}
