One-hundred and thirty-nine trainee teachers participated in thestudy. They comprised 12.2% male students and 87.8% female. They majored in agricultural science, home-science, language, economics or accounting and science and mathematics. Their academic achievements were between 2.00 and 3.74 (Mean = 2.91, SD = 0.41). More than 50% of them felt ready to integrate computer in teaching. In general, UPM trainee teachers had positive attitudes towards the integration of computer in teaching. They had a moderately high computer efficacy. There are significant relationships between attitudes towards the integration of computers in teaching and their perceptions about their abilities to work on: data base graphics, electronic spreadsheet and word processing.","authors":["Shamsiah Mohamed","Abrahim Bakar"],"meta":["January 2008Journal of Social Sciences 4(1)","DOI:10.3844/jssp.2008.62.67"],"references":["304534356_Handling_nonresponse_issues","282979801_Teachers_instructional_material_utilization_competencies_in_secondary_schools_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa_professional_and_non-professional_teachers'_perspective","240273265_Teacher_education_Preparing_teachers_to_integrate_technology","233099454_Information_Technology_and_Teacher_Education_Dissertations_1989-91","229759696_IT_in_education_and_teacher_education_in_Australia","44831071_Information_and_communication_technologies_in_teacher_education_a_planning_guide"]}
