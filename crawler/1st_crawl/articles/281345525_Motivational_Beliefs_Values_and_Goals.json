{"id":"281345525_Motivational_Beliefs_Values_and_Goals","abstract":"This chapter reviews the recent research on motivation, beliefs, values, and goals, focusing on developmental and educational psychology. The authors divide the chapter into four major sections: theories focused on expectancies for success (self-efficacy theory and control theory), theories focused on task value (theories focused on intrinsic motivation, self-determination, flow, interest, and goals), theories that integrate expectancies and values (attribution theory, the expectancy-value models of Eccles et al., Feather, and Heckhausen, and self-worth theory), and theories integrating motivation and cognition (social cognitive theories of self-regulation and motivation, the work by Winne & Marx, Borkowski et al., Pintrich et al., and theories of motivation and volition). The authors end the chapter with a discussion of how to integrate theories of self-regulation and expectancy-value models of motivation and suggest new directions for future research.","authors":["Jacquelynne S Eccles","Allan Wigfield"],"meta":["February 2002Annual Review of Psychology 53(1):109-132","DOI:10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135153"],"references":["283159673_Motivation_in_the_Classroom_Reciprocal_Effects_of_Teacher_Behavior_and_Student_Engagement_Across_the_School_Year","311175320_Self-regulated_learning_Finding_a_balance_between_learning_goals_and_ego-protective_goals","294689395_On_schooling_and_mental_health_Introduction_to_the_special_issue","289963001_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Motivations_Classic_Definition_and_New_Directions","282204033_Classroom_Learning_and_Motivation_Clarifying_and_Expanding_Goal_Theory","281230773_Relations_of_Social_Goal_Pursuit_to_Social_Acceptance_Classroom_Behavior_and_Perceived_Social_Support","280758090_Motivational_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_Components_of_Classroom_Academic_Performance","280751547_Attaining_self-regulation_A_social_cognitive_perspective","279980202_Does_Being_Good_Make_the_Grade_Social_Behavior_and_Academic_Competence_in_Middle_School","279004105_Goals_An_Approach_to_Motivation_and_Achievement"]}
