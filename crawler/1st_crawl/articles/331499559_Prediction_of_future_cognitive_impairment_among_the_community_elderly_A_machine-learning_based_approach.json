{"id":"331499559_Prediction_of_future_cognitive_impairment_among_the_community_elderly_A_machine-learning_based_approach","abstract":"The early detection of cognitive impairment is a key issue among the elderly. Although neuroimaging, genetic, and cerebrospinal measurements show promising results, high costs and invasiveness hinder their widespread use. Predicting cognitive impairment using easy-to-collect variables by non-invasive methods for community-dwelling elderly is useful prior to conducting such a comprehensive evaluation. This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based predictive model for future cognitive impairment. A total of 3424 community elderly without cognitive impairment were included from the nationwide dataset. The gradient boosting machine (GBM) was exploited to predict cognitive impairment after 2 years. The GBM performance was good (sensitivity = 0.967; specificity = 0.825; and AUC = 0.921). This study demonstrated that a machine learning-based predictive model might be used to screen future cognitive impairment using variables, which are commonly collected in community health care institutions. With efforts of enhancing the predictive performance, such a machine learning-based approach can further contribute to the improvement of the cognitive function in community elderly.","authors":["Kyoung-Sae Na"],"meta":["March 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-39478-7"],"references":["326975091_Machine_learning_of_neuroimaging_for_assisted_diagnosis_of_cognitive_impairment_and_dementia_A_systematic_review","324174667_Association_of_Lower_Spiritual_Well-Being_Social_Support_Self-Esteem_Subjective_Well-Being_Optimism_and_Hope_Scores_With_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment_and_Mild_Dementia","317663801_Reducing_social_isolation_and_loneliness_in_older_people_A_systematic_review_protocol","309218342_Gender-Specific_Incidence_and_Predictors_of_Cognitive_Impairment_among_Older_Koreans_Findings_from_a_6-Year_Prospective_Cohort_Study","308702857_Which_type_of_social_activities_may_reduce_cognitive_decline_in_the_elderly_A_longitudinal_population-based_study","323531438_The_association_between_depression_and_mild_cognitive_impairment_A_cross-sectional_study","323314270_Contribution_of_alcohol_use_disorders_to_the_burden_of_dementia_in_France_2008-13_A_nationwide_retrospective_cohort_study","318396923_Mild_cognitive_impairment_in_type_2_diabetes_mellitus_and_related_risk_factors_A_review","318373718_Strategic_roadmap_for_an_early_diagnosis_of_Alzheimer's_disease_based_on_biomarkers","309455572_The_financial_burden_and_health_care_utilization_patterns_associated_with_amnestic_mild_cognitive_impairment"]}
