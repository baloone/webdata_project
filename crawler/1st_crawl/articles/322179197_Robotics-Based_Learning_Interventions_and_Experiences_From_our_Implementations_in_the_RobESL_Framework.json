The RoboESL project aims to exploiting the potential of robotics for developing extra-curricular constructivist learning activities in schools that will help children at risk of failure or Early School Leaving (ESL) practice and develop their creativity skills, raise self-esteem, motivate their interest in schooling, and finally encourage them towards staying at school. During the implementation, students worked in a constructionist learning environment and were engaged in team activities. The author runs the project for two consecutive school years using EV3 Lego Mindstorms and participated in dissemination events organizing workshops where the students participated in the program taught elementary school pupils.","authors":["Tassos Karampinis"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Smart Education and Urban Society 9(1):13-24","DOI:10.4018/IJSEUS.2018010102"],"references":["284043695_Educational_robotics_Open_questions_and_new_challenges","272493981_Embodied_Cognition_and_its_applications_A_brief_review","241624003_Sowing_the_Seeds_for_a_more_Creative_Society","220042061_Implications_Of_Postmodernism_For_Science_Or_Science_As_Progressive_Discourse","318419122_In_and_out_of_the_School_Activities_Implementing_IBSE_and_Constructionist_Learning_Methodologies_by_Means_of_Robotics","284740700_Democracy_in_education","215439773_Seven_Goals_for_the_Design_of_Constructivist_Learning_Environments","49551001_Democracy_And_Education","49548367_How_we_Think"]}
