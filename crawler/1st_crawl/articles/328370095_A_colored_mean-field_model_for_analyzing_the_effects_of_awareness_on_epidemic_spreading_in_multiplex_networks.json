{"id":"328370095_A_colored_mean-field_model_for_analyzing_the_effects_of_awareness_on_epidemic_spreading_in_multiplex_networks","abstract":"We study the impact of susceptible nodes’ awareness on epidemic spreading in social systems, where the systems are modeled as multiplex networks coupled with an information layer and a contact layer. We develop a colored heterogeneous mean-field model taking into account the portion of the overlapping neighbors in the two layers. With theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we derive the epidemic threshold which determines whether the epidemic can prevail in the population and find that the impacts of awareness on threshold value only depend on epidemic information being available in network nodes’ overlapping neighborhood. When there is no link overlap between the two network layers, the awareness cannot help one to raise the epidemic threshold. Such an observation is different from that in a single-layer network, where the existence of awareness almost always helps.","authors":["Qingchu Wu","Gaoxi Xiao"],"meta":["October 2018Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.) 28(10):103116","DOI:10.1063/1.5046714","Project: Social Contagion, Complex Networks"],"references":["325942647_The_impact_of_individual_heterogeneity_on_the_coupled_awareness-epidemic_dynamics_in_multiplex_networks","320442035_Effect_of_risk_perception_on_epidemic_spreading_in_temporal_networks","320074892_Phase_transition_of_the_susceptible-infected-susceptible_dynamics_on_time-varying_configuration_model_networks","319002921_Suppressing_epidemic_spreading_in_multiplex_networks_with_social-support","317735879_Lumping_of_Degree-Based_Mean_Field_and_Pair_Approximation_Equations_for_Multi-State_Contact_Processes","311792535_Systematic_Approximations_to_Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible_Dynamics_on_Networks","280537968_Coupled_disease-behavior_dynamics_on_complex_networks_A_review","278147746_Epidemic_spreading_on_multi-relational_networks","272184496_Two-stage_effects_of_awareness_cascade_on_epidemic_spreading_in_multiplex_networks","271537635_Diversity_of_multilayer_networks_and_its_impact_on_collaborating_epidemics","270342990_Suppression_of_epidemic_spreading_in_complex_networks_by_local_information_based_behavioral_responses","263899546_Competitive_epidemic_spreading_over_arbitrary_multilayer_networks","262525952_Epidemic_spreading_and_risk_perception_in_multiplex_networks_A_self-organized_percolation_method","261732150_Structural_measures_for_multiplex_networks","260605715_Measuring_and_modeling_correlations_in_multiplex_networks","260268511_Dynamics_of_Interacting_Diseases","260166705_Heterogeneous_pair-approximation_for_the_contact_process_on_complex_networks","257460322_Dynamical_Interplay_between_Awareness_and_Epidemic_Spreading_in_Multiplex_Networks","249966388_Modeling_epidemic_spread_with_awareness_and_heterogeneous_transmission_rates_in_networks","249317333_Statistical_mechanics_of_multiplex_networks_Entropy_and_overlap","233872715_Epidemic_thresholds_of_the_Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible_model_on_networks_A_comparison_of_numerical_and_theoretical_results","223991901_Accuracy_of_Mean-Field_Theory_for_Dynamics_on_Real-World_Networks","223991600_The_impact_of_awareness_on_epidemic_spreading_in_networks","51628216_High-Accuracy_Approximation_of_Binary-State_Dynamics_on_Networks","12044107_Epidemic_Spreading_in_Scale-Free_Networks","5617799_Risk_perception_in_epidemic_modeling","323893157_Pair_quenched_mean-field_approach_to_epidemic_spreading_in_multiplex_networks","320768186_Structure_of_growing_complex_networks_coupling_with_the_friendship_and_contact_relations","320239447_Susceptible-infected-recovered_epidemics_in_random_networks_with_population_awareness","315503038_Toward_a_generalized_theory_of_epidemic_awareness_in_social_networks","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","313157548_Critical_Behaviors_in_Contagion_Dynamics","311899572_Epidemic_processes_in_complex_networks","311612620_Unification_of_theoretical_approaches_for_epidemic_spreading_on_complex_networks","309437677_Impact_of_network_overlapping_on_dynamical_interplay_between_information_and_epidemics","308324811_Cycles_and_Clustering_in_Multiplex_Networks","303840419_Solving_the_Dynamic_Correlation_Problem_of_the_Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible_Model_on_Networks","301848039_The_limitations_of_discrete-time_approaches_to_continuous-time_contagion_dynamics","301611954_Epidemic_outbreak_for_an_SIS_model_in_multiplex_networks_with_immunization","291950131_Identifying_the_direct_risk_source_to_contain_epidemics_more_effectively","268817412_The_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Multilayer_Networks","264708826_Epidemic_processes_in_complex_networks","236050993_Vaccination_intervention_on_epidemic_dynamics_in_networks","225039974_Endemic_disease_awareness_and_local_behavioral_response","221665129_Epidemic_spreading_on_interconnected_networks","41548983_Effective_degree_network_disease_models","26720689_Mean-field_theory_of_a_recurrent_epidemiological_model","11846504_Random_Graphs_with_Arbitrary_Degree_Distributions_and_their_Applications","8058191_Host_immunity_and_synchronized_epidemics_of_syphilis_across_the_United_States","6926406_Multi-sate_epidemic_processes_on_complex_networks","5334570_Epidemic_dynamics_on_scale-free_networks_with_piecewise_linear_infectivity_and_immunization"]}
