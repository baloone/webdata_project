{"id":"330768913_A_proof-of-concept_multi-stage_biomimetic_liposomal_DNA_origami_nanosystem_for_the_remote_loading_of_doxorubicin","abstract":"One of the most promising applications of DNA origami is their use as an excellent evolution of nanostructured intelligent systems for drug delivery but, short in vivo lifetime and immune-activation are still major challenges to overcome. On the contrary, stealth liposomes have long-circulation time and are well tolerated by the immune system. To overcome DNA origami limitations, we have designed and synthesized a compact short tube DNA origami (STDO) of approximately 30 nm in length and 10 nm in width. These STDO are highly stable â‰¥48 hours in physiological conditions without any post-synthetic modifications. The compact size of STDO precisely fits inside a stealthy liposome of about 150 nm and could efficiently remotely load doxorubicin in liposomes (LSTDO) without a pH driven gradient. We demonstrated that this innovative drug delivery system (DDS) has an optimal tumoral release and high biocompatible profiles opening up new horizons to encapsulate many others hydrophobic drugs.","authors":["Stefano Palazzolo","Mohamad Hadla","Concetta Russo Spena","Samer Bayda"],"meta":["January 2019ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters 10(4):517-521","DOI:10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00557","Project: The application of Nanotechnology in Oncology"],"references":["318402325_Protein_Coating_of_DNA_Nanostructures_for_Enhanced_Stability_and_Immunocompatibility","317572257_Oligolysine-based_coating_protects_DNA_nanostructures_from_low-salt_denaturation_and_nuclease_degradation","316737445_Development_of_DNA_Nanostructures_for_High-Affinity_Binding_to_Human_Serum_Albumin","309957986_Cellular_delivery_of_enzyme-loaded_DNA_origami","291801654_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns","284184474_Daunorubicin-Loaded_DNA_Origami_Nanostructures_Circumvent_Drug-Resistance_Mechanisms_in_a_Leukemia_Model","277336263_Enhanced_Chemotherapeutic_Behavior_of_Open-Caged_DNADoxorubicin_Nanostructures_for_Cancer_Cells","233539179_Synthetic_Lipid_Membrane_Channels_Formed_by_Designed_DNA_Nanostructures","225097478_Molecularly_Self-Assembled_Nucleic_Acid_Nanoparticles_for_Targeted_In_Vivo_siRNA_Delivery","221890852_A_pH-sensitive_multifunctional_gene_carrier_assembled_via_layer-by-layer_technique_for_efficient_gene_delivery","221841931_A_Logic-Gated_Nanorobot_for_Targeted_Transport_of_Molecular_Payloads","7656529_Trashing_the_genome_The_role_of_nucleases_during_apoptosis","7237731_Rothemund_PWK_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns_Nature_440_297-302","6689970_Circulating_DNA_and_DNase_Activity_in_Human_Blood","323590593_Smart_cancer_therapy_with_DNA_origami","310743687_Bottom-Up_Synthesis_of_Carbon_Nanoparticles_with_Higher_Doxorubicin_Efficacy","309432154_Regular_Nanoscale_Protein_Patterns_via_Directed_Adsorption_through_Self-Assembled_DNA_Origami_Masks","307967367_Electrotransfection_of_Polyamine_Folded_DNA_Origami_Structures","303036731_Cationic_polymers_for_DNA_origami_coating_-_examining_their_binding_efficiency_and_tuning_the_enzymatic_reaction_rates","299354933_Self-assembly_of_size-controlled_liposomes_on_DNA_nanotemplates","278789387_Clinical_Translation_of_Nanomedicine","272142785_Stability_of_DNA_Origami_Nanostructure_under_Diverse_Chemical_Environments","267340540_Facile_and_Scalable_Preparation_of_Pure_and_Dense_DNA_Origami_Solutions","263394628_DNA_Origami_as_an_In_Vivo_Drug_Delivery_Vehicle_for_Cancer_Therapy","261325813_Virus-Inspired_Membrane_Encapsulation_of_DNA_Nanostructures_To_Achieve_In_Vivo_Stability","260041228_Frame-Guided_Assembly_of_Vesicles_with_Programmed_Geometry_and_Dimensions","236937825_Immune_sensing_of_DNA","230803520_DNA_Origami_Delivery_System_for_Cancer_Therapy_with_Tunable_Release_Properties","229158906_DNA_Origami_as_a_Carrier_for_Circumvention_of_Drug_Resistance","223965596_Doxil_R_-_The_first_FDA-approved_nano-drug_Lessons_learned","49750585_Programmable_Assembly_of_DNA-Functionalized_Liposomes_by_DNA","49740545_DNA-Templated_Protein_Arrays_for_Single-Molecule_Imaging","8101403_Timeline_Chemotherapy_and_the_War_on_Cancer","7716490_Liposomal_encapsulated_anti-cancer_drugs","6485778_Characterization_of_the_drug_retention_and_pharmacokinetic_properties_of_liposomal_nanoparticles_containing_dihydrosphingomyelin"]}
