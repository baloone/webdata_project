{"id":"225207396_Teachers'_beliefs_about_issues_in_the_implementation_of_a_student-centered_learning_environment","abstract":"Teachers’ implementation of technology-enhanced student-centered learning environments (SCLEs) will be affected by their beliefs\nabout effective practices. In order for student-centered programs to be used as intended, designers must be aware of the key\nissues that will shape their implementation and the beliefs teachers hold about these issues. This case study examined 15\nteachers’ beliefs about student-centered learning as they implemented Alien Rescue, a computer-based program for middle school\nscience that was designed to create a SCLE in the classroom. Considerations for the design of similar programs are offered.","authors":["Susan Jane Pedersen","Min Liu"],"meta":["June 2003Educational Technology Research and Development 51(2):57-76","DOI:10.1007/BF02504526"],"references":["256294652_Naturalistic_Inquiry","340713585_Employing_Cognitive_Tools_Within_Interactive_Multimedia_Applications","324393555_Beliefs_Attitudes_and_Values_A_Theory_of_Organization_and_Change","317953648_Naturalistic_inquiry","311855669_Teachers'_beliefs_and_educational_research_Clearing_up_a_messy_construct","310332339_The_Role_of_Assessment_in_a_Learning_Culture","273313944_Naturalistic_Inquiry_Sage","270085594_Beliefs_Attitudes_and_Values_A_Theory_of_Organization_and_Change","265233142_Motivational_Orientation_in_a_Problem-Based_Learning_Environment","254338425_Sharing_Our_Toys_Cooperative_Learning_Versus_Collaborative_Learning"]}
