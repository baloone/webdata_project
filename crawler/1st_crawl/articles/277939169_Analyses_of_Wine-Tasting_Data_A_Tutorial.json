{"id":"277939169_Analyses_of_Wine-Tasting_Data_A_Tutorial","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to provide a tutorial of data analysis methods for answering questions that arise in analyzing data from wine-tasting events: (i) measuring agreement of two judges and its extension to\nm\njudges; (ii) making comparisons of judges across years; (iii) comparing two wines; (iv) designing tasting procedures to reduce burden of multiple tastings; (v) ranking of judges; and (vi) assessing causes of disagreement. In each case we describe one or more analyses and make recommendations on the conditions of use for each.
