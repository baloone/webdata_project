{"id":"311755506_Effectiveness_of_semi-supervised_learning_in_bankruptcy_prediction","abstract":"Adoption of techniques from fields related with Data Science, such as Machine Learning, Data Mining and Predictive Analysis, in the task of bankruptcy prediction can produce useful knowledge for both the policy makers and the organizations that are already funding or are interested in acting towards this direction in the near future. The nature of this task prevents analysts from collecting large amount of data for building accurate predictive models. Semi-supervised algorithms overcome this phenomenon and can perform robust behavior based on a few data. Experiments using data from Greek firms have been made in this work, comparing many semi-supervised schemes against well-known supervised algorithms and the results are promising.","authors":["Stamatis Karlos","Sotiris Kotsiantis","Nikos Fazakis","Kyrgiakos Sgarbas"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1109/IISA.2016.7785435","Conference: 2016 7th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems & Applications (IISA)"],"references":["312370190_scmamp_Statistical_Comparison_of_Multiple_Algorithms_in_Multiple_Problems","266746551_A_Hybrid_Approach_of_Stepwise_Regression_Logistic_Regression_Support_Vector_Machine_and_Decision_Tree_for_Forecasting_Fraudulent_Financial_Statements","265963744_An_insight_into_the_experimental_design_for_credit_risk_and_corporate_bankruptcy_prediction_systems","254451001_Partial_Least_Square_Discriminant_Analysis_PLS-DA_for_bankruptcy_prediction","220616312_Identifying_and_Handling_Mislabelled_Instances","350006880_Corporate_Financial_Distress_and_Bankruptcy_Predict_and_Avoid_Bankruptcy_Analyze_and_Invest_in_Distressed_Debt","281313998_Data_Sample_Selection_Issues_for_Bankruptcy_Prediction","277577050_A_comparative_study_of_classifier_ensembles_for_bankruptcy_prediction","272825856_KEEL_Data-Mining_Software_Tool_Data_Set_Repository_Integration_of_Algorithms_and_Experimental_Analysis_Framework","270763730_Self-labeled_techniques_for_semi-supervised_learning_Taxonomy_software_and_empirical_study","259996828_Improving_experimental_studies_about_ensembles_of_classifiers_for_bankruptcy_prediction_and_credit_scoring","256721212_Application_of_hybrid_case-based_reasoning_for_enhanced_performance_in_bankruptcy_prediction","256050845_Using_Semi-Supervised_Classifiers_for_Credit_Scoring","229078318_Combining_Labeled_and_Unlabeld_Data_with_Co-Training","228084563_Forecasting_Corporate_Bankruptcy_with_an_Ensemble_of_Classifiers","222400744_35_Years_of_Studies_on_Business_Failure_An_Overview_of_the_Classic_Statistical_Methodologies_and_Their_Related_Problems","222186193_Comparing_four_bankruptcy_prediction_models_Logit_quadratic_interval_logit_neural_and_fuzzy_neural_networks","221196418_Forward_Semi-supervised_Feature_Selection_Based_on_Relevant_Set_Correlation","220887132_Tri-Training_and_Data_Editing_Based_Semi-Supervised_Clustering_Algorithm","220550665_Co-training_with_relevant_random_subspaces","220130602_Co-Training_by_Committee_A_Generalized_Framework_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Committees","4939397_Bankruptcy_prediction_in_banks_and_firms_via_statistical_and_intelligent_techniques_-_A_review","4375673_A_Random_Subspace_Method_for_Co-training","3297469_Tri-training_Exploiting_unlabeled_data_using_three_classifiers","2937029_Analyzing_the_Effectiveness_and_Applicability_Of_Co-Training","2457211_Combining_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Data_with_Co-Training"]}
