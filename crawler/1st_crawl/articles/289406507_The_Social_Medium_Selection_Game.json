{"id":"289406507_The_Social_Medium_Selection_Game","abstract":"We consider in this paper competition of content creators in routing their\ncontent through various media. The routing decisions may correspond to the\nselection of a social network (e.g. twitter versus facebook or linkedin) or of\na group within a given social network. The utility for a player to send its\ncontent to some medium is given as the difference between the dissemination\nutility at this medium and some transmission cost. We model this game as a\ncongestion game and compute the pure potential of the game. In contrast to the\ncontinuous case, we show that there may be various equilibria. We show that the\npotential is M-concave which allows us to characterize the equilibria and to\npropose an algorithm for computing it. We then give a learning mechanism which\nallow us to give an efficient algorithm to determine an equilibrium. We finally\ndetermine the asymptotic form of the equilibrium and discuss the implications\non the social medium selection problem.","authors":["Fabrice Lebeau","Corinne Touati","Eitan Altman","Nof Abuzainab"],"meta":["January 2016","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269297884_Cooperative_online_native_advertisement_A_game_theoretical_scheme_leveraging_on_popularity_dynamics","268437598_A_Time_and_Space_Routing_Game_Model_applied_toVisibility_Competition_on_Online_Social_Networks","267418244_On_Resource_Management_for_Cloud_Users_A_Generalized_Kelly_Mechanism_Approach","230663805_Potential_Games","280686814_Discrete_convex_analysis","266258586_Quasi_M-convex_functions_and_minimization_algorithms","265663210_Scaling_algorithms_for_M-convex_function_minimization","261238176_A_semi-dynamic_model_for_competition_over_popularity_and_over_advertisement_space_in_social_networks","261230733_A_game_theory_inspired_decentralized_local_information_based_algorithm_for_community_detection_in_social_graphs","244299185_Efficient_Rent_Seeking","233836068_Self-Organizing_Flows_in_Social_Networks","226074420_A_Class_of_Games_Possessing_Pure-Strategy_Nash_Equilibria","224151734_A_Shapley_Value-Based_Approach_to_Discover_Influential_Nodes_in_Social_Networks","221022542_Tutorial_Game_theoretic_models_for_social_network_analysis","30814834_Fundamentals_in_Discrete_Convex_Analysis","4952508_A_game_of_timing_and_visibility","4952047_Congestion_Games_with_Player-Specific_Payoff_Functions"]}
