{"id":"225399805_Purposely_Teaching_for_the_Promotion_of_Higher-order_Thinking_Skills_A_Case_of_Critical_Thinking","abstract":"This longitudinal case-study aimed at examining whether purposely teaching for the promotion of higher order thinking skills\nenhances students’ critical thinking (CT), within the framework of science education. Within a pre-, post-, and post–post\nexperimental design, high school students, were divided into three research groups. The experimental group (n = 57) consisted of science students who were exposed to teaching strategies designed for enhancing higher order thinking\nskills. Two other groups: science (n = 41) and non-science majors (n = 79), were taught traditionally, and acted as control. By using critical thinking assessment instruments, we have found\nthat the experimental group showed a statistically significant improvement on critical thinking skills components and disposition\ntowards critical thinking subscales, such as truth-seeking, open-mindedness, self-confidence, and maturity, compared with\nthe control groups. Our findings suggest that if teachers purposely and persistently practice higher order thinking strategies\nfor example, dealing in class with real-world problems, encouraging open-ended class discussions, and fostering inquiry-oriented\nexperiments, there is a good chance for a consequent development of critical thinking capabilities.","authors":["Miri Barak","David Ben-Chaim","Zoller Uri"],"meta":["October 2007Research in Science Education 37(4):353-369","DOI:10.1007/s11165-006-9029-2"],"references":["250183277_A_Developmental_Model_of_Critical_Thinking","250183126_An_Exchange_Constructivism_in_Mathematics_and_Science_Education","248975089_The_disposition_toward_critical_thinking_of_high_school_and_university_science_students_an_interintra_Israeli-Italian_Study","303282187_Constructivism_in_Mathematics_and_Science_Education","277131459_Higher_Order_Thinking_in_Science_Classrooms_Students'_Learning_and_Teachers'_Professional_Development","263058010_The_effect_of_an_interdisciplinary_algebrascience_course_on_students'_problem_solving_skills_critical_thinking_skills_and_attitudes_towards_mathematics","255744192_ALTERNATIVE_ASSESSMENT_AS_CRITICAL_MEANS_OF_FACILITATING_HOCS-PROMOTING_TEACHING_AND_LEARNING_IN_CHEMISTRY_EDUCATION","254088657_Constructing_Scientific_Knowledge_in_the_Classroom","248974455_Algorithmic_LOCS_and_HOCS_chemistry_exam_questions_Performance_and_attitudes_of_college_students","247699111_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives_The_Classification_of_Educational_Objectives"]}
