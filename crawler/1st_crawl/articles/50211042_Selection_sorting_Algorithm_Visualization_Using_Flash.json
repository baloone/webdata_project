{"id":"50211042_Selection_sorting_Algorithm_Visualization_Using_Flash","abstract":"This paper is intended to develop an algorithm visualization, particularly selection sorting for an Algorithm and Programming course. Algorithm visualization technology graphically illustrates how algorithms work. This visualization can be used to explain how all data move to the proper position in order to be sorted in a display computer for education. This research consists of 6 steps which are concept, design, obtaining content material, assembly, testing, and distribution. During the testing step, the application is run and checked to confirm that it performs exactly what the author has intended and the students can learn selection sorting algorithm by studying the visualization. Subjects of the research\nwere students at Department of Informatics Universitas Persada Indonesia YAI for implementation of the learning. The data were analysed using the analytic descriptive method and interpreted in a narrative way based on the research findings. The algorithm visualization indicates that students increase their motivation and ability to program variety of sorting in programming language they learn.","authors":["Ariesto Hadi Sutopo"],"meta":["February 2011The International journal of Multimedia & Its Applications 3(1)","DOI:10.5121/ijma.2011.3103"],"references":["243764561_Computer_Graphics-C_Version","242324779_Data_Structures_Using_Pascal","237212596_CS175_Introduction_to_Multimedia_Systems","234781293_Multimedia_Systems_Design"]}
