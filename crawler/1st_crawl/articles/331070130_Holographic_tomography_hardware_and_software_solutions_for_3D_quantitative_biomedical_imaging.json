{"id":"331070130_Holographic_tomography_hardware_and_software_solutions_for_3D_quantitative_biomedical_imaging","abstract":"In this paper, we demonstrate the current concepts in holographic tomography (HT) realized within limited angular range with illumination scanning. The presented solutions are based on the work performed at Warsaw University of Technology in Poland and put in context with the state of the art in HT. Along with the theoretical framework for HT, the optimum reconstruction process and data visualization are described in detail. The paper is concluded with the description of hardware configuration and the visualization of tomographic reconstruction, which is calculated using a provided processing path.","authors":["Arkadiusz Kus","Wojciech Krauze","Piotr L.
