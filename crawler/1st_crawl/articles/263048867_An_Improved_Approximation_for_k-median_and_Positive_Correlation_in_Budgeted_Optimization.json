{"id":"263048867_An_Improved_Approximation_for_k-median_and_Positive_Correlation_in_Budgeted_Optimization","abstract":"Dependent rounding is a useful technique for optimization problems with hard\nbudget constraints. This framework naturally leads to \\emph{negative\ncorrelation} properties. However, what if an application naturally calls for\ndependent rounding on the one hand, and desires \\emph{positive} correlation on\nthe other? More generally, we develop algorithms that guarantee the known\nproperties of dependent rounding, but also have nearly best-possible behavior -\nnear-independence, which generalizes positive correlation - on \"small\" subsets\nof the variables. The recent breakthrough of Li & Svensson for the classical\n$k$-median problem has to handle positive correlation in certain\ndependent-rounding settings, and does so implicitly. We improve upon\nLi-Svensson's approximation ratio for $k$-median from $2.732 + \\epsilon$ to\n$2.611 + \\epsilon$ by developing an algorithm that improves upon various\naspects of their work. Our dependent-rounding approach helps us improve the\ndependence of the runtime on the parameter $\\epsilon$ from Li-Svensson's\n$N^{O(1/\\epsilon^2)}$ to $N^{O((1/\\epsilon) \\log(1/\\epsilon))}$.","authors":["Jaroslaw Byrka","Thomas Pensyl","Bartosz Rybicki","Aravind Srinivasan"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611973730.50","SourcearXiv"],"references":["312971435_Local_search_heuristics_for_k-median_and_facility_location_problems","304425177_Pipage_Rounding_A_New_Method_of_Constructing_Algorithms_with_Proven_Performance_Guarantee","284735653_Centrality_of_trees_for_capacitated_-center","279835215_Improved_Algorithms_for_Vertex_Cover_with_Hard_Capacities_on_Multigraphs_and_Hypergraphs","278203648_Improved_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Combinatorial_Rectangles","268019959_The_Design_of_Approximation_Algorithms","262394007_Covering_Problems_with_Hard_Capacities","247769403_Pipage_Rounding_Pessimistic_Estimators_and_Matrix_Concentration","242913800_New_frac34Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Satisfiability_Problem","237553530_An_Improved_Approximation_Algorithm_For_Vertex_Cover_with_Hard_Capacities_Extended_Abstract","228822554_Approximation_algorithms_for_metric_facility_location_and_k-Median_problems_using_the_primal-dual_schema_and_Lagrangian_relaxation","228057623_A_constant-factor_approximation_algorithm_for_the_k-median_problem","227073401_LP-based_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Capacitated_Facility_Location","232743643_Approximating_k-Median_via_Pseudo-Approximation","226715030_Pipage_Rounding_A_New_Method_of_Constructing_Algorithms_with_Proven_Performance_Guarantee"]}
