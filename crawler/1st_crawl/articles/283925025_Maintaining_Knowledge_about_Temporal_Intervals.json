{"id":"283925025_Maintaining_Knowledge_about_Temporal_Intervals","abstract":"We have described a system for reasoning about temporal intervals that is both expressive and computationally effective. The representation captures the temporal hierarchy implicit in many domains by using a hierarchy of reference intervals, which precisely control the amount of deduction performed automatically by the system. This approach is partially partially useful in domains where temporal information is imprecise and relative, and techniques such as dating are not possible. Â© 1990 Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Inc.
