{"id":"327046544_Social_robots_for_education_A_review","abstract":"Social robots can be used in education as tutors or peer learners. They have been shown to be effective at increasing cognitive and affective outcomes and have achieved outcomes similar to those of human tutoring on restricted tasks. This is largely because of their physical presence, which traditional learning technologies lack. We review the potential of social robots in education, discuss the technical challenges, and consider how the robotâ€™s appearance and behavior affect learning outcomes.","authors":["Tony Belpaeme","James Kennedy","Aditi Ramachandran","Brian Scassellati"],"meta":["August 2018Science Robotics 3(21):eaat5954","DOI:10.1126/scirobotics.aat5954"],"references":["325707523_When_deictic_gestures_in_a_robot_can_harm_child-robot_collaboration","324663505_Teaching_Language_to_Deaf_Infants_with_a_Robot_and_a_Virtual_Human","322500326_Guidelines_for_Designing_Social_Robots_as_Second_Language_Tutors","317083975_Robot_Education_Peers_in_a_Situated_Primary_School_Study_Personalisation_Promotes_Child_Learning","314582112_Modeling_and_Evaluating_Narrative_Gestures_for_Humanlike_Robots","314158395_Child_Speech_Recognition_in_Human-Robot_Interaction_Evaluations_and_Recommendations","323592167_Thinking_Aloud_with_a_Tutoring_Robot_to_Enhance_Learning","314165918_Give_Me_a_Break_Personalized_Timing_Strategies_to_Promote_Learning_in_Robot-Child_Tutoring","314164485_Adaptive_Robot_Language_Tutoring_Based_on_Bayesian_Knowledge_Tracing_and_Predictive_Decision-Making","308845838_Pepper_learns_together_with_children_Development_of_an_educational_application"]}
