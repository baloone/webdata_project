{"id":"277341070_Strong_sum_distance_in_fuzzy_graphs","abstract":"In this paper the idea of strong sum distance which is a metric, in a fuzzy graph is introduced. Based on this metric the concepts of eccentricity, radius, diameter, center and self centered fuzzy graphs are studied. Some properties of eccentric nodes, peripheral nodes and central nodes are obtained. A characterisation of self centered complete fuzzy graph is obtained and conditions under which a fuzzy cycle is self centered are established. We have proved that based on this metric, an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree G is a fuzzy end node of G and a node is an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree if and only if it is a peripheral node of G and the center of a fuzzy tree consists of either one or two neighboring nodes. The concepts of boundary nodes and interior nodes in a fuzzy graph based on strong sum distance are introduced. Some properties of boundary nodes, interior nodes and complete nodes are studied.","authors":["Dr. Mini Tom","Muraleedharan Shetty Sunitha"],"meta":["December 2015SpringerPlus 4(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40064-015-0935-5"],"references":["312468225_Concept_of_fuzzy_planar_graphs","312092976_FUZZY_DUAL_GRAPH","303145795_On_g-eccentric_nodes_g-boundary_nodes_and_g-interior_nodes_of_a_fuzzy_graph","303145631_Fuzzy_detour_mcenter_in_fuzzy_graphs","303145354_Fuzzy_detour_g-center_of_a_fuzzy_graph","288991083_FUZZY_RELATIONS_FUZZY_GRAPHS_AND_THEIR_APPLICATIONS_TO_CLUSTERING_ANALYSISThe_research_reported_here_is_supported_in_part_by_the_National_Science_Foundation_under_Grant_No_GJ-31528","287636406_Some_metric_aspects_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_graphs","284073508_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Their_Applications_to_Cognitive_and_Decision_Processes","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","283157318_Metric_in_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs"]}
