{"id":"230179249_Effect_of_Tensile_Stress_on_the_Magnetic_Domain_Structure_of_Iron_Foils","abstract":"Thin electropolished foils of iron have been strained in an electron microscope. Their magnetic domain structures have been observed with the technique of Lorentz electron microscopy. The observed changes are consistent with theoretical predictions and macroscopic experimental studies. A simple geometrical construction is shown to explain some of the qualitative features of stress magnetization curves in small constant magnetic fields.","authors":["D. C.
