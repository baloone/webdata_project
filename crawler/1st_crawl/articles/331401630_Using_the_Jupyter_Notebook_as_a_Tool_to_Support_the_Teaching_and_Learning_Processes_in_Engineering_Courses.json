{"id":"331401630_Using_the_Jupyter_Notebook_as_a_Tool_to_Support_the_Teaching_and_Learning_Processes_in_Engineering_Courses","abstract":"Teaching and learning processes can benefit from the use of online resources, enabling the improvement of teachers and students productivity and giving them flexibility and support for collaborative work. Particularly in engineering courses, open source tools, such as Jupyter Notebook, provide a programming environment for developing and sharing educational materials, combining different types of resources such as text, images and code in several programming languages in a single document, accessible through a web browser. This environment is also suitable to provide access to online experiments and explaining how to use them. This article presents some examples of online resources supported by Jupyter Notebook, in subjects of an Informatics Engineering course, seeking to contribute to the development of innovative teaching methodologies.","authors":["Alberto Cardoso","Joaquim Leitão","César Alexandre Teixeira"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-11935-5_22","In book: Linear and Nonlinear Programming (pp.227-236)"],"references":["336150257_SOCIOLOGY_OF_SCIENCE_AND_PREDICTION","326608328_Demonstration_Using_IPython_to_Demonstrate_the_Usage_of_Remote_Labs_in_Engineering_Courses_-_A_Case_Study_Using_a_Remote_Rain_Gauge_Proceedings_of_the_15th_International_Conference_on_Remote_Engineeri","316235514_Jupyter_Notebooks_-_a_publishing_format_for_reproducible_computational_workflows","312808735_IPython_Notebook_for_Teaching_and_Learning","311489235_Creating_and_Grading_IPythonJupyter_Notebook_Assignments_with_NbGrader","277197718_Blended_Learning_in_Higher_Education_Framework_Principles_and_Guidelines","274268695_A_Programming_Language","268302007_Python_for_Signal_Processing_Featuring_IPython_Notebooks","241642345_Data_Science_and_Prediction","234812397_A_Programming_Language","3422938_IPython_A_System_for_Interactive_Scientific_Computing"]}
