{"id":"286746200_An_SDN-Based_Approach_for_Load_Balance_in_Heterogeneous_Radio_Access_Networks","abstract":"The next generation of wireless networks will integrate multiple radio access technologies, which constitute the heterogeneous network. The performance of the network and user experience will depend on a good use of the radio resource heavily. With the development of mobile Internet, a large amount of intelligent terminal applications emerge. Specifically, the multimedia applications, which will take up a lot of bandwidth, present a challenge for the load capacity of the heterogeneous networks. Software Defined Networking (SDN) will give us a solution to the load balancing of the radio access network (RAN). Firstly, we design a SDN-based load balancer to which we can apply different load balancing algorithm. Secondly, we propose a utility-based load balancing algorithm which can take both the RAN status and user needs into consideration. Finally, simulation results show that the RAN load can be balanced while giving users a good experience.","authors":["Wenqiang Tang","Qing Liao"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1109/SCAC.2014.29","Conference: 2014 IEEE Symposium on Computer Applications and Communications (SCAC)"],"references":["271548467_Architecture_on_mobility_management_in_OpenFlow-based_radio_access_networks","262240269_Performance_Analysis_of_Software-Defined_Networking_SDN","261447757_An_SDN-Based_Network_Architecture_for_Extremely_Dense_Wireless_Networks","260582890_Multi-Criteria_Optimization_of_Access_Selection_to_Improve_the_Quality_of_Experience_in_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Access_Networks","221521928_Performance_of_Adaptive_Vertical_Handoff_in_Heterogeneous_Networks_of_WLAN_and_WCDMA_Systems","4354567_On_utility_models_for_access_network_selection_in_wireless_heterogeneous_networks"]}
