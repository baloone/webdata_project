{"id":"340705916_Analysis_of_look_back_period_for_stock_price_prediction_with_RNN_variants_A_case_study_on_banking_sector_of_NEPSE","abstract":"Stock market prediction is an attempt of determining the future value of a stock traded on a stock exchange. Stock market investors try to predict the stockâ€™s future price to make trading decisions such that optimum profit can be earned. Deep learning models are found most successful in predicting stock prices. This paper has performed a novel analysis of the parameter look-back period used with recurrent neural networks and also compared stock price prediction performance of three deep learning models: Vanilla RNN, LSTM, and GRU for predicting stock prices of the two most popular and strongest commercial banks listed on Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE). From the experiments performed, it is found that GRU is most successful in stock price prediction. In addition, the research work has suggested suitable values of the look-back period that could be used with LSTM and GRU for better stock price prediction performance.","authors":["Arjun Saud","Subarna Shakya"],"meta":["January 2020Procedia Computer Science 167(2):788-798","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2020.03.419"],"references":["327484245_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Short-Term_Stock_Trends_Prediction_Based_on_Two-Stream_Gated_Recurrent_Unit_Network","325666831_NSE_Stock_Market_Prediction_Using_Deep-Learning_Models","325290684_Deep_learning_for_sequence_pattern_recognition","321735296_A_New_Model_for_Stock_Price_Movements_Prediction_Using_Deep_Neural_Network","321503983_Stock_price_prediction_using_LSTM_RNN_and_CNN-sliding_window_model","320121681_Stock_market_index_prediction_using_deep_neural_network_ensemble","318798849_Deep_learning_for_stock_market_prediction_from_financial_news_articles","322512474_Short_term_stock_price_prediction_using_deep_learning","318039640_Stock_market_direction_prediction_using_deep_neural_networks","317750904_LSTM_neural_network_with_emotional_analysis_for_prediction_of_stock_price"]}
