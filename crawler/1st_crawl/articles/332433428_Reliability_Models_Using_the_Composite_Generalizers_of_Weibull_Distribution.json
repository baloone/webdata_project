{"id":"332433428_Reliability_Models_Using_the_Composite_Generalizers_of_Weibull_Distribution","abstract":"In this article, we study the composite generalizers of Weibull distribution using exponentiated, Kumaraswamy, transmuted and beta distributions. The composite generalizers are constructed using both forward and reverse order of each of these distributions. The usefulness and effectiveness of the composite generalizers and their order of composition is investigated by studying the reliability behavior of the resulting distributions. Two sets of real-world data are analyzed using the proposed generalized Weibull distributions.","authors":["Gokarna R. Aryal","Keshav P. Pokhrel","Netra Khanal","Chris P.
