{"id":"235287465_MPhil_and_PhD_library_and_information_science_research_in_Pakistan_An_evaluation","abstract":"Purpose\n– The aim of this study is to provide an insight to international readers into the perspective of doctoral level research in Pakistan. The factors which led to the start of this program and difficulties encountered in this regard at different universities are discussed.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– The study is mainly based on review of the literature. Research theses approved at MPhil and PhD level are evaluated. Some information collected from Library and Information Science (LIS) schools through personal communication is also provided.\n\nFindings\n– The problems that did not allow success in the doctoral programs in LIS were: lack of encouragement by seniors in a real sense; low esteem for indigenous PhD degree in the eyes of fellow professionals; little or no impact of early recipients of the degree on profession; and non‐availability of financial assistance to the prospective candidates. Of the findings mention is made of: no fixed criteria for admission; the research topics do not concern the problems; and absence of proper supervision/guidance resulting in poor quality of thesis in most cases. Suggestions include: formation of a high level committee comprising senior library educators under the Higher Education Commission to work out problems and streamline the process; maintenance of close links with library schools in other countries, particularly in the English speaking world, which are interested in global librarianship.\n\nOriginality/value\n– This paper is the only evaluation of postmaster level LIS education in Pakistan. The findings are useful for planners of LIS education at postmaster level in Pakistan as well as in other developing countries.","authors":["Syed irfan Haider","Khalid Mahmood"],"meta":["May 2007Library Review 56(5):407-417","DOI:10.1108/00242530710750590"],"references":["236173152_Copyright_and_Book_Piracy_in_Pakistan","293041307_Educating_future_librarians_in_Pakistan_-_a_library_educator's_perspective","265478966_Library_Resources_in_Pakistan_Progress_Problems_and_Achievements","240754718_Status_of_Library_Research_in_Pakistan","234720787_University_Libraries_in_Pakistan","47734644_Philosophy_and_Framework_of_Collection_Management_and_Its_Application_in_University_Libraries_of_Pakistan_An_Appraisal","45941036_Coordinated_Planning_for_University_Libraries_in_Pakistan","32960789_Standards_for_Public_Libraries","28802129_Library_and_information_science_research_in_pakistani_universities","28348035_ALTERNATIVE_FUNDING_MODEL_FOR_LIBRARIES_IN_PAKISTAN"]}
