{"id":"283335132_Computing_the_Ramsey_Number_R433_using_Abstraction_and_Symmetry_breaking","abstract":"The number $R(4,3,3)$ is often presented as the unknown Ramsey number with\nthe best chances of being found \"soon\". Yet, its precise value has remained\nunknown for almost 50 years. This paper presents a methodology based on\n\\emph{abstraction} and \\emph{symmetry breaking} that applies to solve hard\ngraph edge-coloring problems. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated\nby using it to compute the value $R(4,3,3)=30$. Along the way it is required to\nfirst compute the previously unknown set ${\\cal R}(3,3,3;13)$ consisting of\n78{,}892 Ramsey colorings.","authors":["Michael Codish","Michael Frank","Avraham Itzhakov","Alice Miller"],"meta":["July 2016Constraints 21(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10601-016-9240-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["327227702_Constraints_for_symmetry_breaking_in_graph_representation","298999712_An_upper_bound_of_62_on_the_classical_Ramsey_number_R3333","268055802_Towards_the_exact_value_of_the_Ramsey_number","265699904_30R33431","265655095_Small_Ramsey_Numbers","338531284_Satisfiability_and_Computing_van_der_Waerden_Numbers","267187304_On_Computation_of_Exact_van_der_Waerden_Numbers","267091089_DRAT-trim_Efficient_Checking_and_Trimming_Using_Expressive_Clausal_Proofs","266964814_Computing_the_van_der_Waerden_number_W34293","266399007_Bridging_the_gap_between_easy_generation_and_efficient_verification_of_unsatisfiability_proofs"]}
