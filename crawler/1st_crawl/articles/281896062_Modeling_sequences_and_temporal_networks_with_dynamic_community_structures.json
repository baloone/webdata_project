{"id":"281896062_Modeling_sequences_and_temporal_networks_with_dynamic_community_structures","abstract":"Community-detection methods that describe large-scale patterns in the\ndynamics on and of networks suffer from effects of limited memory and arbitrary\ntime binning. We develop a variable-order Markov chain model that generalizes\nthe stochastic block model for discrete time-series as well as temporal\nnetworks. The temporal model does not use time binning but takes full advantage\nof the time-ordering of the tokens or edges. When the edge ordering is random,\nwe recover the traditional static block model as a special case. Based on\nstatistical evidence and without overfitting, we show how a Bayesian\nformulation of the model allows us to select the most appropriate Markov order\nand number of communities.","authors":["Tiago P.
