{"id":"261700939_Extremal_Examples_of_Collapsible_Complexes_and_Random_Discrete_Morse_Theory","abstract":"We present extremal constructions connected with the property of simplicial\ncollapsibility.\n(1) For each $d \\ge 2$, there are collapsible simplicial $d$-complexes with\nonly one free face. Also, there are non-evasive $d$-complexes with only two\nfree faces. (Both results are optimal in all dimensions.)\n(2) Optimal discrete Morse vectors need not be unique. We explicitly\nconstruct a contractible, but non-collapsible $3$-dimensional simplicial\ncomplex with face vector $f=(106,596,1064,573)$ that admits two distinct\noptimal discrete Morse vectors, $(1,1,1,0)$ and $(1,0,1,1)$. Indeed, we show\nthat in every dimension $d\\geq 3$ there are contractible, non-collapsible\nsimplicial $d$-complexes that have $(1,0,\\dots,0,1,1,0)$ and\n$(1,0,\\dots,0,0,1,1)$ as distinct optimal discrete Morse vectors.\n(3) We give a first explicit example of a (non-PL) $5$-manifold, with face\nvector $f=(5013,72300,290944,$ $495912,383136,110880)$, that is collapsible but\nnot homeomorphic to a ball.\nFurthermore, we discuss possible improvements and drawbacks of random\napproaches to collapsibility and discrete Morse theory. We will see that in\nmany instances, the \\textbf{random-revlex} strategy works better than\nBenedetti--Lutz's (uniform) random strategy in various practical instances.\nOn the theoretical side, we prove that after repeated barycentric\nsubdivisions, the discrete Morse vectors found by randomized algorithms have,\non average, an exponential (in the number of barycentric subdivisions) number\nof critical cells asymptotically almost surely.","authors":["Karim A.
