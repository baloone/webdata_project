{"id":"318661773_Information_Literacy_Instruction","abstract":"Informed citizens of all nations need to know how to find many forms of information, sift through and weigh it, and draw their own conclusions. Increasingly, access to information is tied to access to technology. In some parts of the world, a glut of information overwhelms and inundates. In other areas, information may be scarce and one-sided. Through information literacy instruction, people learn that information may appear in a variety of formats. They learn how to identify, locate, evaluate, and use information effectively and responsibly. Librarians and many others in government, business, and education can empower people through information literacy instruction and thereby help them become informed, critical thinking citizens. This next step beyond access to technology can take time, careful planning, attention to detail, support, and collaborative efforts among many different groups and individuals, including the learners themselves. The reward: An information literate populace, able to make informed decisions, based on a variety of carefully weighed evidence.","authors":["Esther Grassian","Joan Kaplowitz"],"meta":["January 2009","In book: Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences (pp.2429â€“2444)Edition: 3dPublisher: CRC PressEditors: Marcia J.
