{"id":"289219086_A_discrete-event_simulator_for_early_validation_of_avionics_systems","abstract":"The paper discusses problems arising in development of avionics systems and considers how discrete-event simulation on the base of architecture models at the early stages of avionics design can help to mitigate some of them. A tool for simulation of AADL architecture models augmented by behavioural specifications is presented and its main design decisions are discussed.","authors":["Denis Buzdalov","Alexey Khoroshilov"],"meta":["January 2014"],"references":["287544855_Tools_for_System_Design_of_Integrated_Modular_Avionics","277642528_AADL-Based_Toolset_for_IMA_System_Design_and_Integration","221473779_AADS_AADL_simulation_including_the_behavioral_annex_1","2576893_The_Discoveries_of_Continuations"]}
