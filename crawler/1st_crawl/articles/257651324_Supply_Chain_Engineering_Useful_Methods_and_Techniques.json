{"id":"257651324_Supply_Chain_Engineering_Useful_Methods_and_Techniques","abstract":"The first comprehensive analysis of concepts and models in production systems management to consider a broad perspective covering outsourcing strategies and dynamic pricing policies.\nSupply Chain Engineering considers how modern production and operations management (POM) techniques can respond to the pressures of the competitive global marketplace by integrating all activities in the supply chain, adding flexibility to the system, and drastically reducing production cost.\nSeveral POM challenges are answered through a comprehensive analysis of concepts and models that assist the selection of outsourcing strategies and dynamic pricing policies. The ramifications of these topics are discussed from local to global perspectives.\nSupply Chain Engineering also presents:\ninventory control policies,\nradio frequency identification (RFID) technologies,\nflexible and re-configurable manufacturing systems,\nreal-time assignment and scheduling methods,\nnew warehousing techniques.\nIn addition, a significant part of the book is devoted to: lean manufacturing, line balancing (assembly lines, U-lines, and bucket brigades), and dynamic facilities layout approaches.\nExplanations are given using basic examples and detailed algorithms, while discarding complex and unnecessary theoretical minutiae. Moreover, all the examples have been carefully selected with a view to eventual industrial application.\nSupply Chain Engineering is written for students and professors in industrial and systems engineering, management science, operations management, and business. It is also an informative reference for industrial managers looking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their production systems.","authors":["Alexandre Dolgui","Jean-Marie Proth"],"meta":["June 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-1-84996-017-5","Publisher: SpringerISBN: ISBN 978-1-84996-016-8, e-ISBN 978-1-84996-017-5"],"references":["289291035_Stochastic_algorithm_for_tasks_assignment_in_single_or_mixed-model_assembly_lines","274373030_On-Line_Scheduling_In_Assembly_Processes","288921928_Saving_private_luggage","285377232_A_Review_of_Assembly_Line_Balancing","284760559_CORELAP-computerized_relationsip_layout_planning","284694391_Near-optimal_layout_algorithm_based_on_simulated_annealing","280227175_An_evaluation_of_alternative_control_strategies_and_design_issure_for_automated_order_accumulation_and_sortation_systems","279411574_A_comparative_analysis_of_the_COVERT_job_sequencing_rule_using_various_shop_performance_measures","268659370_DISCON_a_new_method_for_the_layout_problem","267433268_Gestion_des_stocks_avec_couts_concaves","263528015_Optimal_routing_in_an_automated_storageretrieval_system_with_dedicated_storage","267114390_Inventory_planning_in_a_deterministic_environment_Concave_cost_set-up","264300343_Optimal_Rationing_Policies_and_Production_Quantities_for_Products_with_Several_Demand_Classes","263760922_A_cutting-plane_procedure_for_maximizing_revenues_in_yield_management","263605509_A_Comparative_Study_of_Order_Batching_Algorithms"]}
