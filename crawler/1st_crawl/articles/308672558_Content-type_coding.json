{"id":"308672558_Content-type_coding","abstract":"This paper is motivated by the observation that, in many cases, we do not need to serve specific messages, but rather, any message within a content-type. Content-type traffic pervades a host of applications today, ranging from search engines and recommender networks to newsfeeds and advertisement networks. The paper asks a novel question: if there are benefits in designing network and channel codes specifically tailored to contenttype requests. It provides three examples of content-type formulations to argue that, indeed in some cases we can have significant such benefits.","authors":["Linqi Song","Christina Fragouli"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/NETCOD.2015.7176784","Conference: 2015 International Symposium on Network Coding (NetCod)"],"references":["276296076_Content-type_coding","224571215_Broadcast_erasure_channel_with_feedback_-_Capacity_and_algorithms","224213240_Threshold_Saturation_via_Spatial_Coupling_Why_Convolutional_LDPC_Ensembles_Perform_So_Well_over_the_BEC","3737294_Informed-source_coding-on-demand_ISCOD_over_broadcast_channels","261270740_Pliable_Index_Coding","261116653_Pliable_Index_Coding_The_multiple_requests_case","224506304_Channel_Polarization_A_Method_for_Constructing_Capacity-Achieving_Codes_for_Symmetric_Binary-Input_Memoryless_Channels","220682991_Network_Information_Flow","220411114_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication"]}
