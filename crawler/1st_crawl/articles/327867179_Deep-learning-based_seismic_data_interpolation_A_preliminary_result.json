{"id":"327867179_Deep-learning-based_seismic_data_interpolation_A_preliminary_result","abstract":"Seismic data interpolation is a longstanding issue. Most current methods are just suitable for random missing cases. To deal with regular missing cases, anti-aliasing strategy should be included. However, seismic survey design using a random distribution of shots and receivers is always operationally challenging and impractical. We propose to use deep learning (DL) based approaches for seismic data anti-aliasing interpolation which can extract deeper features of the training data in a nonlinear way by self-learning. It can also avoid linear events, sparsity and low rank assumptions of the traditional interpolation methods. Based on the convolutional neural networks (CNN), the 8 layer residual learning networks (ResNets) with better back propagation property for deep layers is designed for interpolation. Detailed training analysis is also provided. A set of simulated data is used to train the designed ResNets. The performance is assessed with several synthetic and field data. Numerical examples show that the trained ResNets can help reconstruct regular missing traces with a high accuracy. The interpolated results in both the time-space domain and the frequency-wavenumber (FK) domain demonstrate the validity of the trained ResNets. Even though the accuracy decreases with the increase of the feature difference between the test data and the training data, the proposed method can still provide reasonable interpolation results. Finally, the trained ResNets is used to reconstruct dense data with halved trace intervals for synthetic and field data. The reconstructed dense data is more continuous along the spatial direction, and the spatial aliasing effects disappear in the FK domain. The reconstructed dense data has the potential to improve the accuracy for subsequent seismic data processing and inversion.","authors":["Benfeng Wang","Ning Zhang","Wenkai lu","Jialin Wang"],"meta":["September 2018Geophysics 84(6)","DOI:10.1190/geo2017-0495.1"],"references":["315136530_What_can_machine_learning_do_for_seismic_data_processing_An_interpolation_application","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","283620894_Double-weave_3D_seismic_acquisition_-_Part_2_Seismic_modeling_and_subsurface_fold_analyses","282389882_Parallel_matrix_factorization_algorithm_and_its_application_to_5D_seismic_reconstruction_and_denoising","281155055_Dealiased_Seismic_Data_Interpolation_Using_Seislet_Transform_With_Low-Frequency_Constraint","265873450_Beyond_alias_hierarchical_scale_curvelet_interpolation_of_regularly_and_irregularly_sampled_seismic_data","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","264552416_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","259932298_Seismic_trace_interpolation_in_the_f-x_domain_using_half-step_prediction_filters","258787824_Convergence_improvement_and_noise_attenuation_considerations_for_beyond_alias_projection_onto_convex_sets_reconstruction","258647568_A_fast_reduced-rank_interpolation_method_for_prestack_seismic_volumes_that_depend_on_four_spatial_dimensions","252129364_Seismic_trace_interpolation_using_half-step_prediction_filters","249866256_Five-dimensional_interpolation_Recovering_from_acquisition_constraints","249866127_Multistep_autoregressive_reconstruction_of_seismic_records","240737727_f-x_adaptive_seismic-trace_interpolation","228909514_Accurate_interpolation_with_high-resolution_time-variant_Radon_transform","228738145_Minimum_weighted_norm_interpolation_of_seismic_records","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","320968363_Photo-Realistic_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_a_Generative_Adversarial_Network","318754577_Deghosting_based_on_the_Transmission_matrix_method","317550686_Multi-Attribute_Classification_Based_On_Sparse_Autoencoder_-_A_Gas_Chimney_Detection_Example","316748442_Geophysical_Journal_International_Simultaneous_denoising_and_reconstruction_of_5-D_seismic_data_via_damped_rank-reduction_method","314227022_A_scalable_deep_learning_platform_for_identifying_geologic_features_from_seismic_attributes","314226903_Time-lapse_reservoir_property_change_estimation_from_seismic_using_machine_learning","311916542_Five-Dimensional_Seismic_Reconstruction_Using_Parallel_Square_Matrix_Factorization","311610731_Accurate_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","309076254_Gradientbased_learning_applied_to_document_recognition","305920222_One-Step_Slope_Estimation_for_Dealiased_Seismic_Data_Reconstruction_via_Iterative_Seislet_Thresholding","305716708_An_Efficient_POCS_Interpolation_Method_in_the_Frequency-Space_Domain","304609656_Simultaneous_denoising_and_reconstruction_of_5D_seismic_data_via_damped_rank-reduction_method","284570525_An_Improved_Weighted_Projection_Onto_Convex_Sets_Method_for_Seismic_Data_Interpolation_and_Denoising","276412414_A_novel_method_for_simultaneous_seismic_data_interpolation_and_noise_removal_based_on_the_L0_constraint","275056802_Simultaneous_seismic_data_interpolation_and_denoising_with_a_new_adaptive_method_based_on_dreamlet_transform","269068887_Rank-reduction-based_trace_interpolation","265386991_Dreamlet-based_interpolation_using_POCS_method","260501974_Three-dimensional_irregular_seismic_data_reconstruction_via_low-rank_matrix_completion","249866060_3D_interpolation_of_irregular_data_with_a_POCS_algorithm","249864938_Seismic_trace_interpolation_in_F-X_domain","242382675_Wave-equation_trace_interpolation","228789313_Estimation_of_Multiple_scattering_by_Iterative_inversion_part_II_Practical_Aspects_and_Examples","2447409_Nonuniform_fast_Fourier_transform"]}
