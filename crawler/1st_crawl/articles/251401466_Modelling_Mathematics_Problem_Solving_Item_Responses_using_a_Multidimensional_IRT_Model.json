{"id":"251401466_Modelling_Mathematics_Problem_Solving_Item_Responses_using_a_Multidimensional_IRT_Model","abstract":"This research examined studentsâ€™ responses to mathematics problem-solving tasks and applied a general multidimensional IRT\nmodel at the response category level. In doing so, cognitive processes were identified and modelled through item response\nmodelling to extract more information than would be provided using conventional practices in scoring items. More specifically,\nthe study consisted of two parts. The first part involved the development of a mathematics problem-solving framework that\nwas theoretically grounded, drawing upon research in mathematics education and cognitive psychology. The framework was then\nused as the basis for item development. The second part of the research involved the analysis of the item response data. It\nwas demonstrated that multidimensional IRT models were powerful tools for extracting information from a limited number of\nitem responses. A problem-solving profile for each student could be constructed from the results of IRT scaling.","authors":["Margaret Wu","Raymond J.
