{"id":"261211772_A_Tight_Linear_Time_12-Approximation_For_Unconstrained_Submodular_Maximization","abstract":"We consider the Unconstrained Submodular Maximization problem in which we are given a non-negative submodular function f : 2N → ℝ+, and the objective is to find a subset S ⊆ N maximizing f(S). This is one of the most basic submodular optimization problems, having a wide range of applications. Some well known problems captured by Unconstrained Submodular Maximization include MaxCut, Max-DiCut, and variants of Max-SAT and maximum facility location. We present a simple randomized linear time algorithm achieving a tight approximation guarantee of 1/2, thus matching the known hardness result of Feige et al. [11]. Our algorithm is based on an adaptation of the greedy approach which exploits certain symmetry properties of the problem. Our method might seem counterintuitive, since it is known that the greedy algorithm fails to achieve any bounded approximation factor for the problem.","authors":["Niv Buchbinder","Moran Feldman","Joseph (Seffi) Naor","Roy Schwartz"],"meta":["October 2012Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on 44(5):649-658","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2012.73","Conference: Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on"],"references":["228720638_Gadgets_Approximation_and_Linear_Programming","227447178_The_Data-Correcting_Algorithm_for_the_Minimization_of_Supermodular_Functions","227444947_Note--On_Location_of_Bank_Accounts_to_Optimize_Float_An_Analytic_Study_of_Exact_and_Approximate_Algorithms","227444614_Location_of_Bank_Accounts_to_Optimize_Float_An_Analytic_Study_of_Exact_and_Approximate_Algorithms","226824402_The_Ellipsoid_Method_and_its_Consequences_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","226183350_A_Multilevel_Search_Algorithm_for_the_Maximization_of_Submodular_Functions_Applied_to_the_Quadratic_Cost_Partition_Problem","225662604_Nonmonotone_Submodular_Maximization_via_a_Structural_Continuous_Greedy_Algorithm","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","221023353_Optimal_marketing_strategies_over_social_networks","220987423_Revenue_Submodularity","220779818_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions_Subject_to_Multiple_Linear_Constraints","220589470_Maximizing_a_class_of_submodular_utility_functions","220138499_Optimal_inapproximability_results_for_MAX-CUT_and_other_2-variable_CSPs","4787417_The_maximization_of_submodular_functions_old_and_new_proofs_for_the_correctness_of_the_dichotomy_algorithm","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","265365884_On_the_Uncapacitated_Location_Problem","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","241623668_From_query_complexity_to_computational_complexity","228704803_Approximating_the_Least_Core_Value_and_Least_Core_of_Cooperative_Games_with_Supermodular_Costs","228578139_Cooperative_cuts_graph_cuts_with_submodular_edge_weights","226551679_Accelerated_greedy_algorithms_for_maximizing_submodular_set_functions","226386259_Submodular_Maximization_over_Multiple_Matroids_via_Generalized_Exchange_Properties","224354152_Submodular_Approximation_Sampling-based_Algorithms_and_Lower_Bounds","222306805_An_0828-approximation_algorithm_for_the_uncapacitated_facility_location_problem","221591306_Optimal_approximation_for_the_Submodular_Welfare_Problem_in_the_value_oracle_model","221499530_Dependent_Randomized_Rounding_via_Exchange_Properties_of_Combinatorial_Structures","221499396_Submodular_Function_Minimization_under_Covering_Constraints","221498436_A_Unified_Continuous_Greedy_Algorithm_for_Submodular_Maximization","220779820_Combinatorial_approximation_algorithms_for_the_maximum_directed_cut_problem","220618371_Maximizing_Non-Monotone_Submodular_Functions","220617298_Maximizing_a_Monotone_Submodular_Function_Subject_to_a_Matroid_Constraint","220533377_Maximizing_Nonmonotone_Submodular_Functions_under_Matroid_or_Knapsack_Constraints","51947040_Symmetry_and_Approximability_of_Submodular_Maximization_Problems","51913120_Submodular_Function_Maximization_via_the_Multilinear_Relaxation_andContention_Resolution_Schemes","45928450_Submodular_Maximization_by_Simulated_Annealing","45904904_Constrained_Non-Monotone_Submodular_Maximization_Offline_and_Secretary_Algorithms","4758297_Maximizing_a_submodular_function_by_integer_programming_Polyhedral_results_for_the_quadratic_case","2493479_Some_optimal_inapproximability_results","2457699_0878_approximation_algorithms_for_MAX_CUT_and_MAX_2-SAT_Proc_26th_ACM_Symp_Theory_Comput1994_422-431_Updated_as_Improved_approximation_algorithms_for_maximum_cut_and_satisfiability_problems_using_semi"]}
