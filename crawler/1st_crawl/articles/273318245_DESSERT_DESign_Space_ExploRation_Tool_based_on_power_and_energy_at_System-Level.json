{"id":"273318245_DESSERT_DESign_Space_ExploRation_Tool_based_on_power_and_energy_at_System-Level","abstract":"This paper proposes DESSERT (DESign Space ExploRation Tool at System-Level), a novel simulation-based tool for heterogeneous multi-core processor based platforms. This tool supports power/energy estimation, comprehensive architectural explorations and optimization of the given embedded applications for multi-core processor architectures. The development of DESSERT consists of three steps. First, we developed generic functional-level power models for different parts of the multi-core system to estimate power/energy, which are integrated into the system-level simulation environment. Second, we built a SystemC-based virtual platform prototype of the processor architecture to accurately extract the functional activities needed by the power model. Third, we designed a runtime task-dependencies management and optimization technique (work-load or dynamic slack reclamation) based on programming models that support both OpenMP and Pthread API for multi-core execution to consider both data-level and thread-level parallelism. The combination of above three steps leads to a novel Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology. Power and energy estimates are validated against real board measurements. DESSERT power/energy estimation results provide less than 5% of error and offer reliable power/energy based DSE for the given applications.","authors":["Santhosh Kumar Rethinagiri","Oscar Palomar","Adrian Cristal","Osman Unsal"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1109/SOCC.2014.6948898","Conference: System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC), 2014 27th IEEE International"],"references":["256474437_A_System-Level_Infrastructure_for_Multidimensional_MP-SoC_Design_Space_Co-Exploration","234812672_Rapid_design_space_exploration_of_heterogeneous_embedded_systems_using_symbolic_search_and_multi-granular_simulation","234779274_SYSTEMCODESIGNER-An_Automatic_ESL_Synthesis_Approach_by_Design_Space_Exploration_and_Behavioral_Synthesis_for_Streaming_Applications","224173491_ArchExplorer_for_Automatic_Design_Space_Exploration","221005540_McPAT_An_integrated_power_area_and_timing_modeling_framework_for_multicore_and_manycore_architectures","220244788_The_gem5_simulator","314813409_Rapid_design_space_exploration_of_heterogeneous_embedded_systems_using_symbolic_search_and_multi-granular_simulation","271556015_PETS_Power_and_energy_estimation_tool_at_system-level","264240794_System-Level_Power_and_Energy_Estimation_Methodology_for_Open_Multimedia_Applications_Platforms","262362922_System-level_power_estimation_tool_for_embedded_processor_based_platforms","262242002_Heracles_A_Tool_for_Fast_RTL-Based_Design_Space_Exploration_of_Multicore_Processors","220541397_A_Systematic_Design_Space_Exploration_of_MPSoC_Based_on_Synchronous_Data_Flow_Specification"]}
