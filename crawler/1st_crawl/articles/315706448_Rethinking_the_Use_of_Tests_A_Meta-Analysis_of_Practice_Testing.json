{"id":"315706448_Rethinking_the_Use_of_Tests_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Practice_Testing","abstract":"The testing effect is a well-known concept referring to gains in learning and\nretention that can occur when students take a practice test on studied material\nbefore taking a final test on the same material. Research demonstrates that\nstudents who take practice tests often outperform students in nontesting learning\nconditions such as restudying, practice, filler activities, or no presentation\nof the material. However, evidence-based meta-analysis is needed to develop\na comprehensive understanding of the conditions under which practice tests\nenhance or inhibit learning. This meta-analysis fills this gap by examining the\neffects of practice tests versus nontesting learning conditions. Results reveal\nthat practice tests are more beneficial for learning than restudying and all\nother comparison conditions. Mean effect sizes were moderated by the features\nof practice tests, participant and study characteristics, outcome constructs,\nand methodological features of the studies. Findings may guide the\nuse of practice tests to advance student learning, and inform students, teachers,\nresearchers, and policymakers. This article concludes with the theoretical\nand practical implications of the meta-analysis.","authors":["Narayankripa Sundararajan","Olusola O.
