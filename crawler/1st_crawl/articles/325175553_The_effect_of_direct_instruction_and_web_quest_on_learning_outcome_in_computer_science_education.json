{"id":"325175553_The_effect_of_direct_instruction_and_web_quest_on_learning_outcome_in_computer_science_education","abstract":"Answers to the questions of which instructional methods are suitable for school and should be applied in teaching individual subjects and also how instructional methods support the act of learning represent challenges to general education and education in individual subjects. This study focuses on the empirical examination of learning outcome with respect to two instructional methods: direct instruction and web quest. An SPF-2 × 2•2 design is used to control instructional method, time and class context. Learning outcome on QR code is assessed with reference to multiple-choice test items. The empirical findings show that learning with direct instruction performs better than web quest.","authors":["Andreas Zendler","K.
