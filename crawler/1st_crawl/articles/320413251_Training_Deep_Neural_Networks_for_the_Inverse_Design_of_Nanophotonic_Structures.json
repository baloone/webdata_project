{"id":"320413251_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_the_Inverse_Design_of_Nanophotonic_Structures","abstract":"Data inconsistency leads to a slow training process when deep neural networks are used for the inverse design of photonic devices, an issue that arises from the fundamental property of non-uniqueness in all inverse scattering problems. Here we show that by combining forward modeling and inverse design in a tandem architecture, one can overcome this fundamental issue, allowing deep neural networks to be effectively trained by data sets that contain non-unique electromagnetic scattering instances. This paves the way for using deep neural networks to design complex photonic structures that requires large training sets.","authors":["Dianjing Liu","Yixuan Tan","Zongfu Yu"],"meta":["October 2017ACS Photonics 5(4)","DOI:10.1021/acsphotonics.7b01377"],"references":["277975045_An_integrated-nanophotonics_polarization_beamsplitter_with_24_24_mm2_footprint","274403306_Inverse_design_and_demonstration_of_a_compact_and_broadband_on-chip_wavelength_demultiplexer","274086472_Trainable_hardware_for_dynamical_computing_using_error_backpropagation_through_physical_media","226570658_Maximizing_band_gaps_in_two-dimensional_photonic_crystals_by_using_level_set_methods","3132288_Neural_Network_Inverse_Modeling_and_Applications_to_Microwave_Filter_Design","308965117_Deep_Learning_with_Coherent_Nanophotonic_Circuits","272749385_Metasurface_holograms_reaching_80_efficiency","259877359_Flat_optics_with_designer_metasurfaces","256688557_S4_A_free_electromagnetic_solver_for_layered_periodic_structures","232086802_Robust_optimization_of_adiabatic_tapers_for_coupling_to_slow-light_photonic-crystal_waveguides","228348507_Optimization_of_aperiodic_dielectric_structures","227852428_Neural_network_applications_in_microwave_device_design","222797300_Multilayer_Feedforward_Networks_are_Universal_Approxmations_Neural_Networks_2_No_5_359-366","23425738_Low_modal_volume_dipole-like_dielectric_slab_resonator","5627541_Optical_Implementation_Of_The_Hopfield_Model","3120477_Reverse_modeling_of_microwave_circuits_with_bidirectional_neural_network_models"]}
