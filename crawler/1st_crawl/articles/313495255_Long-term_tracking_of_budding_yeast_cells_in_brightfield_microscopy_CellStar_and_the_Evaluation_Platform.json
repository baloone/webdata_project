{"id":"313495255_Long-term_tracking_of_budding_yeast_cells_in_brightfield_microscopy_CellStar_and_the_Evaluation_Platform","abstract":"With the continuous expansion of single cell biology, the observation of the behaviour of individual cells over extended durations and with high accuracy has become a problem of central importance. Surprisingly, even for yeast cells that have relatively regular shapes, no solution has been proposed that reaches the high quality required for long-term experiments for segmentation and tracking (S&T) based on brightfield images. Here, we present CellStar, a tool chain designed to achieve good performance in long-term experiments. The key features are the use of a new variant of parametrized active rays for segmentation, a neighbourhood-preserving criterion for tracking, and the use of an iterative approach that incrementally improves S&T quality. A graphical user interface enables manual corrections of S&T errors and their use for the automated correction of other, related errors and for parameter learning. We created a benchmark dataset with manually analysed images and compared CellStar with six other tools, showing its high performance, notably in long-term tracking. As a community effort, we set up a website, the Yeast Image Toolkit, with the benchmark and the Evaluation Platform to gather this and additional information provided by others.","authors":["Cristian Versari","Szymon Stoma","Kirill Batmanov","Artemis Llamosi"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of The Royal Society Interface 14(127):20160705","DOI:10.1098/rsif.2016.0705"],"references":["290182023_What_Population_Reveals_about_Individual_Cell_Identity_Single-Cell_Parameter_Estimation_of_Models_of_Gene_Expression_in_Yeast","281650581_On_the_Digital_Trail_of_Mobile_Cells","271424689_Yeast_cell_detection_and_segmentation_in_bright_field_microscopy","260155433_A_benchmark_for_comparison_of_cell_tracking_algorithms","259388495_PombeX_Robust_Cell_Segmentation_for_Fission_Yeast_Transillumination_Images","305384554_LEVER_Software_tools_for_segmentation_tracking_and_lineaging_of_proliferating_cells","281991273_Handbook_of_Biomedical_Imaging_Methodologies_and_Clinical_Research","275325407_Accurate_Cell_Segmentation_in_Microscopy_Images_using_Membrane_Patterns","265426020_Algorithms_for_the_Assignment_and_Transportation_Problems","258655688_Cell_Segmentation_50_Years_Down_the_Road_Life_Sciences"]}
