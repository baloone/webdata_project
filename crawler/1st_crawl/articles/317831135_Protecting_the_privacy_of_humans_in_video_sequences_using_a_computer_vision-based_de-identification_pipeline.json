{"id":"317831135_Protecting_the_privacy_of_humans_in_video_sequences_using_a_computer_vision-based_de-identification_pipeline","abstract":"We propose a computer vision-based de-identification pipeline that enables automated protection of privacy of humans in video sequences through obfuscating their appearance, while preserving the naturalness and utility of the de-identified data. Our pipeline specifically addresses de-identifying soft and non-biometric features, such as clothing, hair, skin color etc., which often remain recognizable when simpler techniques such as blurring are applied. Assuming a surveillance scenario, we combine background subtraction based on Gaussian mixtures with an improved version of the GrabCut algorithm to find and segment pedestrians. De-identification is performed by altering the appearance of the segmented pedestrians through the neural art algorithm that uses the responses of a deep neural network to render the pedestrian images in a different style. Experimental evaluation is performed both by automated classification and through a user study. Results suggest that the proposed pipeline successfully de-identifies a range of hard and soft biometric and non-biometric identifiers, including face, clothing and hair.","authors":["Karla Brkić","Tomislav Hrkać","Zoran Kalafatic"],"meta":["November 2017Expert Systems with Applications 87:41-55","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2017.05.067"],"references":["271659917_Mapping_Appearance_Descriptors_on_3D_Body_Models_for_People_Re-identification","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","281548282_People_detection_in_surveillance_Classification_and_evaluation","259350447_Human36M_Large_Scale_Datasets_and_Predictive_Methods_for_3D_Human_Sensing_in_Natural_Environments"]}
