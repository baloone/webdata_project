{"id":"335335182_Sequentialising_Nested_Systems","abstract":"In this work, we investigate the proof theoretic connections between sequent and nested proof calculi. Specifically, we identify general conditions under which a nested calculus can be transformed into a sequent calculus by restructuring the nested sequent derivation (proof) and shedding extraneous information to obtain a derivation of the same formula in the sequent calculus. These results are formulated generally so that they apply to calculi for intuitionistic, normal modal logics and negative modalities.","authors":["Elaine Pimentel","Revantha Ramanayake","Bj√∂rn Lellmann"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-29026-9_9","In book: Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods, 28th International Conference, TABLEAUX 2019, London, UK, September 3-5, 2019, Proceedings (pp.147-165)"],"references":["317686348_Sequent_Systems_for_Negative_Modalities","314092817_Modularisation_of_Sequent_Calculi_for_Normal_and_Non-normal_Modalities","296678631_Sequent_Calculi_with_Context_Restrictions_and_Applications_to_Conditional_Logic","280561781_Linear_Nested_Sequents_2-Sequents_and_Hypersequents","267111975_Nested_Sequents_for_Intuitionistic_Logics","266237303_Correspondence_between_Modal_Hilbert_Axioms_and_Sequent_Rules_with_an_Application_to_S5","238507454_Sequent_Systems_for_Modal_Logics","225983892_The_Method_of_Tree-Hypersequents_for_Modal_Propositional_Logic","220266246_Non-commutativity_and_MELL_in_the_Calculus_of_Structures","325989751_A_Semantical_View_of_Proof_Systems","312657216_Uniform_cut-free_formulations_of_T_S4_and_S5_abstract","275748872_Investigations_into_Logical_Deduction","270698461_A_unified_semantic_framework_for_fully_structural_propositional_sequent_systems","266256909_Proof_Methods_for_Modal_and_Intuitionistic_Logic","262159774_Cut_Elimination_in_Nested_Sequents_for_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logics","238766985_Investigations_into_Logical_Deduction_II","227220144_Indexed_Systems_of_Sequents_and_Cut-Elimination","226570137_Deep_Sequent_Systems_for_Modal_Logic","222479325_Simple_consequence_relations","220706011_Deep_Sequent_Systems_for_Modal_Logic","220695785_Labelled_Non-Classical_Logics","220298004_Cut-Free_Sequent_Calculi_for_Some_Tense_Logics","38354212_Eine_Darstellung_der_Intuitionistischen_Logik_in_der_Klassischen","2575784_The_Method_Of_Hypersequents_In_The_Proof_Theory_Of_Propositional_Non-Classical_Logics"]}
