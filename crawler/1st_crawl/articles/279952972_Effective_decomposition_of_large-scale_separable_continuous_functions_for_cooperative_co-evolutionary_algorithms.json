{"id":"279952972_Effective_decomposition_of_large-scale_separable_continuous_functions_for_cooperative_co-evolutionary_algorithms","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the performance of cooperative co-evolutionary (CC) algorithms on large-scale fully-separable continuous optimization problems. We have shown that decomposition can have significant impact on the performance of CC algorithms. The empirical results show that the subcomponent size should be chosen small enough so that the subcomponent size is within the capacity of the subcomponent optimizer. In practice, determining the optimal size is difficult. Therefore, adaptive techniques are desired by practitioners. Here we propose an adaptive method, MLSoft, that uses widely-used techniques in reinforcement learning such as the value function method and softmax selection rule to adapt the subcomponent size during the optimization process. The experimental results show that MLSoft is significantly better than an existing adaptive algorithm called MLCC on a set of large-scale fully-separable problems.","authors":["Mohammmad Nabi Omidvar","Yi Mei","Xiaodong Li"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1109/CEC.2014.6900420","Conference: 2014 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","Project: Divide and Conquer Large Scale Optimisation"],"references":["261562928_Benchmark_Functions_for_the_CEC'2013_Special_Session_and_Competition_on_Large-Scale_Global_Optimization","259868445_Cooperative_Co-Evolution_With_Differential_Grouping_for_Large_Scale_Optimization","228932005_Benchmark_functions_for_the_CEC'2008_special_session_and_competition_on_large_scale_global_optimization","313151683_Test_functions_for_optimization_needs","304425270_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","292730264_A_cooperative_coevolutionary_approach_to_function_optimisation","285237745_DE-a_simple_and_efficient_heuristic_for_global_optimization_over_continuous_space","274869757_Handbook_of_Parametric_and_Nonparametric_Statistical_Procedures","257680585_Evolutionary_Optimization_Pitfalls_and_Booby_Traps","242328157_An_analysis_of_the_behavior_of_a_class_of_genetic_algorithms"]}
