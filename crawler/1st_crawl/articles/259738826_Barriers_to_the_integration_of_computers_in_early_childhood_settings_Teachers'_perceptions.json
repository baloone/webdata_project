{"id":"259738826_Barriers_to_the_integration_of_computers_in_early_childhood_settings_Teachers'_perceptions","abstract":"This study investigated teachers’ perceptions of barriers to using-integrating computers in early childhood settings. A 26-item questionnaire was administered to 134 early childhood teachers in Greece. Lack of funding, lack of technical and administrative support, as well as inadequate training opportunities were among the major perceived barriers to the use of computers in early childhood settings. Four barrier-factors were extracted: “lack of support”, “lack of confidence”, “lack of equipment” and “class conditions”. Teachers’ confidence with technology had a direct significant effect on the factors “lack of support” and “class conditions” (number of computers and number of children in class). The greater teachers’ confidence with technology, the minor teachers’ perceived barriers regarding support and class conditions. Teachers’ confidence with technology and the existence of a computer resulted in higher probability of computer use in class. Implications of findings for in-service teacher training are discussed.","authors":["Kleopatra Nikolopoulou","Vasilis Gialamas"],"meta":["June 2015Education and Information Technologies 20(2):285-301","DOI:10.1007/s10639-013-9281-9","Project: Χρήση και αξιοποίηση των ΤΠΕ στην προσχολική εκπαίδευση: μελέτες περίπτωσης στην Αττική (2008-2011)"],"references":["313712747_A_review_of_pedagogy_related_to_information_and_communications_technology","271622410_Digital_Equity_New_Findings_from_the_Early_Childhood_Longitudinal_Study","265683274_Educational_Software_Use_in_Kindergarten","263538729_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_in_Pre-school_Settings_a_review_of_the_literature_Technologies_de_l'information_et_de_la_communication_dans_le_cadre_prescolaire_une_revue_de_la_litterature_","247757513_Using_computers_in_early_childhood_classroomsTeachers'_attitudes_skills_and_practices","242098288_Digital_Equity_New_Findings_from_the_Early_Childhood_Longitudinal_Study","238433194_New_Technologies_in_Early_Childhood_Literacy_Research_A_Review_of_Research","238433186_A_Researcher_Goes_to_School_Using_Technology_in_the_Kindergarten_Literacy_Curriculum","233300292_A_review_of_pedagogy_related_to_information_and_communication_technology","232982407_Barriers_to_the_use_of_technology_in_Jordanian_pre-school_settings","232837345_Teachers'_Perceptions_barriers_and_supports_to_using_technology_in_the_classroom","228915881_A_Dynamic_Framework_to_Guide_the_Implementation_and_Evaluation_of_Educational_Technologies","228557118_Strip_Mining_for_Gold_Research_and_Policy_in_Educational_Technology-A_Response_to_Fool's_Gold","228352980_Barriers_to_the_Successful_Integration_of_ICT_in_Teaching_and_Learning_Environments_A_Review_of_the_Literature","227230709_Missing_the_Boat_with_Technology_Usage_in_Early_Childhood_Settings_A_21st_Century_View_of_Developmentally_Appropriate_Practice","225718499_ICT_use_in_the_teaching_of_mathematics_Implications_for_professional_development_of_pre-service_teachers_in_Ghana","225668789_Integrating_technology_into_K-12_teaching_and_learning_Current_knowledge_gaps_and_recommendations_for_future_research","223779879_Barriers_to_adopting_technology_for_teaching_and_learning_in_Oman","222704677_A_scale_for_monitoring_students'_attitudes_to_learning_mathematics_with_technology","220495975_Technology_and_young_children_How_4-7_year_olds_perceive_their_own_use_of_computers","220140015_The_beliefs_behind_the_teacher_that_influences_their_ICT_practices","313744794_Alternative_ways_of_assessing_model_fit","309032267_Cutoff_criteria_for_fit_indexes_in_covariance_structure_analysis_Conventional_criteria_versus_new_alternatives","304259942_Identifying_the_factors_that_influence_computer_use_in_the_early_childhood_classroom","281345377_IBM_SPSS_statistics_for_windows_version_200","255658606_Buried_Treasure_The_Impact_of_Computer_Use_on_Young_Children's_Social_Cognitive_Language_Development_and_Motivation","255567580_Computers_for_Cognitive_Development_in_Early_Childhood-The_Teacher's_Role_in_the_Computer_Learning_Environment","255567433_Preschool_Teacher's_Conceptions_of_Computers_and_Play","255566574_Factors_That_Influence_Elementary_Teachers_Use_of_Computers","249020198_Leadership_of_information_technology_for_teacher_education_A_discussion_of_complex_systems_with_dynamic_models_to_inform_shared_leadership","239666604_Alternative_Ways_of_Assessing_Model_Fit","239408549_Analyzing_Models_With_Unobserved_Variables_Analysis_of_Covariance_Structures","235913760_Alternative_Ways_of_Assessing_Model_Fit","233182461_The_Role_of_Beliefs_in_the_Use_of_Information_Technology_implications_for_teacher_education_or_teaching_the_right_thing_at_the_right_time","228079281_Cutoff_Criteria_for_Fit_Indexes_in_Covariance_Structure_Analysis_Conventional_Criteria_Versus_New_Alternatives","223950378_Activity_Theory_as_a_conceptual_framework_for_understanding_teacher_approaches_to_Information_and_Communication_Technologies","222650247_Obstacles_to_the_integration_of_ICT_in_education_Results_from_a_worldwide_educational_assessment","222633525_In-service_and_pre-service_early_childhood_teachers'_views_and_intentions_about_ICT_use_in_early_childhood_settings_A_comparative_study","41529890_Enhancing_learning_with_information_and_communication_technologies_in_pre-school","7964058_Barriers_to_the_use_of_assistive_technology_for_children_with_multiple_disabilities"]}
