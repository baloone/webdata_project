{"id":"295743494_Efficient_Assessment_on_Hierarchical_Clustering_Algorithms_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks are composed of large number of power constrained nodes, which needs an energy conservation protocols to reduce the energy consumption as much as possible. Utilizing clustering algorithms is a common method of implementing network management and data aggregation in WSNs. This paper presents a review on the clustering algorithms proposed for wireless sensor networks.","authors":["Kalaiprasath .R","R Kalaipriya","N Arulkumaran"],"meta":["February 2016International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) 5(2):2319-7064"],"references":["266875673_Modify_LEACH_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network","220670260_Improvement_on_LEACH_protocol_of_wireless_sensor_network_VLEACH","4203179_A_two-levels_hierarchy_for_low-energy_adaptive_clustering_hierarchy_TL-LEACH","313442203_Energy_efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_micro_sensor_networks","238978595_Balakrishnan_energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_microsensor_networks","224732684_The_Architectural_Organization_of_a_Mobile_Radio_Network_via_a_Distributed_Algorithm","224294825_Research_and_Improvement_of_LEACH_Protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220419315_An_Energy_Efficient_Clustering_Scheme_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3842621_Max-min_D-cluster_formation_in_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","3436561_A_Comment_on_HEED_A_Hybrid_Energy-Efficient_Distributed_Clustering_Approach_for_Ad_Hoc_Sensor_Networks'"]}
