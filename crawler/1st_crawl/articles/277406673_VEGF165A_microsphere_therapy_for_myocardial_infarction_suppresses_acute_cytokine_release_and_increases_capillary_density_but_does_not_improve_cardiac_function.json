Reliable and prolonged local delivery of intact proteins such as VEGF is however notoriously difficult. Our objective was to create a platform for local angiogenesis in human-sized hearts, using polyethylene-glycol/polybutylene-terephthalate (PEG-PBT) microsphere-based VEGF165A delivery. PEG-PBT microspheres were biocompatible, distribution was size dependent and a regimen of 10·10(6) 15µm microspheres at 0.5·10(6) per minute did not induce cardiac necrosis. Efficacy, studied in a porcine model of AMI with reperfusion rather than chronic ischemia used for most reported VEGF studies, shows that microspheres were retained for at least 35 days. Acute VEGF165A release attenuated early cytokine release upon reperfusion and produced a dose dependent increase in microvascular density at 5 weeks following AMI. However, it did not improve major variables for global cardiac function, left ventricular dimensions, infarct-size or scar composition (collagen and myocyte content). Taken together, controlled VEGF165A delivery is safe, attenuates early cytokine release and leads to a dose dependent increase in microvascular density, but does not translate into changes in global or regional cardiac function and scar composition.\nCopyright © 2014, American Journal of Physiology - Heart and Circulatory Physiology.","authors":["André Uitterdijk","Tirza Springeling","Matthijs van Kranenburg","Richard van Duin"],"meta":["May 2015AJP Heart and Circulatory Physiology 309(3):ajpheart.00698.2014","DOI:10.1152/ajpheart.00698.2014","SourcePubMed"],"references":["256501366_Impact_of_intracoronary_bone_marrow_cell_therapy_on_left_ventricular_function_in_the_setting_of_ST-segment_elevation_myocardial_infarction_A_collaborative_meta-analysis","336526649_Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_binds_to_fibrinogen_and_fibrin_and_stimulates_endothelial_cell_proliferation","284043867_The_inflammatory_response_in_myocardial_infarction","271044829_Minimal_impairment_of_myocardial_blood_flow_responses_to_exercise_in_the_remodeled_left_ventricle_early_after_myocardial_infarction_despite_significant_hemodynamic_and_neurohumoral_alterations","263712165_Cell_therapy_for_human_ischemic_heart_diseases_Critical_review_and_summary_of_the_clinical_experiences","261104199_Intracoronary_Stem_Cell_Infusion_After_Acute_Myocardial_Infarction_A_Meta-Analysis_and_Update_on_Clinical_Trials","257762909_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Clinical_Outcomes_Reported_in_Stem_Cell_Trials_for_Acute_Myocardial_Infarction_Some_Thoughts_for_Design_of_Future_Trials","253333692_Enhanced_infarct_stabilization_and_neovascularization_mediated_by_VEGF-loaded_PEGylated_fibrinogen_hydrogel_in_a_rodent_myocardial_infarction_model","250925001_Serial_measurement_of_hFABP_and_high_sensitivity_Troponin_I_post_PCI_in_STEMI_How_fast_and_accurate_can_Myocardial_Infarct_Size_and_No-Reflow_be_predicted","238293684_Microspheres_for_protein_delivery_prepared_from_amphiphilic_multiblock_copolymers"]}
