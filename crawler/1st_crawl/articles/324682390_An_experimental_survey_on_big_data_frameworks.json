{"id":"324682390_An_experimental_survey_on_big_data_frameworks","abstract":"Recently, increasingly large amounts of data are generated from a variety of sources.Existing data processing technologies are not suitable to cope with the huge amounts of generated data. Yet, many research works focus on Big Data, a buzzword referring to the processing of massive volumes of (unstructured) data. Recently proposed frameworks for Big Data applications help to store, analyze and process the data. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of Big Data and we survey existing Big Data frameworks. We also present an experimental evaluation and a comparative study of the most popular Big Data frameworks with several representative batch and iterative workloads. This survey is concluded with a presentation of best practices related to the use of studied frameworks in several application domains such as machine learning, graph processing and real-world applications.","authors":["Wissem Inoubli","Sabeur Aridhi","Haithem Mezni","Mondher Maddouri"],"meta":["April 2018Future Generation Computer Systems 86(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2018.04.032","Projects: TempoGraphs:  Analyzing big data with time-dependent graphs and machine learningAnalysis of Large Dynamic Graphs"],"references":["321149692_Big_Data_Machine_Learning_using_Apache_Spark_MLlib","317159290_MR-SimLab_Scalable_Subgraph_Selection_with_Label_Similarity_for_Big_Data","317071244_Revisiting_the_Design_of_Data_Stream_Processing_Systems_on_Multi-Core_Processors","314145280_A_comparison_on_scalability_for_batch_big_data_processing_on_Apache_Spark_and_Apache_Flink","313451303_Performance_evaluation_of_big_data_frameworks_for_large-scale_data_analytics","327766351_Building_Smart_Cities_Analytics_ICT_and_Design_Thinking","324442756_Big_Data_20_Processing_Systems_A_Survey","312917980_The_Google_file_system","312786525_Apache_Ambari","312775005_MapReduce_Simplified_data_processing_on_large_clusters"]}
