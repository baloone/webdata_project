{"id":"335656668_Fuzzification_of_Zero_Forcing_Process","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the fuzzfi�cation of zero forcing process. For this, f�irst we introduce a new embedding of a graph G by considering a minimal zero forcing set of G and an arbitrary list of maximal forcing chains of this zero forcing set. Then we get a comparing between zero forcing sets of a graph by using fuzzy concepts. Finally, we give an application for this procedure.","authors":["Rajabali Borzooei","Behnaz Sheikh Hoseini","Masoumeh Golmohamadian","Zeinab Montazeri"],"meta":["September 2019New Mathematics and Natural Computation 16(3)","DOI:10.1142/S179300572050012X","Project: New concept of vague soft graphs"],"references":["289951972_A_Study_on_Fuzzy_Labeling_Graphs","279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","24148164_Indirect_Hamiltonian_Identification_through_a_small_gateway","5915600_Full_Control_by_Locally_Induced_Relaxation","2477877_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_through_a_Social_Network","1925396_Local_controllability_of_quantum_networks","324330479_Fuzzy_Graph_Theory_with_Applications_to_Human_Trafficking","323731791_t-Norm_Fuzzy_Graphs","285584265_Cayley_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","267665410_Zero_forcing_sets_and_the_minimum_rank_of_graphs","267657293_Dynamical_processes_on_complex_networks_Reprint_of_the_2008_hardback_ed","258319062_Nondiscriminatory_propagation_on_trees","249957834_Computation_of_minimal_rank_and_path_cover_number_for_graphs","237092150_Contagious_Sets_in_Expanders","234778358_Dynamic_Processes_on_Complex_Networks","51915599_Graph_bootstrap_percolation","45905415_Zero_forcing_parameters_and_minimum_rank_problems"]}
