{"id":"258793137_2-D_Wavelet_Packet_Spectrum_for_Texture_Analysis","abstract":"This brief derives a 2-D spectrum estimator from some recent results on the statistical properties of wavelet packet coefficients of random processes. It provides an analysis of the bias of this estimator with respect to the wavelet order. This brief also discusses the performance of this wavelet-based estimator, in comparison with the conventional 2-D Fourier-based spectrum estimator on texture analysis and content-based image retrieval. It highlights the effectiveness of the wavelet-based spectrum estimation.","authors":["A.M.
