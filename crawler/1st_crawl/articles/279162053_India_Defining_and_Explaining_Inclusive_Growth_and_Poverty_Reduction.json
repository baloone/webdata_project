{"id":"279162053_India_Defining_and_Explaining_Inclusive_Growth_and_Poverty_Reduction","abstract":"We document the evolution of poverty and inequality across Indian states during the recent period of rapid growth (2004-09), and examine the role of growth and distribution in reducing poverty. Robust economic growth has been a major driver of poverty reduction and inclusiveness in India. We explore the role of economic policies and macrofinancial conditions in explaining inclusive growth and its components, using a new measure of inclusive growth. Social expenditures, spending on education, and educational attainment rates are important for fostering inclusive growth. Macro-financial stability, with particular attention to inflation risks, is also criticial for promoting inclusive growth.","authors":["Rahul Anand","Volodymyr Tulin","Naresh Kumar"],"meta":["January 2014IMF Working Papers 14(63)","DOI:10.5089/9781484354230.001"],"references":["222687368_Why_Has_Economic_Growth_Been_More_Pro-Poor_in_Some_States_of_India_than_Others","5125543_India_Is_the_Rising_Tide_Lifting_All_Boats","5124812_Mind_the_Gap_-_Is_Economic_Growth_in_India_Leaving_Some_States_Behind","286258489_Inequality_and_Unsustainable_Growth_Two_Sides_of_the_Same_Coin","274164069_Data_and_Dogma_The_Great_Indian_Poverty_Debate","273032097_Inclusive_Growth_Measurement_and_Determinants","265788992_Options_and_Strategies_for_Fiscal_Consolidation_in_India","262126234_Determinants_of_Expenditure_on_Education_An_Empirical_Analysis_Using_State_Level_Data","246550847_Is_Indias_Economic_Growth_Leaving_the_Poor_Behind","24091291_Economic_Growth_in_a_Cross_Section_Of_Countries","23548775_Where_Has_All_the_Education_Gone","5217627_Top_Indian_Incomes_1922-2000","5124507_When_is_Growth_Pro-Poor_Cross-Country_Evidence","5077851_Growth_and_Redistribution_Components_of_Changes_in_Poverty_Measures","4989738_Why_Have_Some_Indian_States_Done_Better_Than_Others_at_Reducing_Rural_Poverty"]}
