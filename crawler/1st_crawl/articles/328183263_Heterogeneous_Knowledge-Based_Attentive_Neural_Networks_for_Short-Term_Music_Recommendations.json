{"id":"328183263_Heterogeneous_Knowledge-Based_Attentive_Neural_Networks_for_Short-Term_Music_Recommendations","abstract":"The current existing data in online music service platforms is heterogeneous, extensive, and disorganized. Finding an effective method to use these data in recommending appropriate music to users during a short-term session is a significant challenge. Another serious problem is that most of data, in reality, obey the long-tailed distribution, which consequently leads to traditional music recommendation systems recommending a lot of popular music that users do not like on a specific occasion. To solve these problems, we propose a heterogeneous knowledge-based attentive neural network (HK-ANN) model for short-term music recommendations. First, we collect three types of data for modeling entities in user-music interaction network, i.e., graphic, textual, and visual data and then embed them into high-dimensional spaces using the TansR, PV-DM, and VAE methods respectively. The concatenation of these embedding results is an abstract representation of the entity. Based on this, a recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism is built that is capable of obtaining usersâ€™ preferences in the current session and consequently making recommendations. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the current stateof- the-art short-term music recommendation systems on one real world dataset. In addition, it can also recommend more relatively unpopular songs compared with classic models.","authors":["Qika Lin","Yaoqiang Niu","Yifan Zhu","Hao lu"],"meta":["October 2018IEEE Access 6:58990 - 59000","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2874959","Project: Intelligent knowledge service in educational and academic scenarios"],"references":["323244320_Improving_music_recommendation_by_incorporating_social_influence","322073208_Learning_to_embed_music_and_metadata_for_context-aware_music_recommendation","321846860_Use_of_Deep_Learning_in_Modern_Recommendation_System_A_Summary_of_Recent_Works","320385043_Sequence-based_context-aware_music_recommendation","320772034_Research_of_Music_Recommendation_System_Based_on_User_Behavior_Analysis_and_Word2vec_User_Emotion_Extraction","320672683_Music_recommendation_based_on_embedding_model_with_user_preference_and_context","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","319770369_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","319770229_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","319770134_Stochastic_Backpropagation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Deep_Generative_Models"]}
