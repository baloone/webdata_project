{"id":"304530478_Effect_of_In-Vehicle_Audio_Warning_System_on_Driver's_Speed_Control_Performance_in_Transition_Zones_from_Rural_Areas_to_Urban_Areas","abstract":"Speeding is a major contributing factor to traffic crashes and frequently happens in areas where there is a mutation in speed limits, such as the transition zones that connect urban areas from rural areas. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of an in-vehicle audio warning system and lit speed limit sign on preventing drivers' speeding behavior in transition zones. A high-fidelity driving simulator was used to establish a roadway network with the transition zone. A total of 41 participants were recruited for this experiment, and the driving speed performance data were collected from the simulator. The experimental results display that the implementation of the audio warning system could significantly reduce drivers' operating speed before they entered the urban area, while the lit speed limit sign had a minimal effect on improving the drivers' speed control performance. Without consideration of different types of speed limit signs, it is found that male drivers generally had a higher operating speed both upstream and in the transition zones and have a larger maximum deceleration for speed reduction than female drivers. Moreover, the drivers who had medium-level driving experience had the higher operating speed and were more likely to have speeding behaviors in the transition zones than those who had low-level and high-level driving experience in the transition zones.","authors":["Xuedong Yan","Jiali Wang","Jiawei Wu"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 13(7):634","DOI:10.3390/ijerph13070634"],"references":["294728313_Identifying_Smartphone_Based_Intelligent_Messages_for_Worker's_Crossing_in_Work_Zone","292965349_Peer_pressure_and_risk_taking_in_young_drivers'_speeding_behavior","283713252_SPEEDING_DRIVING_BEHAVIOUR_AGE_AND_GENDER_EXPERIMENTAL_ANALYSIS","277815935_Identifying_demographical_effects_on_speed_patterns_in_work_zones_using_smartphone_based_audio_warning_message_system","276254712_Drivers'_Smart_Assistance_System_Based_on_Radio_Frequency_Identification","266404781_Speed_change_management_for_New_Zealand_roads","265059535_An_analysis_of_young_drivers_involved_in_crashes_using_in-depth_crash_investigation_data","237250995_Travelling_Speed_and_the_Risk_of_Crash_Involvement_on_Rural_Roads","231177438_Reducing_young_driver_crash_casualties_in_Great_Britain_-_Use_of_routine_police_crash_data_to_estimate_the_potential_benefits_of_graduated_driver_licensing","17791459_Distortion_of_drivers'_estimates_of_automobile_speed_as_a_function_of_speed_adaptation","301509018_Identifying_Demographical_Effects_on_Speed_Patterns_in_Work_Zones_Using_Smartphone_Based_Audio_Warning_Message_System","295399194_Exploration_of_Older_Drivers'_Speeding_Behavior","289274844_Setting_location_of_speed_limit_signs_along_highway","283520775_Peer_pressure_and_risk_taking_in_young_drivers'_speeding_behavior","282944359_Speeding_in_urban_environments_Are_the_time_savings_worth_the_risk","281449770_Gateway_design_assessment_in_the_transition_from_high_to_low_speed_areas","279754297_The_psychosocial_purpose_of_driving_and_its_relationship_with_the_risky_driving_behavior_of_young_novice_drivers","279580820_Aberrant_driving_behaviour_Errors_and_violations","270293058_The_influence_of_in-vehicle_speech_warning_timing_on_drivers'_collision_avoidance_performance_at_signalized_intersections","263371535_Hazard_and_Risk_Perception_among_Young_Novice_Drivers","262342351_Effects_of_foggy_conditions_on_drivers'_speed_control_behaviors_at_different_risk_levels","262077204_An_argument_for_prioritizing_drivers_above_the_current_illegal_limit_in_the_United_States","261369364_Effect_of_Audio_In-vehicle_Red_Light-Running_Warning_Message_on_Driving_Behavior_Based_on_a_Driving_Simulator_Experiment","261326725_Intelligent_Speed_Adaptation_and_driving_speed_Effects_of_different_system_HMI_functionalities","249278447_Age_difference_in_risky_driving","245130614_The_effects_of_personality_and_gender_on_risky_driving_behaviour_and_accident_involvement","238077995_A_Review_of_Simplified_Streetscape_Schemes","235647115_Fractions_of_fatal_crashes_attributable_to_speeding_Evolution_for_the_period_2001-2010_in_France","233837689_Gender_differences_and_demographic_influences_in_perceived_concern_for_driver_safety_and_support_for_impaired_driving_countermeasures","51818943_Effects_of_in-vehicle_warning_information_displays_with_or_without_spatial_compatibility_on_driving_behaviors_and_response_performance","51101436_Prevalence_of_teen_driver_errors_leading_to_serious_motor_vehicle_crashes","22394466_A_Field_Study_of_the_Effects_of_Drivers'_Adaptation_to_Automobile_Velocity","22191191_The_Influence_of_Adaptation_on_Subjective_Velocity_for_an_Observer_in_Simulated_Rectilinear_Motion","19419514_Accident_Risk_and_Risk-Taking_Behavior_Among_Young_Drivers","15527013_Aberrant_driving_behaviour_Errors_and_violations","7951322_Intelligent_speed_adaptation_Accident_savings_and_cost-benefit_analysis","7509907_Driving_speed_and_the_risk_of_road_crashes_A_review","6913074_Characteristics_of_speeders"]}
