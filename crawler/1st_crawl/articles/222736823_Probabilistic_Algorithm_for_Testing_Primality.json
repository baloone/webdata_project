{"id":"222736823_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_Testing_Primality","abstract":"We present a practical probabilistic algorithm for testing large numbers of arbitrary form for primality. The algorithm has the feature that when it determines a number composite then the result is always true, but when it asserts that a number is prime there is a provably small probability of error. The algorithm was used to generate large numbers asserted to be primes of arbitrary and special forms, including very large numbers asserted to be twin primes. Theoretical foundations as well as details of implementation and experimental results are given.","authors":["Michael O Rabin"],"meta":["February 1980Journal of Number Theory 12(1):128-138","DOI:10.1016/0022-314X(80)90084-0"],"references":["280690051_Riemann's_Hypothesis_and_Tests_for_Primality","268931685_On_composite_numbers_P_which_satisfy_the_Fermat_congruence_a_P-1_1_mod_P","265659564_Probabilistic_algorithms","242529555_The_Art_of_Computing_Programming","239582382_On_composite_numbers_which_satisfy_the_Fermat_congruence","220618453_A_Fast_Monte-Carlo_Test_for_Primality"]}
