{"id":"313992379_Location_Hotelling_Games_and_Applications","abstract":"This article provides an introduction into the Hotelling literature of spatial and product differentiation. We examine the impact of the market structure on price competition and equilibrium differentiation. We find that spatial differentiation is not uniformly high or low but depends on a number of market parameters such as transport costs, demand elasticity, number of firms, and density of consumers, among others.\n\nKeywords:\n\nHotelling applications;\nspatial competition;\nmill pricing;\ndiscriminatory pricing;\nprinciple of maximum differentiation","authors":["Steffen Brenner"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.1002/9780470400531.eorms0477","In book: Wiley Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science"],"references":["24047872_Monopolistic_Competition_With_Outside_Goods","4995472_Estimating_Markups_and_Market_Conduct_with_Multidimensional_Product_Attributes","4977359_Location_Location_Location","4900917_On_the_Strategic_Choice_of_Spatial_Price_Policy","4782151_The_Principle_of_Minimum_Differentiation_Reconsidered_Some_New_Developments_in_the_Theory_of_Spatial_Competition","343787115_Product_location_choice_and_firm_capabilities_evidence_from_the_US_automobile_industry","299064281_The_east_end_the_west_end_and_king's_cross_On_clustering_in_the_four-player_hotelling_game","284856405_Spatial_Price_Discrimination","276949297_On_the_Nature_of_Competition_with_Differentiated_Products","273054345_Variety_Equity_and_Efficiency","265637771_Existence_of_Equilibrium_Configurations_of_Competitive_Firms_on_an_Infinite_Two-Dimensional_Space","264466895_Restoring_the_Principle_of_Minimum_Differentiation_in_Product_Positioning","229454103_Product_location_choice_and_firm_capabilities_Evidence_from_the_US_Automobile_industry","227458525_The_Theory_of_Industrial_Organization","223707583_Product_Differentiation_and_Endogenous_Disutility","223164617_Two-stage_two-dimensional_spatial_competition_between_two_firms","223115840_On_Hotelling's_Competition_with_Non-Uniform_Customer_Distributions","222988770_Asymmetric_Equilibria_in_Price_Competition","222861191_Location_Cooperation_and_Communication_An_Experimental_Examination","222719011_More_on_Hotelling's_Stability_in_Competition","222484538_Pricing_Policy_in_Spatial_Competition_E","222472947_Minimal_and_Maximal_Product_Differentiation_in_Hotelling's_Duopoly","222469263_Equilibrium_existence_in_the_circle_model_with_linear_quadratic_transport_cost","222448955_On_the_limits_and_possibilities_of_the_principle_of_minimum_differentiation","24133103_Hotelling's_Main_Street'_With_More_Than_Two_Competitors","24105780_Optimum_Location_in_Spatial_Competition","24048852_Partial_Collusion_Fosters_Minimum_Product_Differentiation","24048513_Sophisticated_Entry_in_a_Model_of_Spatial_Competition","5210907_Theory_and_Experiments_on_Spatial_Planning","5010314_Product_Variety_and_Welfare_under_Discriminatory_and_Mill_Pricing_Policies","4992876_Price-Matching_Policy_and_the_Principle_of_Minimum_Differentiation","4955425_Product_differentiation_and_price_collusion","4914829_Hotelling_Games_with_Three_Four_and_More_Players","4896523_Spatial_Price_Competition_A_Semiparametric_Approach","4850858_Hotelling's_competition_with_general_customer_distributions","4837063_Competition_in_Multi-characteristics_Spaces_Hotelling_Was_Almost_Right","4815202_Aggregation_and_Imperfect_Competition_On_the_Existence_of_Equilibrium","4814412_On_Hotelling's_Stability_in_Competition","4782844_Monopolistic_Competition_and_General_Purpose_Goods","4782152_Nonexistence_of_Equilibrium_for_the_2-Dimensional_3-Firm_Location_Problems","4770503_A_Generalized_Model_of_Horizontal_Product_Differentiation","4755937_Equilibrium_Existence_in_the_Linear_Model_of_Spatial_Competition"]}
