{"id":"241349093_Study_of_an_Electrochemically-Deposited_3D-Fractal_Tree_Monopole_Antenna","abstract":"In this paper, a 3D fractal-tree monopole antenna was realized using electrochemical deposition technique. Experimental results on a the return loss over the band 1-20 GHz and radiation patterns at all resonating frequencies were presented. The multiband electromagnetic behavior of the antenna was studied and compared to a previously reported 2D fractal-tree antenna studied by C. Puente and al. It is shown that the impedance bandwidth of the 3D structure were improved compared to the reported 2D structure with less dense band distribution. The resonating bands of the fractal structure are related to the length distribution over the fractal shape. Results for the 3D fractal-tree antenna structure show the expected self-similar behavior.","authors":["Hatem Rmili","Otman El Mrabet","Jean Marie Floch","J.-L.
