{"id":"221591132_On_Lattices_Learning_with_Errors_Random_Linear_Codes_and_Cryptography","abstract":"Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as GapSVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the “learning from parity with error” problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., nonquantum).\nWe also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is of size Õ( n ² ) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of Õ( n ) (in previous cryptosystems these values are Õ( n ⁴ ) and Õ( n ² ), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length Õ( n ² ), the size of the public key can be reduced to Õ( n ).","authors":["Oded Regev"],"meta":["January 2005Journal of the ACM 56(6):84-93","DOI:10.1145/1568318.1568324","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 37th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, Baltimore, MD, USA, May 22-24, 2005"],"references":["238747500_A_hierarchy_of_polynomial_time_basis_reduction_algorithms","221010567_Multi-bit_Cryptosystems_Based_on_Lattice_Problems","50863306_Factoring_Polynomials_with_Rational_Coefficients","2871731_Lattice_Problems_in_NP_cap_coNP","2200425_A_classical_one-way_function_to_confound_quantum_adversaries","283374822_Advanced_Lectures_in_Mathematics","267668168_Lattices_and_Codes","267019580_Representing_hard_lattices_with_Onlogn_bits_extended_abstract","266920710_Generating_hard_instance_of_lattice_problems","265589651_Lattice_problems_in_NP_coNP","246658296_Lattice_problems_in_NP_intersect_coNP","238727493_Complexity_of_Lattice_Problems_A_Cryptographic_Perspective","225951520_New_bounds_in_some_transference_theorems_in_the_geometry_of_numbers","225507873_On_Lovasz'_lattice_reduction_and_the_nearest_lattice_point_problem","222423888_Cryptographic_hardness_for_learning_intersections_of_halfspaces","221591873_Trapdoors_for_hard_lattices_and_new_cryptographic_constructions","221591691_A_Public-Key_Cryptosystem_with_Worst-CaseAverage-Case_Equivalence","221590123_Representing_hard_lattices_with_On_log_n_bits","221580635_Relations_between_Average_Case_Complexity_and_Approximation_Complexity","221462712_On_Bounded_Distance_Decoding_for_General_Lattices","221354889_A_Framework_for_Efficient_and_Composable_Oblivious_Transfer","221354194_Simultaneous_Hardcore_Bits_and_Cryptography_against_Memory_Attacks","220779210_On_polynomial_approximation_to_the_shortest_lattice_vector_length","220618103_Almost_Perfect_Lattices_the_Covering_Radius_Problem_and_Applications_to_Ajtai's_Connection_Factor","220336843_A_Framework_for_Efficient_and_Composable_Oblivious_Transfer","220333928_Lossy_Trapdoor_Functions_and_Their_Applications","220268439_Noise-tolerant_learning_the_parity_problem_and_the_statistical_query_model","220155004_A_Hierarchy_of_Polynomial_Time_Lattice_Basis_Reduction_Algorithms","220138708_Almost_Perfect_Lattices_the_Covering_Radius_Problem_and_Applications_to_Ajtai's_Connection_Factor","220138343_A_Pubic-Key_Cryptosystem_with_Worst-CaseAverage-Case_Equivalence","200524403_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information","4257907_Limits_on_the_Hardness_of_Lattice_Problems_in_ell_p_Norms","4109355_Worst-Case_to_Average-Case_Reductions_Based_on_Gaussian_Measures","4038151_More_on_Average_Case_vs_Approximation_Complexity","3728319_An_improved_worst-case_to_average-case_connection_for_lattice_problems","3501865_How_to_recycle_random_bits","2927158_Cryptographic_Primitives_Based_on_Hard_Learning_Problems","2713183_Generating_Hard_Instances_of_Lattice_Problems_Extended_Abstract","2579215_An_Improved_Worst-Case_to_Average-Case_Connection_for_Lattice_Problems","2566752_New_Lattice_Based_Cryptographic_Constructions","2489870_A_Sieve_Algorithm_for_the_Shortest_Lattice_Vector_Problem","2237814_Approximating_Shortest_Lattice_Vectors_is_Not_Harder_Than_Approximating_Closest_Lattice_Vectors","2188657_Creating_superpositions_that_correspond_to_efficiently_integrable_probability_distributions"]}
