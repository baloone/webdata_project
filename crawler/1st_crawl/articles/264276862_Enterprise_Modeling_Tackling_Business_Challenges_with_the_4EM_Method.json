{"id":"264276862_Enterprise_Modeling_Tackling_Business_Challenges_with_the_4EM_Method","abstract":"Enterprise modeling (EM) methods and techniques are indispensable for understanding the present situation of an enterprise and for preparing for its future – particularly in times of continuous organizational change, an increasing pace of innovation, new market challenges or technology advances.\n\nThe authors combine a detailed description of the 4EM methodology with their concrete experience gathered in projects. Their book addresses the modeling procedure, modeling language and modeling practices in a uniquely integrated approach. It provides practical advice on common challenges faced by enterprises and offers a flexible EM method suitable for tackling those challenges. Much of the work presented stems from actual research projects and has been validated with scientific methods. The 4EM methodology has proven its practical value in a large number of successful development and/or change management projects in industry and the public sector.\n\nThe book was written for anyone who wants to learn more about EM, with a specific focus on how to do it in practice and/or how to teach it. Its main target audience thus includes instructors in the field of EM or business information systems, students in Information Systems or Business Administration, and practitioners working in enterprise or change management. The authors describe a clear reading path for each of these audiences and complement the work with a set of slides and further teaching material available on an accompanying website.","authors":["Kurt Sandkuhl","Janis Stirna","Anne Persson","Matthias Wißotzki"],"meta":["September 2014","Edition: 2014Publisher: SpringerISBN: 978-3662437247"],"references":[]}
