{"id":"340167480_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_Economic_Research-Ekonomska_Istrazivanja_2007-2019","abstract":"Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja is an international journal in the research field of business and economics and firstly published in 2007. In this paper, we make a bibliometric analysis of publications in Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja from 2007 to 2019. According to Web of Science (WoS), we derive 831 publications in the journal after data pre-processing. First, we explore characteristics of publications and citations based on widely recognised bibliometric indicators. Second, we present the influential countries/regions and influential institutions of publications in the journal. Next, we illustrate science mapping analysis according to two visualisation tools that are VOS viewer and CiteSpace. Specifically, co-citation networks and co-authorship networks are conducted to analyse connection of items. We generate bust detection analysis to identify the emerging cited authors and cited journals. Co-occurrence analysis and timeline view analysis of keywords are developed to detect the hot topics and trend of the journal. Finally, we make some discussions about future challenges of the journal in terms of the above analysis. This paper helps in objectively understanding the development of Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja and provides a valuable reference for the scholars in business and economics.","authors":["Xinxin Wang","Zeshui Xu","Marinko Škare"],"meta":["January 2020Ekonomska Istraživanja / Economic Research 33(1):865-886","DOI:10.1080/1331677X.2020.1737558"],"references":["335242342_A_bibliometric_overview_of_the_International_Journal_of_Strategic_Property_Management_between_2008_and_2019","332685205_The_evolution_of_Technological_and_Economic_Development_of_Economy_a_bibliometric_analysis","330658686_Nested_probabilistic-numerical_linguistic_term_sets_in_two-stage_multi-attribute_group_decision_making","329784509_Digital_competences_computer_skills_and_information_literacy_in_secondary_education_mapping_and_visualization_of_trends_and_concepts","350549429_Bibliometric_Analysis_on_Research_Trends_of_International_Journal_of_Computers_Communications_Control","333673942_Supply_chain_of_renewable_energy_A_bibliometric_review_approach","332921010_Research_Trends_in_Food_Chemistry_A_bibliometric_Review_of_its_40_years_Anniversary_1976-2016","331786484_Review_Important_Contributions_in_Development_and_Improvement_of_the_Heat_Integration_Techniques","330781494_On_Lampposts_Sneetches_and_Stars_A_Call_to_Go_Beyond_Bibliometrics_for_Determining_Academic_Value","328065691_Renewable_energy_source_integration_into_power_networks_research_trends_and_policy_implications_A_bibliometric_and_research_actors_survey_analysis"]}
