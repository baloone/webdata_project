{"id":"304629545_Google_Glass_in_the_Operating_Room_The_Plastic_Surgeon's_Perspective","abstract":"New technologies and innovations are common in the delivery of modern health care. Google Glass is one such device gaining increased attention in medical specialties. The authors surveyed residents and attending physicians in the Department of Plastic Surgery, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, on their experience using Google Glass in the operating room. Ease of use, quality of images, gaze disruption, and distraction during surgery were measured. Overall, subjects found the device to be comfortable and satisfying to wear and use during surgery to capture images of good quality. Despite some identified weaknesses, Google Glass is a unique technology with a promising plastic surgical application in the operating room.","authors":["Jeremy C Sinkin","Omar Rahman","Maurice Y Nahabedian"],"meta":["July 2016Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 138(1):298-302","DOI:10.1097/PRS.0000000000002307"],"references":["267746004_Emerging_Technology_in_Surgical_Education_Combining_Real-Time_Augmented_Reality_and_Wearable_Computing_Devices","260212853_Google_Glass_In_Pediatric_Surgery_An_Exploratory_Study","280535204_Google_Glass_as_an_Alternative_to_Standard_Fluoroscopic_Visualization_for_Percutaneous_Fixation_of_Hand_Fractures_A_Pilot_Study","272836610_Looking_at_Plastic_Surgery_through_Google_Glass_Part_1_Systematic_Review_of_Google_Glass_Evidence_and_the_First_Plastic_Surgical_Procedures","272096994_Video-Based_Self-Review_Comparing_Google_Glass_and_GoPro_Technologies","268520385_Medical_applications_of_near-eye_display_devices_An_exploratory_study","268234443_First_Look_Google_Glass_in_Dermatology_Mohs_Surgery_and_Surgical_Reconstruction","266151266_Google_Glass_Dermatologic_and_Cosmetic_Surgery_Applications","263096691_The_use_of_real-time_digital_video_in_the_assessment_of_post-operative_outcomes_of_breast_reconstruction","259350095_Commentary_Google_Glass_A_Head-up_Display_to_Facilitate_Teaching_and_Learning","257249895_Doctors_among_early_adopters_of_Google_Glass","47792927_An_Eye_Movement_Analysis_of_the_Effect_of_Interruption_Modality_on_Primary_Task_Resumption","40769163_Gaze_disruptions_experienced_by_the_laparoscopic_operating_surgeon","7877336_Easy_perioperative_photography_by_digital_camera_covered_with_a_sterile_nylon_bag","5865849_Disruptions_in_Surgical_Flow_and_Their_Relationship_to_Surgical_Errors_An_Exploratory_Investigation"]}
