{"id":"230715878_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"We describe a simple, conceptual forward analysis procedure for\ninfinity-complete WSTS S. This computes the so-called clover of a state. When S\nis the completion of a WSTS X, the clover in S is a finite description of the\ndownward closure of the reachability set. We show that such completions are\ninfinity-complete exactly when X is an omega-2-WSTS, a new robust class of\nWSTS. We show that our procedure terminates in more cases than the generalized\nKarp-Miller procedure on extensions of Petri nets and on lossy channel systems.\nWe characterize the WSTS where our procedure terminates as those that are\nclover-flattable. Finally, we apply this to well-structured counter systems.","authors":["Alain Finkel","Jean Goubault-Larrecq"],"meta":["August 2012Logical Methods in Computer Science 8(3)","DOI:10.2168/LMCS-8(3:28)2012","SourcearXiv"],"references":["243769368_Well_structured_transition_systems_everywhere_Theoretical_Computer_Science","237073699_Continuous_Lattices_and_Domains","225717407_Towards_a_Model-Checker_for_Counter_Systems","225156893_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","269005046_On_Fraisse's_Order_Type_Conjecture","268501754_Parallel_program_schemata","246227505_Foundations_of_BQO_theory","238750539_Bounded_Algol-Like_Languages","231972854_Partial_well-ordering_of_sets_of_vectors","225504721_On_the_Efficient_Computation_of_the_Minimal_Coverability_Set_for_Petri_Nets"]}
