{"id":"234793698_Design_and_Implementation_of_the_UW_Illustrated_Compiler","abstract":"We have implemented an illustrated compiler for a simple block structured language. The compiler graphically displays its control and data structures, and so gives its viewers an intuitive understanding of compiler organization and operation. The illustrations were planned by hand and display information naturally and concisely.","authors":["K. Andrews","R. R. Henry","W. K.
