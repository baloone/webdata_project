{"id":"318657548_Increasing_Route_Availability_in_Internet_of_Vehicles_Using_Ant_Colony_Optimization","abstract":"Smart City, where a large number of self-configurable and intelligent devices communicate with each other, provides a platform for collaborative decision making processes affecting virtually every other device present in the ecosystem. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) forms a major part of thus ecosystem that comprises of mobile vehicles capable of generating, storing and moreover processing the data flowing through the system. The vehicles continuously communicate with each other and with the external environment to collect and process real-time information. This collaboration provides a means to build up optimized routing decisions that may lead to the improvement in overall congestion suffered by the network. In this paper, we apply two optimization algorithms Any Colony and Firefly Optimization, on the real-time data collected from various vehicular sources to provide them optimized and congestion-free routes. Various road parameters have been considered that may affect the selection of a particular route toward the destination. The results of experimental setup, conducted using two open source simulators NS2 and SUMO, have shown a predominant enhancement by reducing the average travelling time of the vehicles in the complete system taken into consideration.","authors":["Nitika Chowdhary","Pankaj Deep Kaur"],"meta":["July 2017Communications in Computer and Information Science","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-5780-9_29","In book: Advanced Informatics for Computing Research (pp.318-331)"],"references":["313195801_Routing_Algorithm_for_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Network_Based_on_Dynamic_Ant_Colony_Optimization","304623628_An_Optimized_Cluster_Based_Routing_Technique_in_VANET_for_Next_Generation_Network","45904853_Firefly_Algorithms_for_Multimodal_Optimization","3418512_Gambardella_LM_Ant_Colony_System_A_cooperative_learning_approach_to_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_IEEE_Tr_Evol_Comp_1_53-66","325681652_Relation_between_vehicle_routing_problems_An_insertion_heuristic_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with_simultaneous_delivery_and_pick-up_applied_to_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with_backhauls","313228902_On_Solving_Periodic_Re-Optimization_Dynamic_Vehicle_Routing_Problems","297597871_DIVERT_A_Distributed_Vehicular_Traffic_Re-routing_System_for_Congestion_Avoidance","272763021_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows_for_Reducing_Fuel_Consumption","252406459_An_Evaluation_of_Potentials_of_Genetic_Algorithm_in_Shortest_Path_Problem","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","223622530_A_tabu_search_algorithm_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with_simultaneous_pick-up_and_delivery_service","223562829_A_particle_swarm_optimization_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with_simultaneous_pickup_and_delivery","223168172_An_ant_colony_system_ACS_for_vehicle_routing_problem_with_simultaneous_delivery_and_pickup","221018625_Study_on_Method_of_Route_Choice_Problem_Based_on_User_Preference","220301544_Dynamic_route_planning_for_car_navigation_systems_using_virus_genetic_algorithm"]}
