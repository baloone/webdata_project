{"id":"346357752_Quicksom_Self-Organizing_Maps_on_GPUs_for_clustering_of_molecular_dynamics_trajectories","abstract":"We implemented the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm running efficiently on GPUs, and also provide several clustering methods of the resulting maps. We provide scripts and a use case to cluster macro-molecular conformations generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.\n\nAvailability and Implementation\nThe method is available on GitHub and distributed as a pip package.\n\nContact\nguillaume.bouvier@pasteur.fr","authors":["Vincent Mallet","Michael Nilges","Guillaume Bouvier"],"meta":["November 2020Bioinformatics 37(14)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa925"],"references":["336823624_BitClust_Fast_Geometrical_Clustering_of_Long_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations","281792288_CHARMM_The_biomolecular_simulation_program","273955106_An_automatic_tool_to_analyze_and_cluster_macromolecular_conformations_based_on_Self-Organizing_Maps","24429804_CHARMM_The_biomolecular_simulation_program","334325564_Dynamic_graphical_models_of_molecular_kinetics","226370746_Kohonen_T_Self-Organized_Formation_of_Topologically_Correct_Feature_Maps_Biological_Cybernetics_431_59-69","221669764_Self-organised_formation_of_topologically_correct_feature_map","26809702_How_Does_a_Simplified-Sequence_Protein_Fold"]}
