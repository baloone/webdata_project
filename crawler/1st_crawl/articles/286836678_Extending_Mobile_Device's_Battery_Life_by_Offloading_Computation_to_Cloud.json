{"id":"286836678_Extending_Mobile_Device's_Battery_Life_by_Offloading_Computation_to_Cloud","abstract":"The need for increased performance of mobile device directly conflicts with the desire for longer battery life. Offloading computation to resourceful servers is an effective method to reduce energy consumption and enhance performance for mobile applications. Android provides mechanisms for creating mobile applications but lacks a native scheduling system for determining where code should be executed. This paper presents Jade, a system that adds sophisticated energy-aware computation offloading capabilities to Android applications. Jade monitors device and application status and automatically decides where code should be executed. Jade dynamically adjusts offloading strategy by adapting to workload variation, communication costs, and device status.","authors":["Hao Qian","Daniel Andresen"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1109/MobileSoft.2015.39","Conference: 2nd ACM International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems (MOBILESoft 2015)"],"references":["265784999_Jade_An_efficient_energy-aware_computation_offloading_system_with_heterogeneous_network_interface_bonding_for_ad-hoc_networked_mobile_devices","221234509_MAUI_Making_smartphones_last_longer_with_code_offload","221351797_CloneCloud_Elastic_execution_between_mobile_device_and_cloud"]}
