{"id":"256330843_Preattentive_mechanisms_of_change_detection_in_early_auditory_cortex_A_7Tesla_fMRI_study","abstract":"The auditory system continuously monitors the environment for irregularities in an automatic, preattentive fashion. This is presumably accomplished by two mechanisms: a sensory mechanism detects a deviant sound on the basis of differential refractoriness of neural populations sensitive to the standard and deviant sounds, whereas the cognitive mechanism reveals deviance by comparing incoming auditory information with a template derived from previous input. Using fast event-related high resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla we show that both mechanisms can be mapped to different parts of the auditory cortex both at the group level and the single subject level. The sensory mechanism is supported by primary auditory areas in Heschl's gyrus whereas the cognitive mechanism is implemented in more anterior secondary auditory areas. Both mechanisms are equally engaged by simple sine-wave tones and speech-related phonemes indicating that streams of speech and non-speech stimuli are processed in a similar fashion.","authors":["Gregor R Szycik","Jörg Stadler","André Brechmann","Thomas F Münte"],"meta":["August 2013Neuroscience 253","DOI:10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.08.039","SourcePubMed"],"references":["250925562_The_role_of_auditory_transient_and_deviance_processing_in_distraction_of_task_performance_A_combined_behavioral_and_event-related_brain_potential_study","23966321_PyMVPA_A_Python_toolbox_for_multivariate_pattern_analysis_of_fMRI_data","20340721_Pantev_C_Hoke_M_Lutkenhoner_B_Lehnertz_K_Tonotopic_organization_of_the_auditory_cortex_pitch_versus_frequency_representation_Science_246_486-488","16118822_Tono-topic_organization_of_human_auditory_cortex_Science_2161339-1340","14798118_Topographical_Variation_of_the_Human_Primary_Cortices_Implications_for_Neuroimaging_Brain_Mapping_and_Neurobiology","14448469_Boynton_GM_Engel_SA_Glover_GH_Heeger_DJLinear_systems_analysis_of_functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging_in_human_V1_J_Neurosci_164207-4221","11458496_Phonetic_Perception_and_the_Temporal_Cortex","8606948_Human_posterior_auditory_cortex_gates_novel_sounds_to_conciousness","8528001_Automatic_Auditory_Processing_of_English_Words_as_Indexed_by_the_Mismatch_Negativity_Using_a_Multiple_Deviant_Paradigm","8177939_Multiple_Time_Scales_of_Adaptation_in_Auditory_Cortex_Neurons","5659019_Sensory_and_cognitive_mechanisms_of_change_detection_in_the_context_of_speech","234926568_Electrodynamic_headphones_and_woofers_for_application_in_magnetic_resonance_imaging_scanners","232812330_Involuntary_attentional_capture_by_speech_and_non-speech_deviations_A_combined_behavioral-event-related_potential_study","232497361_The_role_of_attention_in_auditory_information_processing_as_revealed_by_event-related_potentials_and_other_brain_measures_of_cognitive_function","227343213_Right_and_Left_Perisylvian_Cortex_and_Left_Inferior_Frontal_Cortex_Mediate_Sentence-Level_Rhyme_Detection_in_Spoken_Language_as_Revealed_by_Sparse_fMRI","223313282_Do_N1MMN_P3a_and_RON_form_a_strongly_coupled_chain_reflecting_the_three_stages_of_auditory_distraction","222558321_'Primitive_Intelligence'_in_the_auditory_cortex","51226424_Neurofunctional_and_Behavioral_Correlates_of_Phonetic_and_Temporal_Categorization_in_Musically_Trained_and_Untrained_Subjects","24182036_Pre-attentive_Spectro-temporal_Feature_Processing_in_the_Human_Auditory_System","23401882_Comparator_and_Non-Comparator_Mechanisms_of_Change_Detection_in_the_Context_of_Speech-_an_ERP_Study","22456017_The_NI_effect_of_selective_attention_reinterpreted","14102547_Mismatch_response_to_changes_in_sound_location","14044218_On_the_detection_of_auditory_deviations_A_pre-attentive_activation_model","11458506_Thresholding_of_Statistical_Maps_in_Functional_Neuroimaging_Using_the_False_Discovery_Rate","10843116_Processing_of_low-probability_sounds_by_cortical_neurons","10746828_The_fate_of_sounds_in_conductors'_brains_An_ERP_study","10644482_Auditory_distraction_by_duration_and_location_deviants_A_behavioral_and_event-related_potential_study","10582776_Potential_Contamination_Effects_of_Neuronal_Refractoriness_on_the_Speech-evoked_Mismatch_Negativity_Response","8195883_Evidence_for_rapid_auditory_perception_as_the_foundation_of_speech_processing_A_sparse_temporal_sampling_fMRI_study","8059352_Sensory_and_cognitive_mechanisms_for_preattentive_change_detection_in_auditory_cortex","7885916_Predicting_the_orientation_of_invisible_stimuli_from_activity_in_human_primary_visual_cortex","6971207_Language_outside_the_focus_of_attention_The_mismatch_negativity_as_a_tool_for_studying_higher_cognitive_processes","6487093_Silent_and_continuous_fMRI_scanning_differentially_modulate_activation_in_an_auditory_language_comprehension_task","6240506_Localizing_pre-attentive_auditory_memory-based_comparison_Magnetic_mismatch_negativity_to_pitch_change","5962018_A_novel_approach_to_study_audiovisual_integration_in_speech_perception_Localizer_fMRI_and_sparse_sampling","5913202_Naatanen_R_Paavilainen_P_Rinne_T_Alho_K_The_mismatch_negativity_MMN_in_basic_research_of_central_auditory_processing_a_review_Clin_Neurophysiol_118_2544-2590"]}
