First, the proposed method labels depth holes based on 8-connectivity. For each labeled depth hole, the proposed method fills depth hole using the depth distribution of neighboring pixels of the depth hole. Then, we refine the hole filling result with cross-bilateral filtering. In experiments, by simply using the depth distribution of neighboring pixels, the proposed method improves the acquired depth map and reduces false filling caused by incorrect depth-color fusion.","authors":["Na-Eun Yang","Yong-Gon Kim","Rae-Hong Park"],"meta":["August 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICSPCC.2012.6335696","Conference: Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on"],"references":["252009852_Temporal_filtering_for_depth_maps_generated_by_Kinect_depth_camera","234777596_Depth_image-based_rendering_from_multiple_cameras_with_3D_propagation_algorithm","224176730_Confidence_evaluation_for_robust_fast-converging_disparity_map_refinement","224173506_Reliability_Fusion_of_Time-of-Flight_Depth_and_Stereo_Geometry_for_High_Quality_Depth_Maps","4119521_A_Time-Of-Flight_Depth_Sensor_-_System_Description_Issues_and_Solutions"]}
