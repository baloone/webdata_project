{"id":"255981731_Boundary_dynamics_a_conceptual_framework","abstract":"Develops a conceptual foundation for the investigation of ecosystem patterns and processes that explicitly considers the spatial patchiness of ecological landscapes. Emphasis is on 'boundary dynamics' - the factors determining the location of boundaries between patch types in a landscape mosaic, how boundaries affect ecological processes and the movement of materials over an area, and how imbalances in these transfers in space can affect boundary characteristics and landscape configuration. Other things being equal, the edaphic patterns of a landscape will determine the spatial patterning of the biota in the system, primarily through their effects on vegetation. Both abiotic and biotic vectors may create disturbances through their actions, which in turn may alter patch boundary locations. Vectors also contribute directly to movements of materials, energy, or organisms over the landscape, both within and between patches, and thereby may determine the spatial patterns of the spread of perturbations through the system.-from Authors","authors":["John Wiens","Clifford S.
