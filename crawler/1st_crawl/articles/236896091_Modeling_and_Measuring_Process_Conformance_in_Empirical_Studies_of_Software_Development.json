{"id":"236896091_Modeling_and_Measuring_Process_Conformance_in_Empirical_Studies_of_Software_Development","abstract":"Process conformance indicates the relationship between the software process as it is actually carried out, and the process as described by a process model. The concept of process conformance is important in various situations within software development, software process improvement, and empirical studies of software development. No matter what the situation is, a clear and accurate understanding of the development process, represented by a process model, is important. Previous work in the area of process conformance has been focused on process models that are represented in a way permitting automated execution, thereby allowing measurement of process conformance by simulating the process model, and comparing the simulation to the actual execution of the process. However, in empirical studies in particular, the process model is often small, simple, and not executable. Thus, a different approach is needed to assess process conformance. A parametrized model representing process conformance as a deviation vector is suggested, thus allowing for measurement of conformance. The proposed model and measurement have been validated by means of a controlled experiment. The experiment suggests that the proposed model and measurement may offer assistance in assessing process conformance in empirical studies of software development.","authors":["S Sørumgård"],"meta":["January 2000","Conference: 9th Nordic Workshop on Programming and Software Development Environment Research"],"references":[]}
