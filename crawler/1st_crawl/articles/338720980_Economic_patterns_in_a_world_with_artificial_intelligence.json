{"id":"338720980_Economic_patterns_in_a_world_with_artificial_intelligence","abstract":"This article outlines relevant economic patterns in a world with artificial intelligence (AI). Five specific economic patterns influenced by AI are discussed: (1) following in the footsteps of ‘homo economicus’ a new type of agent, ‘machina economica’, enters the stage of the global economy. (2) The pattern of division of labor and specialization is further accelerated by AI-induced micro-division of labor. (3) The introduction of AI leads to triangular agency relationships and next level information asymmetries. (4) Data and AI-based machine labor have to be understood as new factors of production. (5) The economics of AI networks can lead to market dominance and unwanted external effects. The analytical perspective is rooted in institutional economics and serves to integrate findings from relevant disciplines in economics and computer science. It is based on the research proposition that ‘institutional matters’ are of high relevance also in a world with AI but that AI gives a new meaning to these matters. The discussion unveils a reinforcing interdependence of the patterns portrayed and points to required research.","authors":["Dirk Nicolas Wagner"],"meta":["January 2020Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review 17(315)","DOI:10.1007/s40844-019-00157-x","Project: The Economics of Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["334086134_Weapons_of_Math_Destruction_How_Big_Data_Increases_Inequality_and_Threatens_Democracy","328056636_Artificial_Intelligence_Evolution_On_the_Virtue_of_Killing_in_the_Artificial_Age","327535041_Software-Agents_and_Liberal_Order_An_Inquiry_along_the_Borderline_between_Economics_and_Computer_Science","330818746_How_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Machine_Learning_May_Eventually_Change_Content_Creation_Methodologies","330325934_The_Atlas_of_Economic_Complexity_Mapping_Paths_to_Prosperity","330052042_AI_and_the_Economy","330045683_The_Economics_of_Artificial_Intelligence_An_Agenda","329648617_Growing_Artificial_Societies_Social_Science_from_the_Bottom_Up","326909746_Use_and_Abuse_of_Network_Effects","326202363_Towards_Consumer-Empowering_Artificial_Intelligence"]}
