{"id":"277334568_Adaptive_Thermostats_for_Noisy_Gradient_Systems","abstract":"We study numerical methods for sampling probability measures in high\ndimensions where the underlying model is only approximately identified with a\ngradient system. Extended stochastic dynamical methods are discussed which have\napplication to multiscale models, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and\nBayesian sampling techniques arising in emerging machine learning applications.\nIn addition to providing a more comprehensive discussion of the foundations of\nthese methods, we propose a new numerical method for the Adaptive\nLangevin/stochastic gradient Nos\\'e-Hoover thermostat that achieves a dramatic\nimprovement in numerical efficiency over the most popular stochastic gradient\nmethods reported in the literature. We also demonstrate that the\nnewly-established method inherits a superconvergence property (fourth order\nconvergence to the invariant measure for configurational quantities) recently\ndemonstrated in the setting of Langevin dynamics. Our findings are verified by\nnumerical experiments.","authors":["Ben Leimkuhler","Xiaocheng Shang"],"meta":["May 2015SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 38(2)","DOI:10.1137/15M102318X","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269692923_Bayesian_Sampling_Using_Stochastic_Gradient_Thermostats","265852668_The_adaptive_buffered_force_QMMM_method_in_the_CP2K_and_AMBER_software_packages","330311648_Handbook_of_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","286123372_Stochastic_gradient_Riemannian_Langevin_dynamics_on_the_probability_simplex","278694516_Numerical_Solution_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","277070078_Thermostats_for_slow_configurational_modes","273603248_High_Order_Numerical_Approximation_of_the_Invariant_Measure_of_Ergodic_SDEs","273354829_Long_Time_Accuracy_of_Lie--Trotter_Splitting_Methods_for_Langevin_Dynamics","270454388_Non-_asymptotic_properties_of_Stochastic_Gradient_Langevin_Dynamics","268209561_M_Carlo_Statistical_Methods"]}
