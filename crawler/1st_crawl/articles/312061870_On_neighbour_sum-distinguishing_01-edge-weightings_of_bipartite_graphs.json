{"id":"312061870_On_neighbour_sum-distinguishing_01-edge-weightings_of_bipartite_graphs","abstract":"Let $S$ be a set of integers. A graph G is said to have the S-property if there exists an S-edge-weighting $w : E(G) \\rightarrow S$ such that any two adjacent vertices have different sums of incident edge-weights. In this paper we characterise all bridgeless bipartite graphs and all trees without the $\\{0,1\\}$-property. In particular this problem belongs to P for these graphs while it is NP-complete for all graphs.","authors":["Kasper Szabo Lyngsie"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":["233730705_The_1-2-3_Conjecture_and_related_problems_a_survey","305821210_The_3-flow_conjecture_factors_modulo_k_and_the_1-2-3-conjecture","247153065_Vertex-Coloring_Edge-Weighting_of_Bipartite_Graphs_with_Two_Edge_Weights","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","220200541_On_the_complexity_of_vertex-coloring_edge-weightings"]}
