{"id":"322880722_Game_Theory_for_Computer_Games_Design","abstract":"Designing and developing computer games can be a complex activity that may involve professionals from a variety of disciplines. In this article, we examine the use of game theory for supporting the design of gameplay within the different sections of a computer game and demonstrate its application in practice via adapted high-level decision trees for modeling the flow in gameplay and payoff matrices for modeling skill or challenge levels.","authors":["Mark Taylor","Mike Baskett","Denis Reilly","Somasundaram Ravindran"],"meta":["November 2017Games and Culture 14(7-8):155541201774049","DOI:10.1177/1555412017740497"],"references":["345395508_Computing_Game_Design_with_Automata_Theory","267391954_Object-oriented_Formal_Development","228884866_MDA_A_Formal_Approach_to_Game_Design_and_Game_Research","225164246_Engaging_by_design_How_engagement_strategies_in_popular_computer_and_video_games_can_inform_instructional_design","222572825_A_documental_approach_to_adventure_game_development","305263055_Development_of_an_Object-Oriented_DBMS","304671895_The_Game_Definition_Game_A_Review","296484090_Design_and_Implementation_of_the_Game-Design_and_Learning_Program","285535771_A_Learner-Centred_Game-Design_Approach_Impacts_on_teachers'_creativity","273947104_Game_Design_Workshop_A_Playcentric_Approach_to_Creating_Innovative_Games","272139836_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Systems_Approach","256971110_Skills_for_creativity_in_games_design","254005978_The_micro-rhetorics_of_Game-O-Matic","248159752_Tricks_of_the_Windows_Game_Programming_Gurus","246284389_Game_Architecture_and_Design","243767525_Game_AI_The_State_of_the_Industry","240013464_Game_Theory_A_Nontechnical_Introduction","234815727_Computer_game-flow_design","233822853_The_Theory_of_Games_and_Economic_Behavior","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","230641900_Engagement_in_digital_entertainment_games_A_systematic_review","224180102_LUDOCORE_A_logical_game_engine_for_modeling_videogames","223010323_Software_engineering_research_for_computer_games_A_systematic_review","222577820_Evaluation_of_object-oriented_design_patterns_in_game_development","220978442_Simulating_Mechanics_to_Study_Emergence_in_Games","220392061_GUIDE_Games_with_UML_for_interactive_design_exploration"]}
