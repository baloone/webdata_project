{"id":"319447254_BNO_An_ontology_for_describing_the_behaviour_of_complex_biomolecular_networks","abstract":"The use of semantic technologies, such as ontologies, to describe and analyse biological systems is at the heart of systems biology. Indeed, understanding the behaviour of cells requires a large amount of context information. In this paper, we propose an ontology entitled ”Biomolecular Network ontology” using the OWL language. The BNO ontology standardises the terminology used by biologists experts to address issues including semantic behaviour representation, reasoning and knowledge sharing. The main benefit of this proposed ontology is the ability to reason about dynamical behaviour of complex biomolecular networks over time. We demonstrate our proposed ontology with a detailed example, the bacteriophage T4 gene 32 use case.","authors":["Ali Ayadi","Cecilia Zanni-Merk","François De Bertrand de Beuvron","Saoussen Krichen"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Computer Science 112:524-533","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.159","Project: Semantic technologies for the optimization of complex biomolecular networks"],"references":["307911642_Logical_and_Semantic_Modeling_of_Complex_Biomolecular_Networks","289366384_Diffany_An_ontology-driven_framework_to_infer_visualise_and_analyse_differential_molecular_networks","267738617_Disease_Ontology_2015_update_An_expanded_and_updated_database_of_Human_diseases_for_linking_biomedical_knowledge_through_disease_data","264126073_Biomolecular_Networks_and_Human_Diseases","261920689_Transittability_of_complex_networks_and_its_applications_to_regulatory_biomolecular_networks","261800573_The_Cell_Behavior_Ontology_Describing_the_intrinsic_biological_behaviors_of_real_and_model_cells_seen_as_active_agents","258224776_SWRL_as_a_Rule_Language_for_Ontology-Based_Models_in_Power_Plant_Design","250307373_CELDA_-_an_ontology_for_the_comprehensive_representation_of_cells_in_complex_systems","47378770_Criteria_and_Evaluation_for_Ontology_Modularization_Techniques","240410049_Web_Ontology_Language_Overview_W3C_Recommendation"]}
