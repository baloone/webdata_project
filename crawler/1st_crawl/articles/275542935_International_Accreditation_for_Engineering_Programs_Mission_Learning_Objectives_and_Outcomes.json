{"id":"275542935_International_Accreditation_for_Engineering_Programs_Mission_Learning_Objectives_and_Outcomes","abstract":"The Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is adopting specific criteria for accrediting engineering programs. It is the responsibility of the institution seeking accreditation of an engineering program to demonstrate clearly that the program meets the following criteria: Students, Program Educational Objectives, Program Outcomes and Assessment, Professional Component, Faculty, Facilities, Institutional Support and Financial Resources, and Program Criteria. This paper outlines the procedures followed in the construction engineering program at the American University in Cairo, to establish Program educational objectives, program outcomes, and courses outcomes to conform to Criteria two and three, Educational Objectives and Program Outcomes. The procedures are based on mapping the university mission and objectives with the Program mission, objectives, and outcomes. The program outcomes are mapped into the courses outcomes that are identified separately for each course.","authors":["A.
