{"id":"42793030_Problem_Frames_Analysing_and_Structuring_Software_Development_Problems","abstract":"It is tempting when approaching a software development problem to rush headlong into the trap of thinking too soon about the solution. Software development problems are about the world outside the computer — the real environment in which the system must have its effect — and demand consideration of the surrounding characteristics, relationships and context. Problem frames are a tool for classifying, analyzing and structuring such software development problems. Whereas object oriented patterns are primarily concerned with solutions, problem frames focus on the problem itself, enabling you to understand and address it clearly and directly.","authors":["Michael Jackson"],"meta":["January 2001"],"references":[]}
