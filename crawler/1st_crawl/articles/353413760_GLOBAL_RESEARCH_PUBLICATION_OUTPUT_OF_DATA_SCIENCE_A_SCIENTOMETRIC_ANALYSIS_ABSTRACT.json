A total of 1345 articles are published worldwide in the field of “Data Science” during 2010-2019. The maximum numbers of articles 525 were published in the year 2019. The publications of articles are gradually increased during the study period. The highest percentage of articles was published in 2019. The relative growth rates for Data Science research is increased to 1.79 in the year 2012. The doubling time for a publication of Data Science in 2019 has increased to 1.41.The highest annual growth rate was 4 in 2012, followed by 1.4 in 2013. English is most preferred language for publishing the articles\ni.e. English 1334. Maximum articles contributed by three Institutions. ie Georgia Institute of technology, Stanford University, University of Calif Berkeley with 26 articles each. Most of the Researchers publish their research in the area of Computer Science, followed by Engineering. Maximum (24) papers are published in Statistical Analysis and Data Mining followed by IEEE Access with 23 articles. Lotsch.J has published maximum number\nof 24 articles, followed by Kalidindi.S.R with 19 articles and Dubey.R, Gunasekaran.A, Ultsc.A with 10 articles each respectively.","authors":["Dr S Kishore Kumar","Shylendra Kumar Basavanna"],"meta":["January 2021International Journal of Library and Information Science 7(1):1-8","Project: SCIENTOMETRIC ANALYSIS"],"references":["348677787_A_scientometric_analysis_of_mobile_technology_publications","344213229_Authorship_Pattern_of_21st_Century_Data_Science_Research_A_Scientometric_Evaluation","333103959_Visualization_and_Scientometric_Mapping_of_Global_Agriculture_Big_Data_Research","327618259_Global_Publications_Output_in_Quantum_Computing_Research_A_Scientometric_Assessment_during_2007-16","256439081_Data_Science_and_Its_Relationship_to_Big_Data_and_Data-Driven_Decision_Making","338965452_Climate_Change_Research_literature_in_India_A_Scientometric_Analysis_during_1991_-_2018"]}
