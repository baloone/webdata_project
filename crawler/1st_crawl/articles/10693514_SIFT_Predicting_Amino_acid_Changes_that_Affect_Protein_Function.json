{"id":"10693514_SIFT_Predicting_Amino_acid_Changes_that_Affect_Protein_Function","abstract":"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies and random mutagenesis projects identify amino acid substitutions in protein-coding\nregions. Each substitution has the potential to affect protein function. SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) is a program that predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function so that users can prioritize\nsubstitutions for further study. We have shown that SIFT can distinguish between functionally neutral and deleterious amino\nacid changes in mutagenesis studies and on human polymorphisms. SIFT is available at http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT.html.","authors":["Pauline C Ng","Steven Henikoff"],"meta":["August 2003Nucleic Acids Research 31(13):3812-4","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkg509","SourcePubMed"],"references":["19635767_Schneider_T_D_Stormo_G_D_Gold_L_Ehrenfeucht_A_Information_content_of_binding_sites_on_nucleotide_sequences_J_Mol_Biol_188_415-431","12709527_Bairoch_A_and_Apweiler_RThe_SWISS-PROT_protein_sequence_database_and_its_supplement_TrEMBL_in_2000_Nucleic_Acids_Res_28_45-48","12204012_dbSNP_the_NCBI_database_of_genetic_variation","11605566_Database_resources_of_the_National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","10782766_Natural_variation_in_human_membrane_transporter_genes_reveals_evolutionary_and_functional_constraints","278323544_Database_resources_of_the_National_Center_for_Biotechnology","229663253_Human_Gene_Mutation_Database-A_biomedical_information_and_research_resource","13920776_Lac_repressor_genetic_map_in_real_space","12101896_Prediction_of_deleterious_human_alleles","12078920_Predicting_the_Functional_Consequences_of_Non-synonymous_Single_Nucleotide_Polymorphisms_Structure-based_Assessment_of_Amino_Acid_Variation","12000560_Predicting_Deleterious_Amino_Acid_Substitutions","11487687_Accounting_for_Human_Polymorphisms_Predicted_to_Affect_Protein_Function","11185388_Human_non-synonymous_SNPs_Server_and_survey","11139351_Evaluation_of_Structural_and_Evolutionary_Contributions_to_Deleterious_Mutation_Prediction"]}
