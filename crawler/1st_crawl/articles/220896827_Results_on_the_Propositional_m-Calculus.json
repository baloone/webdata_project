{"id":"220896827_Results_on_the_Propositional_m-Calculus","abstract":"We define a propositional version of the -calculus, and give an exponential-time decision procedure, small model property, and complete deductive system. We also show that it is strictly more expressive than PDL. Finally, we give an algebraic semantics and prove a representation theorem.","authors":["Dexter Kozen"],"meta":["July 1982DAIMI Report Series 27(3):348-359","DOI:10.1007/BFb0012782","SourceDBLP","Conference: Automata, Languages and Programming, 9th Colloquium, Aarhus, Denmark, July 12-16, 1982, Proceedings"],"references":["221498126_The_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Deterministic_Well-Structured_Programs_Extended_Abstract","312716098_On_induction_vs_-continuity","256554868_An_elementary_proof_of_the_completeness_of_PDL","243547096_A_decidable_mu-calculus","238704775_A_theory_of_programs","232716920_Results_on_the_Propositional_mu-Calculus","232619548_A_decidable_mu-calculus_Preliminary_report","222220406_A_near-optimal_method_for_reasoning_about_action","221591865_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Looping_and_Converse","220897812_A_Calculus_for_Recursive_Program_Schemes","220897611_A_Representation_Theorem_for_Models_of_-Free_PDL","220897186_Characterizing_Correctness_Properties_of_Parallel_Programs_Using_Fixpoints","220896879_Induction_Rules_and_Termination_Proofs","220827100_A_Decision_Procedure_for_the_Propositional_-Calculus","220827095_On_the_Duality_of_Dynamic_Algebras_and_Kripke_Models","220689006_Mathematical_theory_of_program_correctness","220575001_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Regular_Programs","220431245_Alternation","220046675_Recursive_program_schemes_semantics_and_proof_theory","4355244_The_prepositional_dynamic_logic_of_deterministic_well-structured_programs"]}
