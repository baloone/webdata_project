{"id":"275137105_Modal_compact_Hausdorff_spaces","abstract":"We introduce modal compact Hausdorff spaces as generalizations of modal spaces, and show these are coalgebras for the Vietoris\nfunctor on compact Hausdorff spaces. Modal compact regular frames and modal de Vries algebras are introduced as algebraic\ncounterparts of modal compact Hausdorff spaces, and dualities are given for the categories involved. These extend the familiar\nIsbell and de Vries dualities for compact Hausdorff spaces, as well as the duality between modal spaces and modal algebras.\nAs the first step in the logical treatment of modal compact Hausdorff spaces, a version of Sahlqvist correspondence is given\nfor the positive modal language.","authors":["Guram Bezhanishvili","Nick Bezhanishvili","John Harding"],"meta":["January 2012Journal of Logic and Computation 25(1):1-35","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exs030"],"references":["277461360_Priestley_duality_a_Sahlqvist_theorem_and_a_Goldblatt-Thomason_theorem_for_positive_modal_logic","344473293_MacNeille_completions_and_canonical_extensions","324311389_Algebraic_Logic","279957800_6_Algebras_and_coalgebras","268652779_Normierte_Ringe","268247279_Topological_Kripke_models","267015871_Quantifiers_and_equivalence_relations","266433461_On_normed_rings","266225397_Heyting_algebras_I_Duality_theory","265358170_Concrete_representation_of_M-spaces"]}
