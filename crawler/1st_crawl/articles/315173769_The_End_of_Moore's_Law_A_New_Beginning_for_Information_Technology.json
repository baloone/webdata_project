{"id":"315173769_The_End_of_Moore's_Law_A_New_Beginning_for_Information_Technology","abstract":"The insights contained in Gordon Moore's now famous 1965 and 1975 papers have broadly guided the development of semiconductor electronics for over 50 years. However, the field-effect transistor is approaching some physical limits to further miniaturization, and the associated rising costs and reduced return on investment appear to be slowing the pace of development. Far from signaling an end to progress, this gradual \"end of Moore's law\" will open a new era in information technology as the focus of research and development shifts from miniaturization of long-established technologies to the coordinated introduction of new devices, new integration technologies, and new architectures for computing.","authors":["T.N.
