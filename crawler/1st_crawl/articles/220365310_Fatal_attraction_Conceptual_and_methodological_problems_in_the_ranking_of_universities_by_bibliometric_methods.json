Mainly, this scheme is inspired by empirical innovation economics (represented in Germany, e.g., by H. Grupp) and by “advanced bibliometrics' and scientometrics (profiled by van Raan and others). After considering strengths and weaknesses of some of the indicators, possible additional “entry points' for institutions of information delivery are examined, such contributing to an enrichment of existing indicators. And to a “Nationalökonomik des Geistes', requested from librarians in the twenties of the last century by A. von Harnack.","authors":["Ton van Raan"],"meta":["January 2005Scientometrics 62(1):133-143","DOI:10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242916091_International_alignment_and_scientific_regard_as_macro-indicators_for_international_comparisons_of_publications","242916087_'New_Bibliometric_Tools_for_the_Assessment_of_National_Research_Performance_Database_Description_Overview_of_Indicators_and_First_Applications'","242915909_Advanced_Bibliometric_Methods_as_Quantitative_Core_of_Peer_Review_Based_Evaluation_and_Foresight_Exercises","299222200_The_pandora's_box_of_citation_analysis_Measuring_scientific_excellence_-_The_last_evil","284763415_Peer_review_A_view_from_the_inside","259274555_Citation_analysis_The_counting_house","242916046_Comparative_investigation_of_frequency_and_strength_of_motives_toward_referencing_the_reference_threshold_model_-_Comments_on_theories_of_citation","239065530_The_Scientific_Wealth_of_Nations","239061449_The_difficulty_of_achieving_full_coverage_of_international_social_science_literature_and_the_bibliometric_consequences","238832622_Problems_of_Citation_Analysis"]}
