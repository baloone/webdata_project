{"id":"338142438_Coding_over_Sets_for_DNA_Storage","abstract":"In this paper we study error-correcting codes for the storage of data in synthetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). We investigate a storage model where a data set is represented by an unordered set of \n$M$ \nsequences, each of length \n$L$ \n. Errors within that model are a loss of whole sequences and point errors inside the sequences, such as insertions, deletions and substitutions. We derive Gilbert-Varshamov lower bounds and sphere packing upper bounds on achievable cardinalities of error-correcting codes within this storage model. We further propose explicit code constructions than can correct errors in such a storage system that can be encoded and decoded efficiently. Comparing the sizes of these codes to the upper bounds, we show that many of the constructions are close to optimal.","authors":["Andreas Lenz","Paul H.
