{"id":"293809277_Enzymatic_milk_clotting_activity_in_artichoke_Cynara_scolymus_leaves_and_alpine_thistle_Carduus_defloratus_flowers_Immobilization_of_alpine_thistle_aspartic_protease","abstract":"Two different milk clotting enzymes, belonging to the aspartic protease family, were extracted from both artichoke leaves and alpine thistle flowers, and the latter was covalently immobilized by using a polyacrylic support containing polar epoxy groups. Our findings showed that the alpine thistle aspartic protease was successfully immobilized at pH 7.0 on Immunobead IB-150P beads and that, under these experimental conditions, an immobilization yield of about 68% and a recovery of about 54% were obtained. Since the enzyme showed an optimal pH of 5.0, a value very similar to the one generally used for milk clotting during cheese making, and exhibited a satisfactory stability over time, the use of such immobilized vegetable rennet for the production of novel dairy products is suggested.","authors":["Marilena Esposito","Prospero Di Pierro","Winnie Dejonghe","Loredana Mariniello"],"meta":["February 2016Food Chemistry 204","DOI:10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.02.060"],"references":["282254304_Efficient_immobilization_of_Milk_clotting_enzyme_produced_by_Bacillus_sphaericus","267797584_Milk-clotting_activity_of_berries_extracts_from_nine_Solanum_plants","260966611_Statistically_Defining_Optimal_Conditions_of_Coagulation_Time_of_Skim_Milk","236594345_Milk-clotting_activity_of_enzyme_extracts_from_sunflower_and_albizia_seeds_and_specific_hydrolysis_of_bovine_K-casein","234130275_Effect_of_an_enzymatic_complex_from_pineapple_pulp_on_the_primary_clotting_phase","26259528_Multiplicity_of_aspartic_proteinases_from_Cynara_cardunculus_L","285095952_Potential_use_of_vegetable_rennet_in_the_production_of_cheese","260943746_Use_of_artichoke_Cynara_scolymus_flower_extract_as_a_substitute_for_bovine_rennet_in_the_manufacture_of_Gouda-type_cheese_Characterization_of_aspartic_proteases","247238129_Immobilization_of_glucose_oxidase_on_chitosan-SiO_2_gel","230252224_Application_of_Carbohydrases_in_Extracting_Protein_from_Rice_Bran","229866133_Effect_of_a_powdered_vegetable_coagulant_from_Cynara_cardunculus_in_the_accelerated_ripening_of_Manchego_cheese","229110934_Influence_of_vegetable_and_animal_rennet_on_proteolysis_during_ripening_ewes'_milk_cheese","229096129_Characterization_of_aspartic_proteinases_in_C_cardunculus_L_callus_tissue_for_its_prospective_transformation","227793227_Protein_Extraction_from_Heat-stabilized_Defatted_Rice_Bran_II_The_Role_of_Amylase_Celluclast_and_Viscozyme","227734962_Cheesemaking_with_vegetable_coagulants_-_The_use_of_Cynara_L_for_the_production_of_ovine_milk_cheeses","226720260_The_vegetable_rennet_of_Cynara_cardunculus_L_contains_2_proteinases_with_chymosin_and_pepsin-like_specificities","223417287_Characterization_of_the_milk-clotting_properties_of_extracts_from_artichoke_Cynara_scolymus_L_flowers","223082514_Characterisation_of_partially_purified_milk-clotting_enzyme_from_Solanum_dubium_Fresen_seeds","222765171_Behavior_of_glucose_oxidase_immobilized_on_ultrafiltration_membranes_obtained_by_copolymerizing_acrylonitrile_and_N-vinylimidazol","50213465_Ginger_rhizome_as_a_potential_source_of_milk_coagulating_cysteine_protease","19265962_Detection_of_proteases_by_clotting_of_casein_after_gel_electrophoresis","13192670_Use_of_dextrans_as_long_and_hydrophilic_spacer_arms_to_improve_the_performance_of_immobilized_proteins_acting_on_macromolecules","12737121_Preparation_and_Functional_Properties_of_Rice_Bran_Protein_Isolate","11645323_Multifunctional_Epoxy_Supports_A_New_Tool_To_Improve_the_Covalent_Immobilization_of_Proteins_The_Promotion_of_Physical_Adsorptions_of_Proteins_on_the_Supports_before_Their_Covalent_Linkage","11436790_Characterization_of_Lettucine_a_Serine-like_Protease_from_Lactuca_sativa_Leaves_as_a_Novel_Enzyme_for_Milk_Clotting","10783468_Isolation_and_Partial_Characterization_of_Rennet-like_Proteases_from_Australian_Cardoon_Cynara_cardunculus_L","8553424_Structure_and_Function_of_Aspartic_Proteinases","8354720_Immobilization_of_Rennet_from_Mucor_m_iehei_via_Its_Sugar_Chain_Its_Use_in_Milk_Coagulation","8117180_Purification_and_Characterization_of_a_Milk-Clotting_Aspartic_Proteinase_from_Globe_Artichoke_Cynara_scolymus_L","8080920_Purification_of_cynarases_from_artichoke_Cynara_scolymus_L_Enzymatic_properties_of_cynarase_A","7308352_Epoxy-Amino_Groups_A_New_Tool_for_Improved_Immobilization_of_Proteins_by_the_Epoxy_Method"]}
