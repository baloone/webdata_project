{"id":"325533856_International_Journal_of_Advance_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Management_Studies_Improve_the_Quality_of_Multispectral_Bands_using_Different_Fusion_Techniques","abstract":"Image fusion is the process of combining the panchromatic band with the multispectral bands to form a fused image that retains the spatial information from the high resolution panchromatic image and the spectral characteristics of the lower resolution multispectral image. Many techniques such as Local mean, matching, wavelet, PCA, Brovey have been adopted in this research. Spatial and spectral qualities can be evaluated by relying on metric performance data such as (MSE, RMSE, CC ERGAS, RASE). World view-2 satellite images for multispectral and panchromatic image in 2m and 0.5m spatial resolution respectively ware used to perform this research.","authors":["Alyaa Hussein Ali","I Hanaa","Ali","Aseel Amer"],"meta":["June 2018","Project: image processing"],"references":["335830530_Enhancement_and_Quality_Assessment_of_Multi-Spectral_Image_Using_Different_Fusion_Methods","307633426_Image_Fusion_Algorithms_and_Applications","29610623_Fusion_of_satellite_images_of_different_spatial_resolutions_Assessing_the_quality_of_resulting_images","313102316_Extracting_spectral_contrast_in_landsat_thematic_mapper_image_data_using_selective_principal_component_analysis","247936157_Image_Fusion_Theories_Techniques_and_Applications","220632567_Multisensor_Image_Fusion_Using_the_Wavelet_Transform","3203496_Fusion_of_multispectral_and_panchromatic_images_using_improved_IHS_and_PCA_mergers_based_on_wavelet_decomposition"]}
