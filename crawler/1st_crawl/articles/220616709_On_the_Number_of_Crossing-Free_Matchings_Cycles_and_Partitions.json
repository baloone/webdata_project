{"id":"220616709_On_the_Number_of_Crossing-Free_Matchings_Cycles_and_Partitions","abstract":"We show that a set of n points in the plane has at most O(10:05, ) perfect matchings with crossing-free straight-line embedding. The expected number of perfect crossing-free matchings of a set of n points drawn i. i. d. from an arbitrary distribution in the plane is at most O(9:24, ). Several related bounds are derived: (a) The number of all (not necessarily perfect) crossing-free matchings is at most O(10:43, ). (b) The number of left-right perfect crossing-free matchings (where the points are designated as left or as right endpoints of the matching edges) is at most O(5:38, ). (c) The number of perfect crossing-free matchings across a line (where all the matching edges must cross a xed halving line of the set) is at most 4,.","authors":["Micha Sharir","Emo Welzl"],"meta":["January 2006SIAM Journal on Computing 36(3):695-720","DOI:10.1137/050636036","SourceDBLP"],"references":["225189803_Minimum_Weight_Triangulation_by_Cutting_Out_Triangles","220779451_On_the_Number_of_Plane_Graphs","220059815_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Few_Inner_Points","2569749_Counting_Lattice_Triangulations","2504292_The_Maximum_Clique_Problem","2104597_Counting_Lattice_Triangulations","265548375_Crossing-Free_Subgraphs","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","256391832_Optimal_crossing-free_Hamiltonian_circuit_drawings_of_Kn","246936406_New_lower_bounds_for_the_number_of_straight-edge_triangulations_of_a_planar_point_set","242454081_Algorithms_in_Combinatorial_Geometry","238732942_Relations_between_hypersurface_cross_ratios_and_a_combinatorial_formula_for_partitions_of_a_polygon_for_permanent_preponderance_and_for_non-associative_products","238651513_A_lower_bound_on_the_maximum_number_of_crossing-free_Hamilton_cycles_in_a_rectilinear_drawing_of_Kn","227335335_Articulated_mechanism_design_by_graph_theoretical_enumeration","227274621_Note_-_On_the_Number_of_Triangulations_of_Planar_Point_Sets","225574062_Delineating_Boundaries_for_Imprecise_Regions","225528259_A_lower_bound_for_the_optimal_crossing-free_Hamiltonian_cycle_problem","225240759_On_the_Number_of_Simple_Cycles_in_Planar_Graphs","222831268_A_lower_bound_on_the_number_of_triangulations_of_planar_point_sets","222528344_The_traveling_salesman_problem_with_few_inner_points","222497318_Reverse_search_for_enumeration","221942442_A_better_upper_bound_on_the_number_of_triangulations_of_a_planar_point_set","220991540_Encoding_a_triangulation_as_a_permutation_of_its_point_set","220991024_The_point_set_order_type_data_base_A_collection_of_applications_and_results","220983373_Random_triangulations_of_planar_point_sets","220779197_On_the_Number_of_Crossing-Free_Matchings_Cycles_and_Partitions","220620672_Counting_triangulations_of_almost-convex_polygons","220620450_A_Lower_Bound_for_the_Number_of_Polygonizations_of_N_Points_in_the_Plane","220556520_Lower_bounds_on_the_number_of_crossing-free_subgraphs_of_K-N","220453378_Polygonizations_of_Point_Sets_in_the_Plane","220406753_Geometric_Clusterings","34913012_Studies_in_computational_geometry_motivated_by_mesh_generation","30508390_Graphs_Drawn_With_Few_Crossings_Per_Edge","2450356_On_Two_Lower_Bound_Constructions","2104937_An_Upper_Bound_for_the_Number_of_Planar_Lattice_Triangulations"]}
