{"id":"311941259_Novel_Concepts_of_Strongly_Edge_Irregular_m-Polar_Fuzzy_Graphs","abstract":"A graph structure is a useful tool in solving the combinatorial problems in different areas of computer science and computational intelligence systems. In this paper, we present a frame work to handle m-polar fuzzy information by combining the theory of m-polar fuzzy sets with graphs. We introduce the notion of strongly edge irregular and strongly edge totally irregular m-polar fuzzy graphs. Some properties of them are also studied to characterize strongly edge irregular and strongly edge totally irregular m-polar fuzzy graphs.","authors":["Ganesh Ghorai","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["December 2017International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics 3(4):3321-3332","DOI:10.1007/s40819-016-0296-y","Project: Fuzzy graph"],"references":["314375949_Complete_fuzzy_graphs","304526053_Faces_and_dual_of_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","304525757_Some_properties_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","295908728_A_study_on_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","285580973_New_Concepts_of_Vague_Graphs","283088924_Certain_Types_of_Product_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","292143739_Product_of_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_and_their_degree","291629985_Semi_Global_Domination_Sets_in_Vague_Graphs_with_Application","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs"]}
