The aim of this work is to calculate the braking temperature of the brake disc of an aircraft during the landing phase, using a calculation code based on Finite Element Method (FEM) and the analytical method of Newcomb. This investigation uses two kinds of disc — full and real disc (original version mounted on the aircraft) — and three braking disc materials such as the cast irons FG15, FG20 and FG25. The result showed that the numbers of holes and slots existing in the real disc has no influence on the braking temperature compared to the full disc. On the other hand, all brake disc materials have almost the same thermal behavior. Both models, analytical and numerical, provided acceptable results. </jats:p","authors":["M.
