{"id":"278733903_Linear-Time_Sequence_Comparison_Using_Minimal_Absent_Words_Applications","abstract":"Sequence comparison is a prerequisite to virtually all comparative genomic\nanalyses. It is often realised by sequence alignment techniques, which are\ncomputationally expensive. This has led to increased research into alignment\nfree techniques, which are based on measures referring to the composition of\nsequences in terms of their constituent patterns. These measures, such as\n$q$-gram distance, can usually be computed in time linear with respect to the\nlength of the sequences. In this article, we focus on the complementary idea:\nhow two sequences can be efficiently compared based on information about what\ndoes not occur in the sequences. In particular, we present a linear-time and\nlinear-space algorithm to compare two sequences by considering all their\nminimal absent words. An absent word is minimal if all its proper factors occur\nin the sequence. In the process, we present some results of combinatorial\ninterest, and also extend the proposed techniques to circular sequences.","authors":["Maxime Crochemore","Gabriele Fici","Robert Mercas","Solon P.
