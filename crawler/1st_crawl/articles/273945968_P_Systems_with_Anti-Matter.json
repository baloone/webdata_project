{"id":"273945968_P_Systems_with_Anti-Matter","abstract":"The concept of a matter object being annihilated when meeting its corresponding anti-matter object is investigated in the context of P systems. Computational completeness can be obtained with using only non-cooperative rules besides these matter/anti-matter annihilation rules if these annihilation rules have priority over the other rules. Without this priority condition, in addition catalytic rules with one single catalyst are needed to get computational completeness. Even deterministic systems are obtained in the accepting case. Allowing anti-matter objects as input and/or output, we even get a computationally complete computing model for computations on integer numbers. Interpreting sequences of symbols taken in from and/or sent out to the environment as strings, we get a model for computations on strings, which can even be interpreted as representations of elements of a group based on a computable finite presentation.","authors":["Artiom Alhazov","Bogdan Aman","Rudolf Freund"],"meta":["August 2014Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8961:66-85","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-14370-5_5","Conference: International Conference on Membrane Computing"],"references":["256441559_How_to_Obtain_Computational_Completeness_in_P_Systems_with_One_Catalyst","255578552_Spiking_Neural_P_Systems_with_Anti-Spikes","225871428_Static_Sorting_P_Systems","45099799_Spiking_Neural_P_Systems_with_Weights","31593969_Handbook_of_Formal_Languages","344520881_Regulated_Rewriting_in_Formal_Language_Theory","279292707_Catalytic_and_Purely_Catalytic_P_Systems_and_P_Automata_Control_Mechanisms_for_Obtaining_Computational_Completeness","273945901_Antimatter_as_a_Frontier_of_Tractability_in_Membrane_Computing","268609752_Membrane_Computing_An_Introduction","268054690_Regulated_rewriting_in_formel_language_theory","267676087_Matter_and_Anti-Matter_in_Membrane_Systems","265780179_Handbook_of_Computational_Group_Theory","238719555_Membrane_Computing_10th_International_Workshop_WMC_2009_Curtea_de_Arges_Romania_August_24-27_2009_Revised_Selected_and_Invited_Papers","234807858_Computation_Finite_and_Infinite_Machines","234780369_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Membrane_Computing","223827187_Computing_with_membranes_J_Comput_Syst_Sci","222883184_Small_Universal_Register_Machines","222397668_Computationally_universal_P_systems_without_priorities_Two_catalysts_are_sufficient","221467408_A_Small_Universal_Antiport_P_System_with_Forbidden_Context","221320308_P_Automata_or_Purely_Communicating_Accepting_P_Systems","220520735_Event-Related_Outputs_of_Computations_in_P_Systems","220118341_A_quick_introduction_to_membrane_computing","2627340_Computing_with_Membranes_A_Variant"]}
