{"id":"324820733_Effective_android_malware_detection_with_a_hybrid_model_based_on_deep_autoencoder_and_convolutional_neural_network","abstract":"Android security incidents occurred frequently in recent years. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of large-scale Android malware detection, in this work, we propose a hybrid model based on deep autoencoder (DAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN). First, to improve the accuracy of malware detection, we reconstruct the high-dimensional features of Android applications (apps) and employ multiple CNN to detect Android malware. In the serial convolutional neural network architecture (CNN-S), we use Relu, a non-linear function, as the activation function to increase sparseness and “dropout” to prevent over-fitting. The convolutional layer and pooling layer are combined with the full-connection layer to enhance feature extraction capability. Under these conditions, CNN-S shows powerful ability in feature extraction and malware detection. Second, to reduce the training time, we use deep autoencoder as a pre-training method of CNN. With the combination, deep autoencoder and CNN model (DAE-CNN) can learn more flexible patterns in a short time. We conduct experiments on 10,000 benign apps and 13,000 malicious apps. CNN-S demonstrates a significant improvement compared with traditional machine learning methods in Android malware detection. In details, compared with SVM, the accuracy with the CNN-S model is improved by 5%, while the training time using DAE-CNN model is reduced by 83% compared with CNN-S model.","authors":["Wei Wang","Mengxue Zhao","Jigang Wang"],"meta":["August 2019Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing 10(1):1-9","DOI:10.1007/s12652-018-0803-6"],"references":["321262842_Cognitive_Multiuser_Energy_Harvesting_Decode-and-Forward_Relaying_System_With_Direct_Links","322905796_A_new_dynamic_firefly_algorithm_for_demand_estimation_of_water_resources","322608214_Transportation_Spherical_Watermarking","322406510_Cloud-Aided_Lightweight_Certificateless_Authentication_Protocol_With_Anonymity_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","321648643_Performance_Evaluation_of_Implicit_Smartphones_Authentication_via_Sensor-behavior_Analysis","321114661_Anonymous_and_Traceable_Group_Data_Sharing_in_Cloud_Computing","320954155_Pattern-Growth_Based_Mining_Mouse-Interaction_Behavior_for_an_Active_User_Authentication_System","320827687_Reservoir_Computing_Meets_Smart_Grids_Attack_Detection_Using_Delayed_Feedback_Networks","320449428_Distance_Metric_Optimization_Driven_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Age_Invariant_Face_Recognition","319770387_Deep_Sparse_Rectifier_Neural_Networks"]}
