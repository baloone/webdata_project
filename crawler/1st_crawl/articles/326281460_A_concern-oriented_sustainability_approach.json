{"id":"326281460_A_concern-oriented_sustainability_approach","abstract":"Sustainability and sustainable development has become a concern worldwide, hence introduced in roadmaps and strategies of public and private organizations. This trend has not been neglected by the computer science community, who is increasingly considering sustainability as a first class entity in software development. To properly address sustainability, its various dimensions need to be reasoned about and their impact on each other and on other system concerns studied from the very early stages of software development. To this purpose, we present a concern-oriented requirements approach that allows both, modeling sustainability concepts and their relationships, and managing conflicting situations triggered by impacts among sustainability dimensions or between those and other system concerns. To tackle the complexity of conflict management, a\nrigorous trade-off analysis technique based on multi-criteria decision making methods is used to rank, stakeholders and effects between concerns’ responsibilies.We use a real project to validate our proposal, discuss the results obtained and synthesize major points that require further research.","authors":["Isabel Sofia Brito","José María Conejero Manzano","Ana Moreira","João Araújo"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1109/RCIS.2018.8406676","Conference: 2018 12th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)"],"references":["321702577_Characterizing_the_Contribution_of_Quality_Requirements_to_Software_Sustainability","308868573_Sustainability_Design_and_Software_The_Karlskrona_Manifesto","303617265_Software_Sustainability_The_Modern_Tower_of_Babel","283855714_Goal_Modeling_for_Sustainability_The_Case_of_Time","282796167_Safety_vs_sustainability_design_Analogies_differences_and_potential_synergies","281558264_Evidencing_Sustainability_Design_through_Examples","281299114_Modeling_for_Sustainability","276336037_Challenges_and_Opportunities_for_Sustainable_Software","266658756_Systematic_mapping_Study_on_Software_Engineering_for_Sustainability_SE4S","264239621_The_Blind_Men_and_the_Elephant_Towards_an_Empirical_Evaluation_Framework_for_Software_Sustainability","255949688_A_Generic_Model_for_Sustainability_with_Process-_and_Product-specific_Instances","244418848_Aspect-Oriented_Requirements_with_UML","221555086_Integrating_Sustainability_in_Decision-Making_Processes_A_Modelling_Strategy","220116586_Handling_Conflicts_in_Aspectual_Requirements_Compositions","209805531_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_Methods_A_Comparative_Study","319437609_Products_go_Green_Worst-Case_Energy_Consumption_in_Software_Product_Lines","317449119_Sustainability_Environmental_economic_and_social","313716759_Modelling_strategic_relationships_for_process_reengineering","312486019_Modeling_the_Impact_of_UAVs_in_Sustainability","309743906_Incorporating_Sustainability_Design_in_Requirements_Engineering_Process_A_Preliminary_Study","309282726_Sustainability_Human_Social_Economic_and_Environmental","303413164_Modeling_for_sustainability","289765589_Quality_in_use_and_software_greenability","289102867_A_metamodel_for_aspect-oriented_analysis_approach","283754563_Requirements_The_Key_to_Sustainability","281884822_Model_Driven_Engineering_Principles_Scope_Deployment_and_Applicability","281443522_Integrating_Environmental_Sustainability_in_Software_Product_Quality","265780327_Non-Functional_Requirements_in_Software_Engineering","261096366_Sustainability_requirement_patterns","251721760_The_GREENSOFT_Model_A_reference_model_for_green_and_sustainable_software_and_its_engineering","247922585_The_KAOS_Project_Knowledge_acquisition_in_automated_specifications_of_software","224260085_Toward_sustainable_software_engineering_NIER_track","222652328_A_comparative_study_of_the_numerical_scales_and_the_prioritization_methods_in_AHP","220691935_Designing_Object-Oriented_Software","220197167_Hybrid_assessment_method_for_software_engineering_decisions"]}
