{"id":"248965935_Introducing_Students_to_Self-assessment","abstract":"This study describes the introduction of self‐assessment to third‐year education students as a strategy for improving learning. Students were required to self‐assess a literature review using the marking guide developed by the course lecturer. The results showed a good level of agreement between students and the teacher but with a tendency for more students to overestimate than underestimate their grades. Interviews with students indicated that those who over estimated their grades were less clear about the standard by which to judge their work and looked for more specific guidance on what the lecturer ‘wanted’ than students whose estimates were closer to the lecturer's. The former group also tended to include ‘effort’ as a factor in their judgement. Students who responded more positively to the self‐assessment exercise were also more positive about the value of having a marking guide given out with the assignment. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving the study and some advice to other teachers who are contemplating the introduction of self‐assessment.","authors":["Keith Sullivan","Cedric Hall"],"meta":["September 1997Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education 22(3):289-305","DOI:10.1080/0260293970220303"],"references":["254219847_The_role_of_self-assessment_in_student_grading","288941461_Implementing_student_self_assessment","227262998_Quantitative_studies_of_student_self-assessment_in_higher_education_A_critical_analysis_of_findings"]}
