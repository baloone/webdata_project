{"id":"2451438_March_1996Teaching_Human_Computer_Interaction_to_Programmers","abstract":". Many computer science graduates will likely find themselves developing interfaces in a work culture that has only nave notions of usability engineering. This article describes a course I developed that prepares students for this eventuality by providing them with practical and applicable HCI skills. All course material is available on the world wide web, and pointers are provided. The Challenge. A recent phenomena in the computer industry is the expectation that everyday programmers, such as those working in small firms producing in-house software, will design good interfaces as well as good code. Unfortunately most programmers are sadly unprepared for this job. Their traditional computer science training rarely included HCI, either because courses were unavailable in their educational program, or because such a course was considered esoteric and for specialists. This, of course, is changing. Because of job demands, many computer science students now consider HCI a core skill as m...","authors":["Saul Greenberg"],"meta":["June 1998interactions 3(4)","DOI:10.1145/226650.226651"],"references":["316858471_ACM_SIGCHI_Curricula_for_Human-Computer_Interaction","242375192_Usability_engineering_at_a_discount","229068216_Readings_in_human-computer_interaction_towards_year_2000","220691659_Usability_Engineering"]}
