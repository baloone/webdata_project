{"id":"346719980_Artificial_intelligence_and_the_limits_of_legal_personality","abstract":"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more sophisticated and play a larger role in society, arguments that they should have some form of legal personality gain credence. The arguments are typically framed in instrumental terms, with comparisons to juridical persons such as corporations. Implicit in those arguments, or explicit in their illustrations and examples, is the idea that as AI systems approach the point of indistinguishability from humans they should be entitled to a status comparable to natural persons. This article contends that although most legal systems could create a novel category of legal persons, such arguments are insufficient to show that they should.","authors":["Simon Chesterman"],"meta":["October 2020International and Comparative Law Quarterly 69(4):819-844","DOI:10.1017/S0020589320000366"],"references":["346380777_Towards_a_Theory_of_Legal_Animal_Rights_Simple_and_Fundamental_Rights","337415264_Robots_Healthcare_and_the_Law_Regulating_Automation_in_Personal_Care","335898978_Who_or_What_Can_be_a_Legal_Person","334172648_Artificial_Intelligence_Does_Consciousness_Matter","342241265_Artificial_Inventors","342175166_A_Commentary_on_the_International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights_The_UN_Human_Rights_Committee's_Monitoring_of_ICCPR_Rights","337894137_Beijing_Internet_Court_denies_copyright_to_works_created_solely_by_artificial_intelligence","336897555_Climate_Change_and_the_Voiceless_Protecting_Future_Generations_Wildlife_and_Natural_Resources","336079111_Contemporary_Intellectual_Property_Law_and_PolicyLaw_and_Policy","336054949_Artificial_Intelligence_and_the_Problem_of_Autonomy"]}
