{"id":"225722154_A_Polynomial_Bound_for_Untangling_Geometric_Planar_Graphs","abstract":"To untangle a geometric graph means to move some of the vertices so that the resulting geometric graph has no crossings. Pach and Tardos (Discrete Comput. Geom. 28(4): 585–592, 2002) asked if every n-vertex geometric planar graph can be untangled while keeping at least n\nε\nvertices fixed. We answer this question in the affirmative with ε=1/4. The previous best known bound was\n\\(\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log\\log n})\\)\n. We also consider untangling geometric trees. It is known that every n-vertex geometric tree can be untangled while keeping at least\n\\(\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})\\)\nvertices fixed, while the best upper bound was\n\\(\\mathcal{O}((n\\log n)^{2/3})\\)\n. We answer a question of Spillner and Wolff (http:// arxiv. org/ abs/ 0709. 0170) by closing this gap for untangling trees. In particular, we show that for infinitely many values of n, there is an n-vertex geometric tree that cannot be untangled while keeping more than\n\\(3(\\sqrt{n}-1)\\)\nvertices fixed.","authors":["Prosenjit Bose","Vida Dujmović","Ferran Hurtado","Stefan Langerman"],"meta":["October 2009Discrete & Computational Geometry 42(4):570-585","DOI:10.1007/s00454-008-9125-3","SourceOAI"],"references":["277860442_Tolerancia_de_Estructuras_Geometricas_y_Combinatorias","221557214_Moving_Vertices_to_Make_Drawings_Plane","220752877_Convex_Drawings_of_Graphs_with_Non-convex_Boundary","220452561_Untangling_a_Planar_Graph","272675777_A_combinatorial_problem_in_geometry","230595915_A_Decomposition_Theorem_for_Partially_Ordered_Sets","226475084_Uber_eine_Eigenschaft_der_Ebenem_Komplexe","225493350_Untangling_a_Planar_Graph","220569860_Convex_drawings_of_graphs_with_non-convex_boundary_constraints","220485121_Obfuscated_Drawings_of_Planar_Graphs"]}
