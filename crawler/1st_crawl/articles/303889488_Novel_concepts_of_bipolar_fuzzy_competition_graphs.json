{"id":"303889488_Novel_concepts_of_bipolar_fuzzy_competition_graphs","abstract":"A fuzzy graph theory is one of the most developing area of research, which has a variety of applications in different fields, including computer science, communication networks, social networks, decision-making and optimization problems. In this research article, we present various methods of construction of bipolar fuzzy competition graphs. We investigate some novel properties of bipolar fuzzy competition graphs. We present an interesting application of bipolar fuzzy competition graphs in politics. We also design an algorithm for computing the strength of competition among political candidates in a local government.","authors":["Musavarah Sarwar","Muhammad Akram"],"meta":["June 2016Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing 54(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s12190-016-1021-z"],"references":["279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","276849270_m-Step_fuzzy_competition_graphs","276464981_Fuzzy_colouring_of_fuzzy_graphs","273176661_Fuzzy_Planar_Graphs","264141795_Comparison_of_Interval-valued_fuzzy_sets_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_bipolar-valued_fuzzy_sets","260712518_Strongest_Strong_Cycles_and_-Fuzzy_Graphs","257435057_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","236943359_Fuzzy_k_-Competition_Graphs_and_p_-Competition_Fuzzy_Graphs","3595993_Bipolar_fuzzy_sets_and_relations_a_computational_framework_for_cognitive_modeling_and_multiagent_decision_analysis","297672639_Additive_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Aggregation_Operators_Based_on_Fuzzy_Measure","288699916_Certain_types_of_irregular_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","288198503_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Competition_Graphs","286315881_Antipodal_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","283901362_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_competition_graphs","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs","257391468_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_with_applications","247520571_Similarity_and_fuzzy_ordering","242794179_Some_remarks_on_fuzzy_graphs","242355438_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Its_Applications","223593669_Zadeh_LA_Similarity_Relations_and_Fuzzy_Orderings_Information_Sciences_3_177-200","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","220354975_Domination_in_products_of_fuzzy_graphs","220314865_Operations_on_Fuzzy_Graphs","220313294_Types_of_arcs_in_a_fuzzy_graph","220311716_Strong_arcs_in_fuzzy-graphs"]}
