{"id":"277912353_Multi-Sensor_Image_Fusion_and_Its_Applications","abstract":"Taking another lesson from nature, the latest advances in image processing technology seek to combine image data from several diverse types of sensors in order to obtain a more accurate view of the scene: very much the same as we rely on our five senses. Multi-Sensor Image Fusion and Its Applications is the first text dedicated to the theory and practice of the registration and fusion of image data, covering such approaches as statistical methods, color-related techniques, model-based methods, and visual information display strategies. After a review of state-of-the-art image fusion techniques, the book provides an overview of fusion algorithms and fusion performance evaluation. The following chapters explore recent progress and practical applications of the proposed techniques to solving problems in such areas as medical diagnosis, surveillance and biometric systems, remote sensing, nondestructive evaluation, blurred image restoration, and image quality assessment. Recognized leaders from industry and academia contribute the chapters, reflecting the latest research trends and providing useful algorithms to aid implementation. Supplying a 28-page full-color insert, Multi-Sensor Image Fusion and Its Applications clearly demonstrates the benefits and possibilities of this revolutionary development. It provides a solid knowledge base for applying these cutting-edge techniques to new challenges and creating future advances.","authors":["Rick S.
