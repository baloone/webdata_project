{"id":"321635819_Semantic_Composition_of_3D_Content_Behavior_for_Explorable_Virtual_Reality_Applications","abstract":"Virtual reality (VR) applications become increasingly popular in various application domains because of the possibilities of realistic immersive presentation and interaction with virtual objects as well as the diversity of advanced, relatively cheap devices. The semantic web, which is an important trend in the current web development, requires effective exploration of content distributed across different applications. Exploration of 3D content, which is the main part of VR applications, is a complex task, as the geometry, structure and appearance of the content may interactively evolve over time. Although a number of solutions are available for implementation of VR applications, the approaches have not been intended for on-demand exploration of behavior-rich 3D content in real time. In this paper, we present the development pipeline of explorable VR applications, which is based on semantic composition of 3D content activities into more complex behavior. The resulting applications are based on Prolog, which is a well-established knowledge representation language, and they can be queried for time-dependent 3D content features using domain-specific concepts. The approach has been implemented using the OpenStage 2 motion capture system and the Unity game engine. It can be used in different application domains and improve the integration of VR with the semantic web.","authors":["Jakub Floty≈Ñski","Marcin Krzyszkowski","Krzysztof Walczak"],"meta":["December 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-72323-5_1","In book: Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (pp.3-23)"],"references":["313947976_Ontology-Based_Representation_and_Modelling_of_Synthetic_3D_Content_A_State-of-the-Art_Review_Ontology-Based_Representation_and_Modelling_of_Synthetic_3D_Content","286427583_On-Demand_Generation_of_3D_Content_Based_on_Semantic_Meta-Scenes","283274793_An_experimental_study_of_spatial_sound_usefulness_in_searching_and_navigating_through_AR_environments","282735562_Building_Contextual_Augmented_Reality_Environments_with_semantics","282160275_My_Corporis_Fabrica_Embryo_An_ontology-based_3D_spatio-temporal_modeling_of_human_embryo_development","281489532_Conceptual_knowledge-based_modeling_of_interactive_3D_content","277675786_Semantic_Representation_of_Multi-platform_3D_Content","275541400_Semantic_Modelling_of_Interactive_3D_Content_with_Domain-specific_Ontologies","265538746_Matching_CAD_Object_Models_in_Semantic_Mapping","260981540_Simulator_X_A_Scalable_and_Concurrent_Software_Platform_for_Intelligent_Realtime_Interactive_Systems","260981484_Enhanced_Decoupling_of_Components_in_Intelligent_Realtime_Interactive_Systems_using_Ontologies","232625844_Coupling_Ontologies_with_Graphics_Content_for_Knowledge_Driven_Visualization","232614759_Towards_a_Semantic_Web_System_for_Understanding_Real_World_Representations","230579016_Knowledge-Based_Representation_Of_3D_Media","228628064_Part-based_annotation_of_virtual_3d_shapes","221466515_ISReal_An_Open_Platform_for_Semantic-Based_3D_Simulations_in_the_3D_Internet","221269532_Conceptual_Modeling_for_Virtual_Reality","221000951_Applying_semantic_web_technology_to_feature_modeling","220989494_On_Generating_Virtual_Worlds_from_Domain_Ontologies","220970054_Using_Ontologies_to_Build_Virtual_Worlds_for_the_Web","220831215_An_Ontology-Driven_Approach_for_Modeling_Behavior_in_Virtual_Environments","220830129_Ontology-Based_Searching_Framework_for_Digital_Shapes","220786051_Semantic_Annotation_of_3D_Surface_Meshes_Based_on_Feature_Characterization","220786047_A_Semantic_Web_Environment_for_Digital_Shapes_Understanding","215619032_Semantic_World_Models_for_Ubiquitous_Augmented_Reality","37446111_An_ontology_of_virtual_humans_IIncorporating_semantics_into_human_shapes","37442585_Emotional_Body_Expression_Parameters_In_Virtual_Human_Ontology","37419022_Semantic_virtual_environments","2942423_Intelligent_Modelling_of_Virtual_Worlds_Using_Domain_Ontologies","2623069_The_Event_Calculus_Explained","317122002_Knowledge-based_representation_of_3D_content_behavior_in_a_service-oriented_virtual_environment","317121965_Semantic_model_for_distributed_augmented_reality_services","314747708_Emotion_Theory_Research_and_Experience","305696735_Customization_of_3D_Content_with_Semantic_Meta-Scenes","300789375_Ontology-Based_Creation_of_3D_Content_in_a_Service-Oriented_Environment","300490330_Semantic_query-based_generation_of_customized_3D_scenes","291183979_A_Logic-Based_Calculus_of_Events","285238886_Semantic_contextual_augmented_reality_environments","268061415_Realizing_Semantic_Virtual_Environments_with_Ontology_and_Pluggable_Procedures","264888906_Conceptual_Modeling_of_Complex_Objects_for_Virtual_Environments_A_Formal_Approach","261237874_Harvesting_of_semantic_metadata_from_distributed_3D_web_content","261155899_Microformat_and_Microdata_schemas_for_interactive_3D_web_content","228642351_The_semantics_of_multi-user_virtual_environments","227087920_The_Role_of_Ontologies_for_3D_Media_Applications","221402614_Simulator_X_A_scalable_and_concurrent_architecture_for_intelligent_realtime_interactive_systems","221276739_Towards_the_Semantics_of_Digital_Shapes_The_AIMSHAPE_Approach","221023040_Semantic_virtual_environments","221011083_Semantic_description_of_3D_environments_A_proposal_based_on_web_standards","220805306_Using_pluggable_procedures_and_ontology_to_realize_semantic_virtual_environments_20","4294772_Part-Based_Annotation_of_Virtual_3D_Shapes"]}
