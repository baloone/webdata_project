{"id":"319638950_Data_analytics_and_visualization_for_inspecting_cancers_and_genes","abstract":"This paper describes our latest research in data analytics and visualization for bioinformatics and healthcare. Each year many patients have suffered cancers. Analytics and visualization can help to simulate the development of malignant tumors and help identify weak spots of tumor for treatment, inspect malignant tumors in general and inspect whether genes have cancerous cells. Related literature, technologies, simulation results with explanation, performance evaluation and comparisons with other work have been discussed in details. We can process training data with a low completion time to achieve simulations of malignant tumors and genes to inspect their status, as well as the querying the output data within seconds. Our malignant tumor and gene simulation can achieve 360 degrees for an inspection of cancerous presence. We conclude that data analytics and visualization can provide effective and efficient healthcare research and also other type of interdisciplinary research.","authors":["Victor Chang"],"meta":["July 2018Multimedia Tools and Applications 77(3):1-15","DOI:10.1007/s11042-017-5186-8"],"references":["311778875_SmallClient_for_big_data_an_indexing_framework_towards_fast_data_retrieval","304006393_Big_Data_A_Parallel_Particle_Swarm_Optimization-Back-Propagation_Neural_Network_Algorithm_Based_on_MapReduce","345656599_Modelling_Survival_Data_in_Medical_Research","330221498_Stochastic_modelling_for_systems_biology_Second_edition","324400311_Modelling_Survival_Data_in_Medical_Research","321593815_Diagnosis_and_Treatment_of_Genitourinary_Malignancies","316260954_Gene-based_Collaborative_Filtering_using_recommender_system","315541580_Towards_data_analysis_for_Weather_Cloud_Computing","286126701_Cancer_Chemotherapy_in_Clinical_Practice","278028780_Experimental_Design_and_Data_Analysis_For_Biologists","273391970_Personal_Visualization_and_Personal_Visual_Analytics","275199362_The_Business_Intelligence_as_a_Service_in_the_Cloud","273968945_Modelling_Survival_Data_in_Medical_Research","247651130_Stochastic_Modelling_for_Systems_Biology","231375781_OntoMODEL_Ontological_Mathematical_Modeling_Knowledge_Management_in_Pharmaceutical_Product_Development_2_Applications"]}
