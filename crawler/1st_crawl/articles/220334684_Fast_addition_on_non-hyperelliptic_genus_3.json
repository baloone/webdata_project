{"id":"220334684_Fast_addition_on_non-hyperelliptic_genus_3","abstract":"We present a fast addition algorithm in the Jacobian of a genus 3 non-hyperelliptic curve over a field of any characteristic. When the curve has a rational flex and char(k) > 5, the computational cost for addition is 148M + 15SQ+ 2I and 165M + 20SQ+ 2I for doubling.","authors":["St√©phane Flon","Roger Oyono","Christophe Ritzenthaler"],"meta":["January 2004","DOI:10.1142/9789812793430_0001","SourceDBLP"],"references":["239062808_Fast_Genus_Three_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","312627077_A_subexponential_algorithm_for_discrete_logarithms_over_the_rational_subgroup_of_the_Jacobians_of_large_genus_hyperelliptic_curves_over_finite_fields","297316323_Index_calculus_attack_for_hyperelliptic_curves_of_small_genus","281567412_An_algorithm_for_solving_the_discrete_log_problem_on_hyperelliptic_curves","267110273_Remark_on_Hessians_and_flexes","265459538_Plane_algebraic_curves","240011505_Funny_plane_curves_in_characteristic_P_0","239061442_Fast_Genus_Two_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","227184388_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems_Closing_the_Performance_Gap_to_Elliptic_Curves","225771651_Implementing_the_Arithmetic_of_C34_Curves"]}
