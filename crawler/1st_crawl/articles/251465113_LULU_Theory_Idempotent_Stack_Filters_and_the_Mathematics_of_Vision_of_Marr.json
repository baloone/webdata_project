{"id":"251465113_LULU_Theory_Idempotent_Stack_Filters_and_the_Mathematics_of_Vision_of_Marr","abstract":"In Part II of this work I survey in coherent form, with polished proofs when given, \nmy theoretical endeavours (I'm no \"practitioner\") in nonlinear signal processing from their beginnings in 1998. It is not merely a survey paper; some new material features as well. That includes, e.g., a more elegant derivation of the conditions characterizing the co-idempotency of a stack filter. Part I, written by Carl Rohwer, additionally dwells on the practical benefits of LULU-filters, in particular on how and why they beat the still widely used median filters.","authors":["C.H.
