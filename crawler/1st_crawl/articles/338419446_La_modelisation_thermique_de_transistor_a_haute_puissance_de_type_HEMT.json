The appearance of mechatronic systems gives rise to failure and degradation phenomena that develop over time and are not well controlled. To study these failures we will use the finite element method, is a numerical scheme (method) that allows to simulate (solve) complicated physics problems via the computer tool. This is made by approximating the mathematical model based on a partial differential equation whose number of unknowns is infinite with a matrix algebraic model whose number of unknowns is finite. The implementation of this method is made with two software programs COMSOL and ANSYS, and the simulations will allow us to observe the behavior of our component and detect the origin of the failures.","authors":["Amar Abdelhamid","Bouchaib Radi","Abdelkhalak ELHami"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.21494/ISTE.OP.2019.0431"],"references":["309961786_Effects_of_Field_Plate_on_the_Maximum_Temperature_and_Temperature_Distribution_for_GaN_HEMT_Devices","272017917_InAlNGaN_HEMTs_based_L-band_high-power_packaged_amplifiers","257380575_Novel_packaging_design_for_high-power_GaN-on-Si_high_electron_mobility_transistors_HEMTs","3430430_Reliability_of_GaN_High-Electron-Mobility_Transistors_State_of_the_Art_and_Perspectives"]}
