{"id":"334335572_Machine_learning_estimators_for_lattice_QCD_observables","abstract":"A novel technique using machine learning (ML) to reduce the computational cost of evaluating lattice QCD observables is presented. The ML is trained on a subset of background gauge field configurations, called the labeled set, to predict an observable O from the values of correlated, but less compute-intensive, observables X calculated on the full sample. By using a second subset, also part of the labeled set, we estimate the bias in the result predicted by the trained ML algorithm. A reduction in the computational cost by about 7%â€“38% is demonstrated for two different lattice QCD calculations using the Boosted decision tree regression ML algorithm: (1) prediction of the nucleon three-point correlation functions that yield isovector charges from the two-point correlation functions and (2) prediction of the phase acquired by the neutron mass when a small CP violating interaction, the quark chromoelectric dipole moment interaction, is added to QCD, again from the two-point correlation functions calculated without CP violation.","authors":["Boram Yoon","Tanmoy Bhattacharya","Rajan Gupta"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevD.100.014504"],"references":["327132848_Isovector_charges_of_the_nucleon_from_2_1_1_-flavor_lattice_QCD","322568417_Machine_learning_action_parameters_in_lattice_quantum_chromodynamics","319534624_Deep_Learning_Beyond_Lefschetz_Thimbles","333464017_Towards_a_determination_of_the_nucleon_EDM_from_the_quark_chromo-EDM_operator_with_the_gradient_flow","333459603_Neutron_Electric_Dipole_Moment_from_Beyond_the_Standard_Model","329475599_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_Via_the_Lasso","316985486_Machine_Learning_of_Explicit_Order_Parameters_From_the_Ising_Model_to_SU2_Lattice_Gauge_Theory","304271107_Axial_Scalar_and_Tensor_Charges_of_the_Nucleon_from_211-flavor_Lattice_QCD","301874785_Controlling_Excited-State_Contamination_in_Nucleon_Matrix_Elements","285648583_Neutron_and_proton_electric_dipole_moments_from_N_f21_domain-wall_fermion_lattice_QCD"]}
