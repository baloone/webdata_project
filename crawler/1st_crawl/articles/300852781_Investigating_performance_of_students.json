{"id":"300852781_Investigating_performance_of_students","abstract":"This paper, investigates how academic performance of students evolves over the years in their studies during a study programme. To determine typical progression patterns over the years, students are described by a 4 tuple (e.g. x1, x2, x3, x4), these being the clusters' mean to which a student belongs to in each year of the degree. For this purpose, two consecutive cohorts have been analyzed using X-means clustering. Interestingly the patterns found in both cohorts show that a substantial number of students stay in the same kind of groups during their studies.","authors":["Raheela Asif","Agathe Merceron","Mahmood Khan Pathan"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1145/2723576.2723579","Conference: the Fifth International Conference"],"references":["287718318_Predicting_Student_Academic_Performance_at_Degree_Level_A_Case_Study","269475545_Predicting_Student_Performance_by_Using_Data_Mining_Methods_for_Classification","221570422_Predicting_Graduate-level_Performance_from_Undergraduate_Achievements","2532744_X-means_Extending_K-means_with_Efficient_Estimation_of_the_Number_of_Clusters","290035534_Investigating_performances's_progress_of_students","288802650_Analyzing_the_longitudinal_K-12_grading_histories_of_entire_cohorts_of_students_Grades_data_driven_decision_making_dropping_out_and_hierarchical_cluster_analysis","224061246_Predicting_Academic_Performance"]}
