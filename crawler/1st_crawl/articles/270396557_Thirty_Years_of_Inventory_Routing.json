{"id":"270396557_Thirty_Years_of_Inventory_Routing","abstract":"The inventory-routing problem (IRP) dates back 30 years. It can be described as the combination of vehicle-routing and inventory management problems, in which a supplier has to deliver products to a number of geographically dispersed customers, subject to side constraints. It provides integrated logistics solutions by simultaneously optimizing inventory management, vehicle routing, and delivery scheduling. Some exact algorithms and several powerful metaheuristic and matheuristic approaches have been developed for this class of problems, especially in recent years. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of this literature, based on a new classification of the problem. We categorize IRPs with respect to their structural variants and the availability of information on customer demand.","authors":["Leandro C Coelho","Jean-Fran√ßois Cordeau","Gilbert Laporte"],"meta":["January 2015Transportation Science 48(1):1-19","DOI:10.1287/trsc.2013.0472","Project: Inventory-routing and integrated logistics problems"],"references":["262167903_Decomposition_of_a_Combined_Inventory_and_Time_Constrained_Ship_Routing_Problem","257697360_Selective_and_periodic_inventory_routing_problem_for_waste_vegetable_oil_collection","255700630_Randomized_Local_Search_for_Real-Life_Inventory_Routing","251306029_Using_and_extending_fix-and-relax_to_solve_maritime_inventory_routing_problems","245280456_A_Dynamic_Distribution_Model_with_Warehouse_and_Customer_Replenishment_Requirements","243990920_The_storage_constrained_inbound_inventory_routing_problem","236110395_An_Allocation_and_Distribution_Model_for_Perishable_Products","235954637_Minimizing_Transportation_and_Inventory_Costs_for_Several_Products_on_a_Single_Link","281579667_The_whose_where_and_how_of_inventory_control_design","281146180_Dynamic_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_Three_Decades_and_Counting","279655518_Modelling_path_flows_for_a_combined_ship_routing_and_inventory_management_problem","279335446_International_Series_in_Operations_Research_Management_Science","270673483_Formulations_and_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithms_for_Multivehicle_Production_and_Inventory_Routing_Problems","268886836_The_logic_of_logistics_Theory_algorithms_and_applications_for_logistics_and_supply_chain_management_2nd_ed","266415650_Optimization-Based_Adaptive_Large_Neighborhood_Search_for_the_Production_Routing_Problem","265332087_A_genetic_algorithm_approach_to_the_integrated_inventory-distribution_problem","265303019_Handbook_of_Metaheuristics","264559332_Heuristics_for_dynamic_and_stochastic_inventory-routing","263371641_A_branch-and-cut_algorithm_for_the_multi-product_multi-vehicle_inventory-routing_problem","261976309_A_Branch-Price-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_Single-Product_Maritime_Inventory_Routing","257790329_Mixed_integer_linear_programming_model_for_multi-commodity_multi-depot_inventory_routing_problem","257642084_A_variable_neighborhood_search_for_the_multi-product_inventory_routing_problem","257603169_A_Heuristic_Method_for_the_Inventory_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","257429749_Consistency_in_multi-vehicle_inventory-routing","257404514_Variable_Neighborhood_Search_heuristic_for_the_Inventory_Routing_Problem_in_fuel_delivery","257196381_Ship_routing_and_scheduling_in_the_new_millennium","257153672_The_exact_solution_of_several_classes_of_inventory-routing_problems","257153538_The_inventory-routing_problem_with_transshipment","257153412_A_branch-and-price_guided_search_approach_to_maritime_inventory_routing","256967318_Workforce_Management_in_Periodic_Delivery_Operations","251630804_A_rolling_horizon_heuristic_for_creating_a_liquefied_natural_gas_annual_delivery_program","251565069_A_maritime_inventory_routing_problem_Practical_approach","251463789_Chapter_6_Vehicle_Routing","251463787_Chapter_4_Maritime_Transportation","247370162_Reducing_Logistics_Costs_at_General_Motors","245376926_Analysis_of_a_Large-Scale_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_an_Inventory_Component","245281520_Robust_Distribution_Planning_for_Supplier-Managed_Inventory_Agreements_When_Demand_Rates_and_Travel_Times_Are_Stationary","245280947_Marine_inventory_routing_Shipments_planning","242932625_Heuristics_for_a_One_Warehouse_Multi_Retailer_Distribution_Problem_with_Performance_Bounds","242932102_Distribution_Strategies_that_Minimize_Transportation_and_Inventory_Cost","242916545_A_method_for_solving_ship_routing_problemswith_inventory_constraints","239386112_Fixed_Routes","238836859_Stochastic_Inventory_Routing_Route_Design_with_Stockouts_and_Route_Failures","238832679_Modelling_path_flows_for_a_combined_ship_routingand_inventory_management_problem","238244932_Improving_the_distribution_of_industrial_gases_with_an_online_computerized_routing_and_scheduling_op","236110508_Alternative_Inventory_and_Distribution_Policies_of_a_Food_Manufacturer","236110399_A_Combined_Vehicle_Routing_and_Inventory_Allocation_Problem","236110186_Redesigning_distribution_operations_A_case_study_on_integrating_inventory_management_and_vehicle_routes_design","236110103_Solving_An_Integrated_Logistics_Problem_Arising_In_Grocery_Distribution","235316129_Measuring_Supply_Chain_Performance","233843551_Vehicle_Routing","234126233_A_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_Using_a_StrongFormulation_and_an_A_Priori_Tour-BasedHeuristic_for_an_Inventory-Routing_Problem","232394598_A_construction_and_improvement_heuristic_for_a_liquefied_natural_gas_inventory_routing_problem","230818393_A_stochastic_inventory_routing_problem_with_stock-out","230315601_Algorithm_for_optimal_shipments_with_given_frequencies"]}
