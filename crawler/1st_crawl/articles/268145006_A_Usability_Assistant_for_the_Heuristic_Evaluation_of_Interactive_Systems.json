{"id":"268145006_A_Usability_Assistant_for_the_Heuristic_Evaluation_of_Interactive_Systems","abstract":"The increasing demands for usable interactive systems in the context of limited project budgets bring in front the need for faster and cheaper evaluation methods. Heuristic evaluation is a kind of inspection method that proved to be cost effective. Typically, the method involves a small number of evaluators that are testing the interactive system against a set of usability principles called heuristics. A way to increase the efficiency of usability evaluation methods is to provide evaluators with software tools able to assist in documenting and recording of usability problems. This paper presents a software assistant for usability evaluation which provides with various facilities to conduct heuristic evaluation: definition of the tasks set, specification of heuristics used, and documenting of usability problems. In order to support the specific requirements of a target application domain a set of usability guidelines could be specified that are detailing the heuristic set. These guidelines could be consulted during usability problem identification and specification. This way, a broader range of evaluator preferences and requirements could be accommodated.","authors":["Costin Pribeanu"],"meta":["December 2009Studies in Informatics and Control 18(4):355-362"],"references":["269618533_A_tool_for_working_with_guidelines_for_e-commerce_web_sites","256460842_O_abordare_bazata_pe_sarcina_in_proiectarea_unui_asistent_software_de_evaluare_a_utilizabilitatii","242574984_Understanding_Inspection_Methods_Lessons_from_an_Assessment_of_Heuristic_Evaluation","228599255_A_methodological_approach_to_task-based_design_of_user_interfaces","221054739_ConcurTaskTrees_A_Diagrammatic_Notation_for_Specifying_Task_Models","288927259_Towards_the_Design_of_Effective_Formative_Test_Reports","277494465_Comparison_of_techniques_for_matching_of_usability_problem_descriptions","273596428_Comparing_Usability_Problem_Identification_and_Description_by_Practitioners_and_Students","259703389_Current_practice_in_measuring_usability_Challenges_to_usability_studies_and_research","242375192_Usability_engineering_at_a_discount"]}
