{"id":"332413771_Desktop_VR_as_a_Virtual_Workspace_a_Cognitive_Aspect","abstract":"This paper explores the benefits of using a desktop VR as a virtual workspace.\nForty-nine participants data included in this study. With a between-subjects design, we\ncompared the use of extra information between a desktop VR (23 people) and a web\nbrowser (26 people). Their tasks were to solve numerical tasks and write the results in a\nseparate spreadsheet. They could follow their performance (solved task / all tasks) on a\ngraph. Then, they filled out a questionnaire where they had to estimate their performance,\nand indicate the source of this estimation (the only valid source was the provided graph).\nIn the subsample of those who used the graph, the members of the VR group estimated\nsignificantly more accurately their performance than the members web browser group.\nTherefore, the 3D desktop VR workspace can provide benefits to its users by displaying\nextra information permanently.","authors":["Borb√°la Berki"],"meta":["April 2019Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 16(2):219-231.","DOI:10.12700/APH.16.2.2019.2.13","Project: Cognitive characteristics in the background of the effectiveness of 3D VR spaces"],"references":["329026645_Cooperative_Learning_in_VR_Environment","326326582_Factors_Contributing_to_the_Enhanced_Performance_of_the_MaxWhere_3D_VR_Platform_in_the_Distribution_of_Digital_Information","326326395_MaxWhere_VR-learning_improves_effectiveness_over_clasiccal_tools_of_e-learning","326065864_2D_Advertising_in_3D_Virtual_Spaces","326059796_Examining_the_Learning_Efficiency_by_a_Brain-Computer_Interface_System","322707143_Developing_cognitive_processes_for_improving_inventive_thinking_in_system_development_using_a_collaborative_virtual_reality_system","327540568_Towards_a_Modern_Integrated_Virtual_Laboratory_System","322710316_Teaching_electrical_machines_in_a_3D_virtual_space","322707403_Presentation_of_a_medieval_church_in_MaxWhere","322707112_The_IT_device_demand_of_the_edu-coaching_method_in_the_higher_education_of_engineering"]}
