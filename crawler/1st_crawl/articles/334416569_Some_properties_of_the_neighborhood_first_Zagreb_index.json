{"id":"334416569_Some_properties_of_the_neighborhood_first_Zagreb_index","abstract":"The neighborhood first Zagreb index (NM1) has been recently introduced for characterizing the topological structure of molecular graphs. In this study, we present some sharp bounds on the index NM1 and establish its relations with the first and second Zagreb indices in case of some special graphs. It is verified and demonstrated on examples that in several cases, the index NM1 outperforms the discriminating performance of the majority of traditional degree-based molecular descriptors (for example, Randic connectivity index, the sum-connectivity index, the harmonic index, the geometric-arithmetic index, etc.).","authors":["Tamás Réti","Akbar Ali","Péter Varga","E.
