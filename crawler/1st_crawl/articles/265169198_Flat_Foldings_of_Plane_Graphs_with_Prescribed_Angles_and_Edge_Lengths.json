{"id":"265169198_Flat_Foldings_of_Plane_Graphs_with_Prescribed_Angles_and_Edge_Lengths","abstract":"When can a plane graph with prescribed edge lengths and prescribed angles\n(from among $\\{0,180^\\circ, 360^\\circ\\}$) be folded flat to lie in an\ninfinitesimally thick line, without crossings? This problem generalizes the\nclassic theory of single-vertex flat origami with prescribed mountain-valley\nassignment, which corresponds to the case of a cycle graph. We characterize\nsuch flat-foldable plane graphs by two obviously necessary but also sufficient\nconditions, proving a conjecture made in 2001: the angles at each vertex should\nsum to $360^\\circ$, and every face of the graph must itself be flat foldable.\nThis characterization leads to a linear-time algorithm for testing flat\nfoldability of plane graphs with prescribed edge lengths and angles, and a\npolynomial-time algorithm for counting the number of distinct folded states.","authors":["Zachary Ryan Abel","Erik D.
