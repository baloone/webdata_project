{"id":"307139233_Cognitive_abilities_of_health_and_art_college_students_a_pilot_study","abstract":"[Purpose] The selection of a college major is a struggle that high school students undergo every year; however, there is a dearth of studies examining the role of cognitive ability tests as a tool for determining the aptitude of prospective students. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess cognitive ability differences among students. [Subjects and Methods] A convenience sample of 60 college students (30 health science and 30 art students) with a mean age of 19 ± 1.6 years, voluntarily participated in this study. Cognitive ability was assessed using the self-administered Cognitive Assessment of Minnesota (CAM) scale under the supervision of a researcher. [Results] The findings indicated that there was a significant cognitive ability difference between health science and art students, especially in the cognitive components of knowledge, calculation, and thinking. However, the difference in the social cognitive component of both the health science and art students was not significant. [Conclusion] The results indicate that the health science students’ cognitive abilities were better than those of the art students. This finding implies that it is important for high school graduates to undertake a cognitive ability assessment prior to choosing a subject major. Hence, it is recommended that cognitive scales should be included as an aptitude assessment tool for the decision-makers and prospective students to determine an appropriate career, since it might reduce the percentage of university drop-out ratio.","authors":["Sami Alabdulwahab"],"meta":["May 2016Journal of Physical Therapy Science 28(5):1454-1458","DOI:10.1589/jpts.28.1454"],"references":["320486564_Multidisciplinary_Screening_of_Cognitive_Impairment_Following_Acquired_Brain_Impairment_Is_there_Repetition","312900076_Behavioral_genetics_of_cognitive_ability_A_life-span_perspective","288480043_Association_between_handgrip_strength_and_cognitive_impairment_in_elderly_Koreans_A_population-based_cross-sectional_study","285214859_Correlation_between_the_Mini_Mental_State_Examination-Korean_version_and_the_Measurement_of_Quality_of_the_Environment_in_the_institutionalized_elderly","280119716_Sex_differences_in_social_cognitive_factors_and_physical_activity_in_Korean_college_students","275664101_The_effect_of_computer-assisted_cognitive_rehabilitation_and_repetitive_transcranial_magnetic_stimulation_on_cognitive_function_for_stroke_patients","273897715_College_Performance_and_Retention_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Predictive_Validities_of_ACT_R_Scores_High_School_Grades_and_SES","263461313_Social-Cognitive_Predictors_of_STEM_Career_Interests_and_Goal_Persistence_in_College_Students_With_Disabilities_From_Racial_and_Ethnic_Minority_Backgrounds","258825270_Relationships_between_Physical_and_Cognitive_Functioning_and_Activities_of_Daily_Living_in_Children_with_Cerebral_Palsy","263521610_Rethinking_College_Students'_Self-Regulation_and_Sustained_AttentionDoes_Text_Messaging_During_Class_Influence_Cognitive_Learning"]}
