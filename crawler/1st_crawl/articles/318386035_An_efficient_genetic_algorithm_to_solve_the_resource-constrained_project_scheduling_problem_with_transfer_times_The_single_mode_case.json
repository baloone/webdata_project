{"id":"318386035_An_efficient_genetic_algorithm_to_solve_the_resource-constrained_project_scheduling_problem_with_transfer_times_The_single_mode_case","abstract":"In this article, we address the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with transfer times (RCPSPTT). We assume that pre-emption is not allowed, and precedence relations are zero-lag finish-to-start relations. We also assume that the durations and resource transfer times of activities are known and deterministic. The objective is to choose a start time for each activity of the project so that the project duration is minimized, while satisfying precedence relations, resource availabilities, and resource-transfer time constraints. We propose a new genetic algorithm using a two-point crossover operator. The experiment, conducted on a large number of instances, shows that the proposed algorithm performs better than several solution methods previously published.","authors":["Roubila Lilia KADRI","Fayez Boctor"],"meta":["July 2017European Journal of Operational Research 265(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.07.027"],"references":["237899185_Solving_the_MultiMode_Resource-Constrained_Project_Scheduling_Problem_with_genetic_algorithms","23991345_An_efficient_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_for_scheduling_projects_with_resource_constraints_and_multiple_execution_modes","2753293_On_Permutation_Representations_for_Scheduling_Problems","284761945_Une_methode_arborescente_pour_resoudre_les_problemes_cumulatifs","284046228_An_Algorithm_for_Finding_Optimal_or_Near_Optimal_Solutions_to_the_Production_Scheduling_Problem","280887190_Local_for_multi-mode_resource-constrained_project","277908642_A_flow-based_tabu_search_algorithm_for_the_RCPSP_with_transfer_times","264480100_A_self-adapting_genetic_algorithm_for_project_scheduling_under_resource_constraints","257196654_A_competitive_magnet-based_genetic_algorithm_for_solving_the_resource-constrained_project_scheduling_problem","243658355_The_critical-path_method_Resources_planning_and_scheduling","227443395_A_Zero-One_Programming_Approach_to_Scheduling_with_Limited_Resources","227414867_A_heuristic_solution_framework_for_the_resource_constrained_multi-project_scheduling_problem_with_sequence-dependent_transfer_times","223653517_A_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_for_the_Resource-Constrained_Project_Scheduling_Problem","223586159_A_new_efficient_simulated_annealing_algorithm_for_the_resource-constrained_project_scheduling_problem_and_its_multiple_mode_version","222850721_An_efficient_optimal_solution_procedure_for_the_preemptive_resource-constrained_project_scheduling_problem","222670479_A_hybrid_scatterelectromagnetism_meta-heuristic_for_project_scheduling","222495330_Serial_and_Parallel_Resource-Constrained_Project_Scheduling_Methods_Revisited_Theory_and_Computation","222465334_Scheduling_subject_to_resource_constraints_classification_and_complexity_preprint","222306272_Efficient_Priority_Rules_for_the_Resource-Constrained_Project_Scheduling_Problem","221704653_Resource-constrained_project_scheduling_simulated_annealing","220471457_A_random_key_based_genetic_algorithm_for_the_resource_constrained_project_scheduling_problem","220462290_A_Population-Based_Approach_to_the_Resource-Constrained_Project_Scheduling_Problem","220461907_Project_Scheduling_with_Multiple_Modes_A_Genetic_Algorithm","220176570_Using_an_enhanced_scatter_search_algorithm_for_a_resource-constrained_project_scheduling_problem","4941243_Computational_Experience_with_a_Backtracking_Algorithm_for_Solving_a_General_Class_of_Precedence_and_Resource-Constrained_Scheduling_Problems","4941239_Some_efficient_multi-heuristic_procedures_for_resource-constrained_project_scheduling","2290953_A_Competitive_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Resource-Constrained_Project_Scheduling"]}
