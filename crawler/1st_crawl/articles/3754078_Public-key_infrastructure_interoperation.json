Commercial products\nenable an organization to be its own private certification authority.\nCertification service out-sourcers provide a more painless way to\nachieve the same end. Public certification service providers offer\nservices that bind individuals or organizations together into\ncommunities. However, for certain purposes, the drive persists to link\nthese infrastructures into ever-larger communities of interoperating\ninfrastructures. In particular, the market demand for certificate-based\nsingle sign-on capabilities and the dream of the global Internet secure\nelectronic mail community fuel this drive. This paper explores some\nmajor issues in achieving such interoperation, including the meaning of\nthe cross-certification concept; the trust dilution problem; and the\nsecurity, policy, and practices measures that are needed to achieve the\ntrust needed to make such large-scale interoperation possible","authors":["W.
