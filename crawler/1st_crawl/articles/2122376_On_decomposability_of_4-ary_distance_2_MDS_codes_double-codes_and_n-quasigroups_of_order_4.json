The adjacency graph of a $t$-fold MDS code is not connected if and only if the characteristic function of the code is the repetition-free sum of the characteristic functions of $t$-fold MDS codes of smaller lengths. \nIn the case $t=2$, the theory has the following application. The union of two disjoint $(n,4^{n-1},2)$ MDS codes in $\\{0,1,2,3\\}^n$ is a double-MDS-code. If the adjacency graph of the double-MDS-code is not connected, then the double-code can be decomposed into double-MDS-codes of smaller lengths. If the graph has more than two connected components, then the MDS codes are also decomposable. The result has an interpretation as a test for reducibility of $n$-quasigroups of order 4. \nKeywords: MDS codes, n-quasigroups, decomposability, reducibility, frequency hypercubes, latin hypercubes","authors":["Denis S Krotov"],"meta":["September 2005Discrete Mathematics 308(15):3322-3334","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2007.06.038","SourcearXiv"],"references":["227175023_On_Multifold_MDS_and_Perfect_Codes_That_Are_Not_Splittable_into_Onefold_Codes","2127723_Asymptotics_for_the_number_of_n-quasigroups_of_order_4","288306096_On_generalized_concatenated_constructions_of_perfect_binary_nonlinear_codes","266363463_Switchings_and_Perfect_Codes","266243419_Constructions_of_perfect_binary_nonlinear_codes","266002460_Canonical_decomposition_of_n-ary_quasigroups","240965948_A_General_Product_Construction_for_Error_Correcting_Codes","222405966_Hamiltonian_double_latin_squares","220638566_The_Classification_of_Some_Perfect_Codes"]}
