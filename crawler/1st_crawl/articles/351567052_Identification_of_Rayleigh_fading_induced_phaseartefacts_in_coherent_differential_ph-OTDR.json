{"id":"351567052_Identification_of_Rayleigh_fading_induced_phaseartefacts_in_coherent_differential_ph-OTDR","abstract":"Differential phase optical time-domain reflectometry is subject to Rayleigh fading, which locally impedes proper phase extraction. We introduce in this Letter a reliability metric derived from the measured Jones matrix estimates of the fiber sensor to discriminate between true perturbations and false alarms caused by Rayleigh backscatter fading points. The proposed soft-decision metric is also of interest for further post-processing stages exploiting artificial intelligence based classifiers.","authors":["Christian Dorize","Sterenn Guerrier","Elie Awwad","Jeremie Renaudier"],"meta":["May 2021Optics Letters 46(11)","DOI:10.1364/OL.427944","Project: Optical fiber sensing"],"references":["342458899_Introducing_Coherent_MIMO_Sensing_a_fading-resilient_polarization-independent_approach_to_ph-OTDR","341222479_Detection-Localization-Identification_of_Vibrations_over_Long_Distance_SSMF_with_Coherent_Delta-Phi-OTDR","323276947_Enhancing_performance_of_coherent_OTDR_systems_with_polarization_diversity_complementary_codes","343646571_Quantitative_amplitude-measuring_PH-OTDR_with_peHz_sensitivity_using_a_multi-frequency_pulse_train","332703757_Distributed_Dynamic_Strain_Sensing_via_Perfect_Periodic_Coherent_Codes_and_a_Polarization_Diversity_Receiver","328248524_Femtosecond_laser-inscribed_harsh_environment_fiber_bragg_grating_sensors","327003612_Fiber-Optic_Distributed_Strain_Sensing_Needle_for_Real-Time_Guidance_in_Epidural_Anesthesia","322085854_The_use_of_multi-frequency_acquisition_to_significantly_improve_the_quality_of_fibre-optic_distributed_vibration_sensing","311408260_On_the_sensitivity_of_distributed_acoustic_sensing","309082275_A_Fading-Discrimination_Method_for_Distributed_Vibration_Sensor_Using_Coherent_Detection_of_ph-OTDR"]}
