{"id":"261730577_State_space_control_system_design_based_on_non-minimal_state-variable_feedback_Further_generalization_and_unification_results","abstract":"This paper shows how proportional-integral-plus linear-quadratic (PIP-LQ) control, based on non-minimal state space (NMSS) control system design, can be constrained to yield exactly the same control algorithm as both generalized predictive control (GPC) and standard, minimal state, linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) design methods. However, while NMSS includes these other approaches as special cases, it is less constrained and so more flexible in general terms: for example, while PIP-LQ has the simplicity of GPC, it is formulated like LQG in the powerful context of state variable feedback (SVF) control, which allows for ready access to modern robust control methods. Furthermore, the paper suggests that the NMSS approach provides the greater design freedom, with a wider range of possible LQ solutions than its minimal state space equivalent.","authors":["C.
