{"id":"226646116_Minimum_cost_spanning_tree_games","abstract":"We consider the problem of cost allocation among users of a minimum cost spanning tree network. It is formulated as a cooperative game in characteristic function form, referred to as a minimum cost spanning tree (m.c.s.t.) game. We show that the core of a m.c.s.t. game is never empty. In fact, a point in the core can be read directly from any minimum cost spanning tree graph associated with the problem. For m.c.s.t. games with efficient coalition structures we define and construct m.c.s.t. games on the components of the structure. We show that the core and the nucleolus of the original game are the cartesian products of the cores and the nucleoli, respectively, of the induced games on the components of the efficient coalition structure.","authors":["Daniel Granot","Gur Huberman"],"meta":["December 1981Mathematical Programming 21(1):1-18","DOI:10.1007/BF01584227"],"references":["346806807_A_VALUE_FOR_-PERSON_GAMES","285130272_A_value_for_a'-person_games","243773435_Computational_Complexity_of_the_Game_Theory_Approach_to_Cost_Allocation_for_a_Tree","240013494_Game_Theory_Applicaton_to_Cost_Allocation_for_a_Spannmg_Tree","235120164_Computation_of_the_kernels_of_simple_games_and_the_nucleolus_of_n-person_games_Technical_report","229796842_Cost_Allocation_for_a_Spanning_Tree","229724442_On_cost_allocation_for_a_spanning_tree_A_game_theoretic_approach","228108105_A_value_for_n-person_games","226656019_A_Simple_Expression_for_the_Nucleolus_in_a_Special_Case"]}
