{"id":"332180999_Deep-Learning_Domain_Adaptation_Techniques_for_Credit_Cards_Fraud_Detection","abstract":"Although the incidence of credit card fraud is limited to a small percentage of transactions, the related financial losses may be huge. This demands the design of automatic Fraud Detection Systems (FDS) able to detect fraudulent transactions with high precision and deal with the heterogeneous nature of the fraudster behavior. Indeed, the nature of the fraud behavior may strongly differ according to the payment system (e.g. e-commerce or shop terminal), the country and the population segment. Given the high cost of designing data-driven FDSs, it is more and more important for transactional companies to reuse existing pipelines and adapt them to different domains and contexts: this boils down to a well-known problem of transfer learning.","authors":["Bertrand Lebichot","Yann-Aël Le Borgne","Liyun He","Frédéric Oblé"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-16841-4_8","Project: Fraud detection with machine learning"],"references":["319867396_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_A_Realistic_Modeling_and_a_Novel_Learning_Strategy","319616537_SCARFF_a_Scalable_Framework_for_Streaming_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_with_Spark","311153782_A_graph-based_semi-supervised_credit_card_fraud_detection_system","281461046_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_and_Concept-Drift_Adaptation_with_Delayed_Supervised_Information","277333816_Domain-Adversarial_Training_of_Neural_Networks","322836834_Sequence_Classification_for_Credit-Card_Fraud_Detection","319649103_Domain-Adversarial_Training_of_Neural_Networks","310752944_Frustratingly_easy_domain_adaptation","305386599_Domain_adaptation_for_large-scale_sentiment_classification_A_deep_learning_approach","276152711_APATE_A_Novel_Approach_for_Automated_Credit_Card_Transaction_Fraud_Detection_using_Network-Based_Extensions"]}
