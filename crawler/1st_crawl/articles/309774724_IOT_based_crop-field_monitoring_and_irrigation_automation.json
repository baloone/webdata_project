{"id":"309774724_IOT_based_crop-field_monitoring_and_irrigation_automation","abstract":"Internet Of Things (IoT)is a shared network of objects or things which can interact with each other provided the internet connection. IoT plays an important role in agriculture industry which can feed 9.6 billion people on the Earth by 2050. Smart Agriculture helps to reduce wastage, effective usage of fertilizer and thereby increase the crop yield. In this work, a system is developed to monitor crop-field using sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, Light) and automate the irrigation system. The data from sensors are sent to web server database using wireless transmission. In server database the data are encoded in JSON format. The irrigation is automated if the moisture and temperature of the field falls below the brink. In greenhouses light intensity control can also be automated in addition to irrigation. The notifications are sent to farmers' mobile periodically. The farmers' can able to monitor the field conditions from anywhere. This system will be more useful in areas where water is in scarce. This system is 92% more efficient than the conventional approach.","authors":["P Rajalakshmi","Devi Mahalakshmi"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1109/ISCO.2016.7726900","Conference: 2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)"],"references":["287626658_Sensor_Technologies_for_Precision_Soil_Nutrient_Management_and_Monitoring","274264066_Energy_efficient_automated_control_of_irrigation_in_agriculture_by_using_wireless_sensor_networks","260303884_Automated_Irrigation_System_Using_a_Wireless_Sensor_Network_and_GPRS_Module","255640670_Preliminary_Design_on_the_Development_of_Wireless_Sensor_Network_for_Paddy_Rice_Cropping_Monitoring_Application_in_Malaysia","239867353_Soil_moisture-based_irrigation_control_to_conserve_water_and_nutrients_under_drip_irrigated_vegetable_production","224933939_Fieldservers_and_Sensor_Service_Grid_as_Real-time_Monitoring_Infrastructure_for_Ubiquitous_Sensor_Networks","49966025_Intelligent_Humidity_Sensor_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Agricultural_Application","281413924_Sensor_Based_Automated_Irrigation_System","266287407_Microcontroller-based_Automatic_Irrigation_System_with_Moisture_Sensors","261204075_Basic_guidelines_for_deploying_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_in_agriculture","224289112_A_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Prototype_for_Environmental_Monitoring_in_Greenhouses","224230022_Wireless_Sensor_Network_for_Precise_Agriculture_Monitoring","224215006_Self-Autonomous_Wireless_Sensor_Nodes_With_Wind_Energy_Harvesting_for_Remote_Sensing_of_Wind-Driven_Wildfire_Spread","222551618_Evaluation_of_a_crop_water_stress_index_for_detecting_water_stress_in_winter_wheat_in_the_North_China_Plain","222061169_A_low-cost_microcontroller-based_system_to_monitor_crop_temperature_and_water_status"]}
