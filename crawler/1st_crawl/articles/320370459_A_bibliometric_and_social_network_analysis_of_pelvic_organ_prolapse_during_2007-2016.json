{"id":"320370459_A_bibliometric_and_social_network_analysis_of_pelvic_organ_prolapse_during_2007-2016","abstract":"Background: \nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) seriously affects the life quality of old females. In the present work, we described the knowledge structure of POP in a macroscopic view, and summarized the recent research focus.\n\nMethods: \nCandidates were identified through reading and screening publications from PubMed database with a MeSH term of \"pelvic organ prolapse\" during 2007-2016. Relevant journals and journal-affiliated countries were extracted, and essential information, such as the number of publication of each year, first authors and MeSH/subheading words, was analyzed with BICOMB. In addition, highly-frequent MeSH/subheading words were determined and classified, and co-occurrence matrices were produced accordingly. Finally, social network was utilized to analyze the knowledge structure.\n\nResults: \nA total of 3294 publications of POP were retrieved from 364 journals. The publication of POP had a significant downward trend since the beginning of 2015. POP articles published in American and British journals were significantly more compared with other countries. The co-occurrence matrices of 37 × 37 and 55 × 55 were produced by the highly-frequent MeSH/subheading words, and then the social network analysis was performed based on them.\n\nConclusion: \nThese publications on POP were mainly from the developed countries. Surgical treatment of POP was a hot topic of POP research in recent 10 years.","authors":["Feng Huang","Quan Zhou","Bing-Jie Leng","Qiao-Ling Mao"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of the Chinese Medical Association 81(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.jcma.2017.08.012"],"references":["303355277_A_clinical_study_on_the_trocar-guided_mesh_repair_system_for_pelvic_organ_prolapse_surgery","299985131_Outcomes_in_450_Women_After_Minimally_Invasive_Abdominal_Sacrocolpopexy_for_Pelvic_Organ_Prolapse","295159987_An_International_Urogynecological_Association_IUGAInternational_Continence_Society_ICS_Joint_Report_on_the_Terminology_for_Female_Pelvic_Floor_Dysfunction","293798286_Transvaginal_mesh_or_grafts_compared_with_native_tissue_repair_for_vaginal_prolapse","291012839_Anatomic_Outcomes_of_Robotic_Assisted_Supracervical_Hysterectomy_and_Concurrent_Sacrocolpopexy_at_a_Tertiary_Care_Institution_at_Initial_Adaptation_of_the_Procedure","286477952_Mapping_the_Knowledge_Structure_of_Neonatal_Hypoxic-Ischemic_Encephalopathy_Over_the_Past_Decade_A_Co-word_Analysis_Based_on_Keywords","285628275_Pain_Scores_and_Exposure_Rates_After_Polypropylene_Mesh_for_Pelvic_Organ_Prolapse","284020199_Trends_and_Factors_Influencing_Inpatient_Prolapse_Surgical_Costs_and_Length_of_Stay_in_the_United_States","283246493_Long-term_Outcome_After_Laparoscopic_Ventral_Mesh_Rectopexy","282048711_Factors_Affecting_Successfulness_of_Vaginal_Pessary_Use_for_the_Treatment_of_Pelvic_Organ_Prolapse"]}
