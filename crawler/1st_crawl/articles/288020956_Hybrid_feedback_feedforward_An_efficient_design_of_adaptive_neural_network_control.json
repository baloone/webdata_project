{"id":"288020956_Hybrid_feedback_feedforward_An_efficient_design_of_adaptive_neural_network_control","abstract":"This paper presents an efficient hybrid feedback feedforward (HFF) adaptive approximation-based control (AAC) strategy for a class of uncertain Euler-Lagrange systems. The control structure includes a proportional-derivative (PD) control term in the feedback loop and a radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network (NN) in the feedforward loop, which mimics the human motor learning control mechanism. At the presence of discontinuous friction, a sigmoid-jump-function NN is incorporated to improve control performance. The major difference of the proposed HFF-AAC design from the traditional feedback AAC (FB-AAC) design is that only desired outputs, rather than both tracking errors and desired outputs, are applied as RBF-NN inputs. Yet, such a slight modification leads to several attractive properties of HFF-AAC, including the convenient choice of an approximation domain, the decrease of the number of RBF-NN inputs, and semiglobal practical asymptotic stability dominated by control gains. Compared with previous HFF-AAC approaches, the proposed approach possesses the following two distinctive features: i) all above attractive properties are achieved by a much simpler control scheme; ii) the bounds of plant uncertainties are not required to be known. Consequently, the proposed approach guarantees a minimum configuration of the control structure and a minimum requirement of plant knowledge for the AAC design, which leads to a sharp decrease of implementation cost in terms of hardware selection, algorithm realization and system debugging. Simulation results have verified that the proposed HFF-AAC can perform as good as or even better than the traditional FB-AAC under much simpler control synthesis and much lower computational cost.","authors":["Yongping Pan","Yiqi Liu","Bin Xu","Haoyong Yu"],"meta":["April 2016Neural networks: the official journal of the International Neural Network Society 76","DOI:10.1016/j.neunet.2015.12.009"],"references":["282967265_Frame_Rate_and_Perceptual_Quality_for_HD_Video","257435876_Adaptive_neural_decentralized_control_for_strict_feedback_nonlinear_interconnected_systems_via_backstepping","224037575_Decentralized_neural_identifier_and_control_for_nonlinear_systems_based_on_extended_Kalman_filter","220372807_Globally_stable_adaptive_robust_tracking_control_using_RBF_neural_networks_as_feedforward_compensators","220183393_Heads_up_Biomechanics_modeling_and_neuromuscular_control_of_the_neck","45092434_Adaptive_Neural_Control_for_Output_Feedback_Nonlinear_Systems_Using_a_Barrier_Lyapunov_Function","3336405_Mixed_FeedforwardFeedback_Based_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Control_for_a_Class_of_MIMO_Nonlinear_Systems","287335255_Heads_up","278673516_Practical_adaptive_fuzzy_H_tracking_control_of_uncertain_nonlinear_systems","278672927_Biomimetic_hybrid_feedback_feedforward_adaptive_neural_control_of_robotic_arms","268794444_Adaptive_Neural_PD_Control_With_Semiglobal_Asymptotic_Stabilization_Guarantee","266378213_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Control_for_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Discrete-Time_Systems_With_Backlash","265423849_Passivity-Based_Control_of_Euler-Lagrange_Systems_Mechanical_Electrical_and_Electromechanical_Applications","264739357_Control_of_robots_using_radial_basis_function_neural_networks_with_dead-zone","263495385_Distributed_consensus_control_for_multi-agent_systems_using_terminal_sliding_mode_and_Chebyshev_neural_networks","263433228_Adaptive_NN_Tracking_Control_of_Uncertain_Nonlinear_Discrete-Time_Systems_With_Nonaffine_Dead-Zone_Input","261523754_Flatness-Based_adaptive_fuzzy_output_tracking_excitation_control_for_power_system_generators","260712520_Enhanced_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Control_With_Optimal_Approximation_Error_Convergence","260622175_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Control_via_Observer_Design_for_Uncertain_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Unmodeled_Dynamics","260354425_Adaptive_Dynamic_Output_Feedback_Neural_Network_Control_of_Uncertain_MIMO_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Prescribed_Performance","258101711_An_adaptive_recurrent_neural-network_controller_using_a_stabilization_matrix_and_predictive_inputs_to_solve_a_tracking_problem_under_disturbances","257351951_Composite_adaptive_fuzzy_H_tracking_control_of_uncertain_nonlinear_systems","236055290_Probabilistic_DHP_Adaptive_Critic_for_Nonlinear_Stochastic_Control_Systems","232087294_Output_feedback_direct_adaptive_neural_network_control_for_uncertain_SISO_nonlinear_systems_using_a_fuzzy_estimator_of_the_control_error","224168344_Quaternion-Based_Adaptive_Output_Feedback_Attitude_Control_of_Spacecraft_Using_Chebyshev_Neural_Networks","221936165_Adaptive_Approximation_Based_Control-Unifying_Neural_Fuzzy_and_Traditional_Adaptive_Approximation_Approaches","221885178_Nonlinear_adaptive_flight_control_using_sliding_mode_online_learning","220467030_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Control_With_Guaranteed_Convergence_of_Optimal_Approximation_Error","23387245_Shared_Internal_Models_for_Feedforward_and_Feedback_Control","8433711_Feedforward_and_feedback_processes_in_motor_control","7349205_Contribution_of_Feedback_and_Feedforward_Strategies_to_Locomotor_Adaptations","5608673_Neural_Network_Approximation_of_Piecewise_Continuous_Functions_Application_to_Friction_Compensation","5596176_Use_of_an_artificial_neuroadaptive_robot_model_to_describe_adaptive_and_learning_motor_mechanisms_in_the_central_nervous_system","5589274_Adaptive_PositionForce_Control_of_Robot_Manipulators_without_Velocity_Measurements_Theory_and_Experimentation","3332843_Harmonic_Disturbance_Rejection_in_Tracking_Control_of_Euler-Lagrange_Systems_An_External_Model_Approach","3281952_Neural_Network_Control_of_Robot_Manipulators","3206755_Neural-fuzzy_control_system_for_robotic_manipulators","3032900_Lyapunov-Based_Tracking_Control_in_the_Presence_of_Uncertain_Nonlinear_Parameterizable_Friction","3031877_A_Continuous_Asymptotic_Tracking_Control_Strategy_for_Uncertain_Nonlinear_Systems","3023666_Deadzone_compensation_in_motion_control_systems_using_neural_networks"]}
