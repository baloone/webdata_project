{"id":"222672300_Routing_and_wavelength_assignment_by_partition_coloring","abstract":"The problem of routing and wavelength assignment in all-optical networks may be solved by a combined approach involving the computation of alternative routes for the lightpaths, followed by the solution of a partition colouring problem in a conflict graph. A new tabu search heuristic is also proposed for the partition colouring problem, which may be viewed as an extension of the graph colouring problem. Computational experiments are reported, showing that the tabu search heuristic outperforms the best heuristic for partition colouring by approximately 20% in the average and illustrating that the new approach for the problem of routing and wavelength assignment is more robust than a well established heuristic for this problem.","authors":["Thiago Ferreira de Noronha","Celso C.
