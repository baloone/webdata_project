{"id":"323646774_Multi-oriented_text_detection_from_natural_scene_images_based_on_a_CNN_and_pruning_non-adjacent_graph_edges","abstract":"Due to the complex backgrounds, size variations, and changes in perspective and orientation in natural scene images, detecting multi-oriented text is a difficult problem that has recently attracted considerable attention from research communities. In this paper, we present a novel method that effectively and robustly detects multi-oriented text in natural scene images. First, the candidate characters are generated by an exhaustive segmentation-based method that can extract characters in arbitrary orientations. Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is employed to filter out the non-character regions; this model is also robust to arbitrary character orientations. Finally, text-line grouping is treated as a problem of pruning non-adjacent graph edges from a graph in which each vertex represents a character candidate region. To evaluate our algorithm, we compare it with other existing algorithms by performing experiments on three public datasets: ICDAR 2013, the Oriented Scene Text Dataset (OSTD) and USTB-SV1K. The results show that the proposed method handles any arbitrary text orientation well, and it achieves promising results on these three public datasets.","authors":["Yuanwang Wei","Wei Shen","Dan Zeng","Lihua Ye"],"meta":["March 2018Signal Processing Image Communication 64","DOI:10.1016/j.image.2018.02.016"],"references":["308834858_Symmetry-based_text_line_detection_in_natural_scenes","308277110_Detecting_Text_in_Natural_Image_with_Connectionist_Text_Proposal_Network","286945604_Scene_text_detection_and_recognition_recent_advances_and_future_trends","277553590_Robust_Scene_Text_Detection_with_Convolution_Neural_Network_Induced_MSER_Trees","277411157_Deep_Learning","262165758_Scene_Text_Localization_Using_Gradient_Local_Correlation","311610815_Multi-oriented_Text_Detection_with_Fully_Convolutional_Networks","308836750_Efficient_Scene_text_localization_and_recognition_with_local_character_refinement","291187265_ICDAR_2015_competition_on_Robust_Reading","282844224_Text-Attentional_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Scene_Text_Detection","280632074_Multi-Orientation_Scene_Text_Detection_with_Adaptive_Clustering","271454229_Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection","269280573_Reading_Text_in_the_Wild_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","263901792_MSER-based_Real-Time_Text_Detection_and_Tracking","261282766_Multi-script_Text_Extraction_from_Natural_Scenes","261282679_On_Combining_Multiple_Segmentations_in_Scene_Text_Recognition"]}
