Its vision is to better understand the world around us. In this paper, the specific feature transformation, feature selection and classifier algorithm used in the framework are studied and analyzed, and a cascade depth model is constructed. Through detailed analysis of the feature transformation, feature selection and classification methods used in the framework, an effective cascade depth model based on feature extraction and feature selection is successfully implemented, and the effectiveness of the proposed feature combination method is verified.","authors":["Hongwen Yan","Zhenyu Liu","Qingliang Cui"],"meta":["April 2020Evolutionary Intelligence","DOI:10.1007/s12065-020-00413-9"],"references":["324443992_BCDForest_A_boosting_cascade_deep_forest_model_towards_the_classification_of_cancer_subtypes_based_on_gene_expression_data","324089533_Diabetes_classification_model_based_on_boosting_algorithms","317212861_Feature_selection_based_on_graph_Laplacian_by_using_compounds_with_known_and_unknown_activities","315655695_Experimental_Identification_of_Hard_Data_Sets_for_Classification_and_Feature_Selection_Methods_with_Insights_on_Method_Selection","324761445_Fault_Feature_Selection_and_Diagnosis_of_Rolling_Bearings_Based_on_EEMD_and_Optimized_Elman_AdaBoost_Algorithm","322376461_An_Efficient_Feature_Generation_Approach_based_on_Deep_Learning_and_Feature_Selection_Techniques_for_traffic_classification","317833617_Breast_Cancer_Multi-classification_from_Histopathological_Images_with_Structured_Deep_Learning_Model","317203596_Feature_Interaction_Augmented_Sparse_Learning_for_Fast_Kinect_Motion_Detection","314623754_Graph_Classification_Based_on_Sparse_Graph_Feature_Selection_and_Extreme_Learning_Machine","314487964_Graph_classfication_based_on_sparse_graph_feature_selection_and_extreme_learning_machine","307604085_Accurate_De_Novo_Prediction_of_Protein_Contact_Map_by_Ultra-Deep_Learning_Model","303326745_Learning_rich_features_from_objectness_estimation_for_human_lying-pose_detection","314271540_A_Novel_Computer-Aided_Diagnosis_System_for_Breast_MRI_Based_on_Feature_Selection_and_Ensemble_Learning","307555846_Feature_Selection_and_Multiple_Kernel_Boosting_Framework_Based_on_PSO_with_Mutation_Mechanism_for_Hyperspectral_Classification","299474477_Bi-Level_Semantic_Representation_Analysis_for_Multimedia_Event_Detection"]}
