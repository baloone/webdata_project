{"id":"270894531_Large_Water-Hammer_Pressures_for_Column_Separation_in_Pipelines","abstract":"Experimental evidence of short-duration pressure pulses following the collapse of a vapor cavity at a valve have previously been presented in the literature (Yamaguchi and Ichikawa 1976; Yamaguchi et al. 1977; Martin 1983; Simpson 1986; Simpson and Wylie 1987). This paper investigates the variation of magnitude and shape of short-duration pressure pulses for a simple reservoir-valve system connected by a hypothetical frictionless pipe. Details of the mechanism for the occurrence of a short -duration pressure pulse are presented. The discrete vapor-cavity numerical model is used to analyse the pipe system during column separation events for different initial steady-state velocities. This model has been described in detail in earlier publications (Wylie and Streeter 1983; Simpson and Wylie 1989).","authors":["Angus R. Simpson","E.
