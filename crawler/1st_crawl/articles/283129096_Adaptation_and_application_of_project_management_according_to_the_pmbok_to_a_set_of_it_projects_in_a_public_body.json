It has evolved into a key role for the success of any project. Besides the PMI (Project Management Institute) already offers several versions of its guide: Project Management Body Of Knowledge PMBOK. Thus, this guide is fast becoming an indispensable tool for practitioners in all organizations and sectors. The main focus of the article is reserved for analyzing and modeling the PMBOK in order to reach a uniform model of project management. The obtained model will be projected on a set of projects within a Moroccan public department. Letâ€™s recall that the PMBoK defines the project management in terms of: integration, scope, time, cost, quality, human resources, communication, risk, procurement and the stakeholders of the project.
