{"id":"327762708_LiDAR-Video_Driving_Dataset_Learning_Driving_Policies_Effectively","abstract":"Learning autonomous-driving policies is one of the most challenging but promising tasks for computer vision. Most researchers believe that should combine cameras, video recorders, and laser scanners to obtain real traffic. However, current approaches only learn from large-scale videos, due to the lack of benchmarks that consist of precise laser-scanner data. In this paper, we are the first to propose a LiDAR-Video dataset, which provides large-scale high-quality point clouds scanned by a Velodyne laser, videos recorded by a dashboard camera and standard driversâ€™ behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that extra depth information help networks to determine driving policies indeed.","authors":["Jingkang Wang","Yiping Chen","Jonathan Li","Cewu Lu"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2018.00615","Conference: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018"],"references":["322749812_SegNet_A_Deep_Convolutional_Encoder-Decoder_Architecture_for_Image_Segmentation","317754272_Urban_3D_segmentation_and_modelling_from_street_view_images_and_LiDAR_point_clouds","311411614_PointNet_Deep_Learning_on_Point_Sets_for_3D_Classification_and_Segmentation","308034527_Long-term_recurrent_convolutional_networks_for_visual_recognition_and_description","301880609_The_Cityscapes_Dataset_for_Semantic_Urban_Scene_Understanding","320971948_End-to-End_Learning_of_Driving_Models_from_Large-Scale_Video_Datasets","311609285_Monocular_3D_Object_Detection_for_Autonomous_Driving","311240888_1_year_1000_km_The_Oxford_RobotCar_dataset","305809416_Learning_a_Driving_Simulator","304409510_DeepDriving_Learning_Affordance_for_Direct_Perception_in_Autonomous_Driving"]}
