{"id":"333227582_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Generalizations_of_Directed_Feedback_Vertex_Set","abstract":"The Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) problem takes as input a directed graph G and seeks a smallest vertex set S that hits all cycles in G. This is one of Karp’s 21 -complete problems. Resolving the parameterized complexity status of DFVS was a long-standing open problem until Chen et al. in 2008 showed its fixed-parameter tractability via a -time algorithm, where . Here we show fixed-parameter tractability of two generalizations of DFVS:Find a smallest vertex set S such that every strong component of has size at most s: we give an algorithm solving this problem in time .Find a smallest vertex set S such that every non-trivial strong component of is 1-out-regular: we give an algorithm solving this problem in time . Find a smallest vertex set S such that every strong component of has size at most s: we give an algorithm solving this problem in time . Find a smallest vertex set S such that every non-trivial strong component of is 1-out-regular: we give an algorithm solving this problem in time . We also solve the corresponding arc versions of these problems by fixed-parameter algorithms.","authors":["Alexander Göke","Dániel Marx","Matthias Mnich"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-17402-6_21","In book: Algorithms and Complexity, 11th International Conference, CIAC 2019, Rome, Italy, May 27–29, 2019, Proceedings (pp.249-261)"],"references":["316163264_Parameterized_Complexity_and_Approximability_of_Directed_Odd_Cycle_Transversal","309207166_A_2ell_k_Kernel_for_ell-Component_Order_Connectivity","227278349_Approximating_Minimum_Feedback_Sets_and_Multicuts_in_Directed_Graphs","220992929_Computing_the_Deficiency_of_Housing_Markets_with_Duplicate_Houses","220753072_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2718556_Divide-and-Conquer_Approximation_Algorithms_via_Spreading_Metrics","322218070_When_Recursion_is_Better_than_Iteration_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Acyclicity_with_Few_Error_Vertices","306376857_Linear_Kernels_for_Separating_a_Graph_into_Components_of_Bounded_Size","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","272194508_DAG-Width_and_Circumference_of_Digraphs","262391743_What's_Next_Future_Directions_in_Parameterized_Complexity","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","220618430_Beating_the_Random_Ordering_Is_Hard_Every_Ordering_CSP_Is_Approximation_Resistant","220442059_Packing_Directed_Circuits_Fractionally","220151180_The_Directed_Subgraph_Homeomorphism_Problem","51942517_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_of_Directed_Multiway_Cut_Parameterized_by_the_Size_of_the_Cutset"]}
