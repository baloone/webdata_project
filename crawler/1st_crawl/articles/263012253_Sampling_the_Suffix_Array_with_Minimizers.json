{"id":"263012253_Sampling_the_Suffix_Array_with_Minimizers","abstract":"Sampling (evenly) the suffixes from the suffix array is an old idea trading\nthe pattern search time for reduced index space. A few years ago Claude et al.\nshowed an alphabet sampling scheme allowing for more efficient pattern searches\ncompared to the sparse suffix array, for long enough patterns. A drawback of\ntheir approach is the requirement that sought patterns need to contain at least\none character from the chosen subalphabet. In this work we propose an\nalternative suffix sampling approach with only a minimum pattern length as a\nrequirement, which seems more convenient in practice. Experiments show that our\nalgorithm achieves competitive time-space tradeoffs on most standard benchmark\ndata.","authors":["Szymon Grabowski","Marcin Raniszewski"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-23826-5_28","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval"],"references":["263736737_KMC_2_Fast_and_resource-frugal_k-mer_counting","262604438_Two_simple_full-text_indexes_based_on_the_suffix_array","260443015_Wood_DE_Salzberg_SL_Kraken_Ultrafast_metagenomic_sequence_classification_using_exact_alignment_Genome_Biol_15_R46","259824884_On_the_Representation_of_De_Bruijn_Graphs","314816191_Deterministic_sorting_in_O_n_log_log_n_time_and_linear_space","287273564_Faster_sparse_suffix_sorting","270004933_Disk-based_compression_of_data_from_genome_sequencing","262164659_Memory_efficient_minimum_substring_partitioning","261534503_Optimized_succinct_data_structures_for_massive_data","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms"]}
