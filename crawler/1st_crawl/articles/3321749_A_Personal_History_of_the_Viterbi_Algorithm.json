{"id":"3321749_A_Personal_History_of_the_Viterbi_Algorithm","abstract":"While teaching information theory at University of California in Los Angeles, Andrew Viterbi developed a new nonsequential decoding algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm sprang from his desire to simplify and clarify the material taught in an information theory course. Later on the algorithm came to be known as the Viterbi algorithm, a computationally efficient technique for determining the most probable path taken through a Markov graph. Its earliest application was the maximum likelihood decoding of convolutionally coded digital sequences transmitted over a noise channel. Over the years, other applications ensued and eventually, the algorithm became a standard.","authors":["Andrew J.
