{"id":"308963147_Big_Red_A_Development_Environment_for_Bigraphs","abstract":"We present Big Red, a visual editor for bigraphs and bigraphical reactive systems, based upon Eclipse. The editor integrates with several existing bigraph tools to permit simulation and reachability analysis of bigraphical models. We give a brief introduction to the bigraphs formalism, and show how these concepts manifest within the tool using a small motivating example developed in Big Red. We go on to outline its architecture and implementation, and comment on possible future work.","authors":["Alexander John Faithfull","Gian Perrone","Thomas Troels Hildebrandt"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.14279/tuj.eceasst.61.835.829"],"references":[]}
