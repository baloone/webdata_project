{"id":"328099260_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_Construction_of_the_Equation_Tree_Automaton","abstract":"Champarnaud et al., and Khorsi et al. show how to compute the equation automaton of a word regular expression Evia the C-continuations. Kuske and Meinecke extend the computation of the equation automaton to a regular tree expression E over a ranked alphabet Σ and produce a O(R⋅|E|2) time and space complexity algorithm, where R is the maximal rank of a symbol occurring in Σ and |E| is the size of the syntax tree of E. In this paper, we give a full description of an algorithm based on the acyclic minimization of Revuz in order to compute the pseudo-continuations from the C-continuations. Our algorithm, which is performed in O(|Q|⋅|E|) time and space complexity, where |Q| is the number of states of the produced automaton, is more efficient than the one obtained by Kuske and Meinecke since |Q|≤|E|. Moreover, our algorithm is an output-sensitive algorithm, i.e. the complexity of which is based on the size of the produced automaton.","authors":["Ludovic Mignot","Nadia Ouali-Sebti","Djelloul Ziadi"],"meta":["September 2018International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science 29(06):951-978","DOI:10.1142/S0129054118500156","Project: Tree automata from regular expressions"],"references":["259875009_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_Equation_Tree_Automaton_via_the_k-C-Continuations","307174777_Tree_Automata_Techniques_and_Applications","265990523_From_Regular_Tree_Expression_to_Position_Tree_Automaton","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","223254011_Follow_automata","223122265_Minimisation_of_acyclic_deterministic_automata_in_linear_time","222734141_Partial_derivatives_of_regular_expressions_and_finite_automaton_constructions","222667898_Canonical_derivatives_partial_derivatives_and_finite_automaton_constructions","220980282_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","220657842_Fast_equation_automaton_computation"]}
