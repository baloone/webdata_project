{"id":"326113498_FITTS'_LAW_AS_AN_EDUCATION_RESOURCE_FOR_HUMAN-COMPUTER_INTERACTION_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_CURRICULA","abstract":"Fitts' Law is, more often than not, thought of as standard knowledge in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. However, in many occasions, interface components are being built by professionals with little or no knowledge of HCI principles (e.g., software menus are often being built by software developers with no designer input). How much appreciation of Fitts' Law exists among developers, and how does it affect our collaboration with them and the software they build and we use? To help answer this question, a survey among 65 designers and developers was conducted, as well as an analysis of the Computer Science undergraduate curricula from 94 internationally high-ranked universities. The contribution of this paper is twofold: firstly, treating Fitts' Law as an Open Educational Resource and, secondly, the analysis identified gaps that extend beyond HCI Education and fall in the sphere of Epistemology.","authors":["Evangelos Kapros"],"meta":["July 2018"],"references":["256440602_Teaching_Human_Factors_to_Graduate_and_Undergraduate_Computer_Science_Students","237306274_A_Systematic_Approach_to_Usability_Practices_in_Computer_Science_Curricula","221514071_Fitts'_Law_as_an_Explicit_TimeError_Trade-Off","220244986_Gazing_and_frowning_as_a_new_human-computer_interaction_technique","220040704_Transdisciplinary_Education_and_Collaboration","262292459_Targeting_the_Fitts_Law","221517177_A_Comparison_of_Three_Selection_Techniques_for_Touchpads","221516252_Bullseye_when_Fitts'_Law_Doesn't_Fit","221515818_The_effects_of_intended_use_on_target_acquisition","221513951_Only_one_Fitts'_law_formula_please","213799223_Fitts'_Law_as_a_Research_and_Design_Tool_in_Human-Computer_Interaction","21752413_The_Information_Capacity_of_the_Human_Motor_System_in_Controlling_the_Amplitude_of_Movement","2451438_March_1996Teaching_Human_Computer_Interaction_to_Programmers"]}
