{"id":"340603020_Fractional-Order_Models_for_Biochemical_Processes","abstract":"Biochemical processes present complex mechanisms and can be described by various computational models. Complex systems present a variety of problems, especially the loss of intuitive understanding. The present work uses fractional-order calculus to obtain mathematical models for erythritol and mannitol synthesis. The obtained models are useful for both prediction and process optimization. The models present the complex behavior of the process due to the fractional order, without losing the physical meaning of gain and time constants. To validate each obtained model, the simulation results were compared with experimental data. In order to highlight the advantages of fractional-order models, comparisons with the corresponding integer-order models are presented.","authors":["Eva Henrietta Dulf","Dan Cristian Vodnar","Alex Danku","Cristina Muresan"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.3390/fractalfract4020012"],"references":["329301234_Modeling_tool_using_neural_networks_for_L-lactic_acid_production_by_pellet-form_Rhizopus_oryzae_NRRL_395_on_biodiesel_crude_glycerol","322562476_Sources_of_Added_Sugars_in_Young_Children_Adolescents_and_Adults_with_Low_and_High_Intakes_of_Added_Sugars","334262031_Biochemistry_and_use_of_soybean_isoflavones_in_functional_food_development","333854393_A_review_of_polyols_-_biotechnological_production_food_applications_regulation_labeling_and_health_effects","331281105_A_review_of_food_reformulation_of_baked_products_to_reduce_added_sugar_intake","328749295_Isoflavone_aglycones_enrichment_in_soybean_sourdough_bread_fermented_by_Lactic_acid_bacteria_strains_isolated_from_traditional_Qu_starters_effects_on_in-vitro_gastrointestinal_digestion_nutritional_an","327477400_Analytical_solution_of_the_time_fractional_diffusion_equation_and_fractional_convection-diffusion_equation","327306150_Fractional_derivatives_with_no-index_law_property_Application_to_chaos_and_statistics","325787609_Analysis_of_reaction_diffusion_system_via_a_new_fractional_derivative_with_non-singular_kernel","319155820_Numerical_approximation_of_Riemann-Liouville_definition_of_fractional_derivative_From_Riemann-Liouville_to_Atangana-Baleanu_Atangana_and_Gomez-Aguilar"]}
