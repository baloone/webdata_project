{"id":"282692184_On_the_Uniform_Computational_Content_of_the_Baire_Category_Theorem","abstract":"We study the uniform computational content of different versions of the Baire\nCategory Theorem in the Weihrauch lattice. The Baire Category Theorem can be\nseen as a pigeonhole principle that states that a complete (i.e., \"large\")\nmetric space cannot be decomposed into countably many nowhere dense (i.e.,\n\"small\") pieces. The Baire Category Theorem is an illuminating example of a\ntheorem that can be used to demonstrate that one classical theorem can have\nseveral different computational interpretations. For one, we distinguish two\ndifferent logical versions of the theorem, where one can be seen as the\ncontrapositive form of the other one. The first version aims to find an\nuncovered point in the space, given a sequence of nowhere dense closed sets.\nThe second version aims to find the index of a closed set that is somewhere\ndense, given a sequence of closed sets that cover the space. Even though the\ntwo statements behind these versions are equivalent to each other in classical\nlogic, they are not equivalent in intuitionistic logic and likewise they\nexhibit different computational behavior in the Weihrauch lattice. Besides this\nlogical distinction, we also consider different ways how the sequence of closed\nsets is \"given\". Essentially, we can distinguish between positive and negative\ninformation on closed sets. We discuss all the four resulting versions of the\nBaire Category Theorem. Somewhat surprisingly it turns out that the difference\nin providing the input information can also be expressed with the jump\noperation. Finally, we also relate the Baire Category Theorem to notions of\ngenericity and computably comeager sets.","authors":["Vasco Brattka","Matthew Hendtlass","Alexander P.
