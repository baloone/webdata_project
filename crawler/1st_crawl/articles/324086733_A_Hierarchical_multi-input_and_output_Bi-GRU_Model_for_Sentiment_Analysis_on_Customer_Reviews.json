{"id":"324086733_A_Hierarchical_multi-input_and_output_Bi-GRU_Model_for_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Customer_Reviews","abstract":"Multi-label sentiment classification on customer reviews is a practical challenging task in Natural Language Processing. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-input and output model based bi-directional recurrent neural network, which both considers the semantic and lexical information of emotional expression. Our model applies two independent Bi-GRU layer to generate part of speech and sentence representation. Then the lexical information is considered via attention over output of softmax activation on part of speech representation. In addition, we combine probability of auxiliary labels as feature with hidden layer to capturing crucial correlation between output labels. The experimental result shows that our model is computationally efficient and achieves breakthrough improvements on customer reviews dataset.","authors":["Liujie Zhang","Yanquan Zhou","Xiuyu Duan","Ruiqi Chen"],"meta":["March 2018IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 322(6):062007","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/322/6/062007"],"references":["311990867_Neural_Sentiment_Classification_with_User_and_Product_Attention","285648161_Approaches_for_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Twitter_A_State-of-Art_study","273859036_Multi-Label_Classification_An_Overview","273067823_Improved_Semantic_Representations_From_Tree-Structured_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks","319770184_Speech_Recognition_With_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","308628815_A_Hierarchical_ML-kNN_Method_for_Complex_Emotion_Analysis_on_Customer_Reviews","291997126_Data_Mining_and_Knowledge_Discovery_Handbook","290537755_Simultaneously_leveraging_output_and_task_structures_for_multiple-output_regression","270877509_Learning_Sentiment-Specific_Word_Embedding_for_Twitter_Sentiment_Classification","265052545_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification"]}
