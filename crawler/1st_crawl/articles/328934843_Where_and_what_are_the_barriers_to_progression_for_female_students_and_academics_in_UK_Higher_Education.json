{"id":"328934843_Where_and_what_are_the_barriers_to_progression_for_female_students_and_academics_in_UK_Higher_Education","abstract":"Gender equality is a high priority for UK universities with research showing that female academics do not progress at the same rate as their male counterparts. Research has been carried out to analyse data across the academic career pathway, from undergraduate student to professorial level, using Uni A as a case study. This research has taken a deductive approach, testing the Leaky Pipeline Theory in Social Science departments, making use of survey data and using qualitative data to interpret quantitative findings. Results showed that there were four stages in the academic career pathway in which women exit at a greater rate than men. This has been shown not to result from a bias in shortlisting or interview, but due to a lack of female applications for progression compared to male applications. To improve this position, UK universities must facilitate part-time working in senior academic positions, recognise talent and empower women to apply for promotion.","authors":["Oliver Cooper"],"meta":["November 2018Perspectives 23(1):1-8","DOI:10.1080/13603108.2018.1544176"],"references":["254307686_Renewing_strategic_planning_in_universities_at_a_time_of_uncertainty","233284383_Mainstreaming_Gender_Equality_in_Science_in_the_European_Union_The_'ETAN_Report'","228771200_Transparency_in_Academic_Recruitment_A_Problematic_Tool_for_Gender_Equality","228384649_Women_and_Science_Careers_Leaky_Pipeline_or_Gender_Filter","225152688_What_Do_We_Know_About_Glass_Ceiling_Effects_A_Taxonomy_and_Critical_Review_to_Inform_Higher_Education_Research","318726898_The_leaking_pipeline_Women_postgraduate_and_early_career_researchers_in_australia","294921812_The_'Leaky_Pipeline'","289897369_The_progression_of_women_beyond_the_glass_ceiling","284516745_Differentiation_of_English_universities_the_impact_of_policy_reforms_in_driving_a_more_diverse_higher_education_landscape","275997059_The_Sexuality_of_Organization_In_The_Sexuality_of_Organization","275247147_Diversity_in_leadership","274183019_Women_and_Men_at_Work","263378734_Managing_the_Tensions_between_Maintaining_Academic_Standards_and_the_Commercial_Imperative_in_a_UK_Private_Sector_Higher_Education_Institution","250961857_Leadership_and_the_Glass_Ceiling_Gender_and_Ethnic_Group_Influences_on_Leader_Behaviors_at_Middle_and_Executive_Managerial_Levels","250145323_Leaking_Pipeline_Issues_Impacting_LatinoA_College_Student_Retention","249104798_Academe's_Glass_Ceiling_Societal_ProfessionalOrganizational_and_Institutional_Barriers_to_the_Career_Advancement_of_Academic_Women","243461626_Women_Decision_Making_and_Academia_An_Unholy_Alliance","242425059_How_to_Choose_a_Leadership_Pattern","237935626_Clearing_the_way_for_gender_balance_in_the_management_of_the_UK_financial_services_industry_Enablers_and_barriers","235323163_'The_Problem_of_Women's_Assimilation_into_UK_Engineering_Cultures_Can_Critical_Mass_Work'","233185757_The_Invisible_Workers","232603739_Women_and_Minorities_in_Management","229595263_Shatter_the_glass_ceiling_Women_may_make_better_managers","227620437_Gender_Status_and_Leadership","41199337_That's_not_how_I_see_it_Female_and_male_perspectives_on_the_academic_role","13156131_Creating_a_culture_of_change"]}
