{"id":"337055894_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_the_Application_of_Hashing_Encryption_Algorithms_for_MD5_SHA-1_and_SHA-512","abstract":"This study compares different hashing encryption algorithms and provides several suggestions about how to choose different hashing encryption algorithms for particular cases. This paper presents three different kinds of hashing encryption algorithms. The author introduces the fundamental conceptions of these algorithms and their application. The author also computes some significant factors in computer science and compares these algorithms by mathematical quantity computing data. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of hashing encryption algorithms and proposes its potential value in the future.","authors":["Sihan Long"],"meta":["October 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1314(1):012210","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1314/1/012210"],"references":["323806050_A_comparative_study_of_Message_Digest_5MD5_and_SHA256_algorithm","225144845_Comparative_Analysis_of_the_Hardware_Implementations_of_Hash_Functions_SHA-1_and_SHA-512","247931156_Algorithms_in_C_-_part_5_graph_algorithms_3_ed","242391317_The_MD5_Message-digest_Algorithm","225591089_Collisions_for_the_compression_function_of_MD5","225035603_Introduction_to_Algorithms_Second_Edition","224398575_Choosing_Best_Hashing_Strategies_and_Hash_Functions","221355169_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220458748_Analysis_and_detection_of_errors_in_implementation_of_SHA-512_algorithms_on_FPGAs","2526010_In-memory_Hash_Tables_for_Accumulating_Text_Vocabularies"]}
