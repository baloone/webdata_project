Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 cases and deaths on the change in county-level voting for Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy. We find that COVID-19 cases negatively affected Trump’s vote share. The estimated effect appears strongest in urban counties, in states without stay-at-home orders, in swing states, and in states that Trump won in 2016. A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower. We also find some evidence that COVID-19 incidence had a positive effect on voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency.","authors":["Leonardo Baccini","Abel Brodeur","Stephen Weymouth"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Population Economics 34(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00148-020-00820-3"],"references":["347290521_Explaining_Governors'_Response_to_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_in_the_United_States","346487483_Fatalities_from_COVID-19_are_reducing_Americans'_support_for_Republicans_at_every_level_of_federal_office","345466403_A_Counterfactual_Economic_Analysis_of_Covid-19_Using_a_Threshold_Augmented_Multi-Country_Model","345221437_Partisan_differences_in_physical_distancing_are_linked_to_health_outcomes_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic","344455830_Too_afraid_to_vote_The_effects_of_COVID-19_on_voting_behaviour","356299628_The_Short-Term_Economic_Consequences_of_Covid-19_Exposure_to_Disease_Remote_Work_and_Government_Response","352075723_Exposure_to_air_pollution_and_COVID-19_mortality_in_the_United_States","348689334_Tariffs_As_Electoral_Weapons_The_Political_Geography_of_the_US-China_Trade_War","346454691_Methods_Matter_P-Hacking_and_Publication_Bias_in_Causal_Analysis_in_Economics","344837583_Corona_Politics_The_Cost_of_Mismanaging_Pandemics","343897209_Identifying_policy_challenges_of_COVID-19_in_hardly_reliable_data_and_judging_the_success_of_lockdown_measures","343754346_COVID-19_outbreak_social_response_and_early_economic_effects_a_global_VAR_analysis_of_cross-country_interdependencies","343558905_Electoral_Repercussions_of_a_Pandemic_Evidence_from_the_2009_H1N1_Outbreak","343491245_Polarization_and_Public_Health_Partisan_Differences_in_Social_Distancing_during_the_Coronavirus_Pandemic","343453610_Lockdown_and_Voting_Behaviour_A_Natural_Experiment_on_Postponed_Elections_during_the_COVID-19_Pandemic"]}
