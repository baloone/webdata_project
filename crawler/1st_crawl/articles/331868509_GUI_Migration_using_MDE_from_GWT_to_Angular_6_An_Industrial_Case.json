{"id":"331868509_GUI_Migration_using_MDE_from_GWT_to_Angular_6_An_Industrial_Case","abstract":"â€”During the evolution of an application, it happens\nthat developers must change the programming language. In\nthe context of a collaboration with Berger-Levrault, a major\nIT company, we are working on the migration of a GWT\napplication to Angular. We focus on the GUI aspect of this\nmigration which, even if both frameworks are web Graphical\nUser Interface (GUI) frameworks, is made difficult because they\nuse different programming languages and different organization\nschema. Such migration is complicated by the fact that the new\napplication must be able to mimic closely the visual aspect of the\nold one so that the users of the application are not disrupted.\nWe propose an approach in four steps that uses a meta-model to\nrepresent the GUI at a high abstraction level. We evaluated this\napproach on an application comprising 470 Java (GWT) classes\nrepresenting 56 pages. We are able to model all the web pages\nof the application and 93% of the widgets they contain, and we\nsuccessfully migrated 26 out of 39 pages (66%). We give examples\nof the migrated pages, both successful and not.","authors":["Benoit Verhaeghe","Anne Etien","Nicolas Anquetil","Abderrahmane Seriai"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.1109/SANER.2019.8667989","Conference: 2019 IEEE 26th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)"],"references":["307607113_Java_Swing_Modernization_Approach_Complete_Abstract_Representation_based_on_Static_and_Dynamic_Analysis","270103675_Model-driven_reverse_engineering_of_legacy_graphical_user_interfaces","267780693_Reverse_Engineering_of_Graphical_User_Interfaces","265428652_MSE_and_FAMIX_30_an_Interexchange_Format_and_Source_Code_Model_Family","221560402_The_story_of_Moose_an_agile_reengineering_environment","320603156_White-box_Modernization_of_Legacy_Applications_The_Oracle_Forms_Case_Study","303972105_Automatic_Detection_of_GUI_Design_Smells_The_Case_of_Blob_Listener","261199437_Reverse_Engineering_iOS_Mobile_Applications","241622932_Reverse-engineering_user_interfaces_to_facilitateporting_to_and_across_mobile_devices_and_platforms","224185190_Extreme_maintenance_Transforming_Delphi_into_C"]}
