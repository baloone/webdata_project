{"id":"311749967_Perceptive_and_objective_evaluation_of_calibrated_room_acoustic_simulation_auralizations","abstract":"Recently, auralizations have become more prevalent in architectural acoustics and virtual reality.\nHowever, there have been few studies examining the perceptual quality achievable by room acoustic\nsimulations and auralizations. Such studies have highlighted potential problems in creating perceptually\nequivalent simulations when compared to measured auralizations in terms of parameter\nestimation. In order to accomplish realistic auralizations, calibration of the geometrical acoustics\nmodel can be considered a necessary step. In situations where the studied space exists, well calibrated\nauralizations can be employed for multiple purposes, such as multi-modal virtual reality\nexplorations, studies of the acoustical influence of renovations, and historic research. Using this\ncase type as a base, a perceptual study evaluating state-of-the-art binaural auralizations has been\ncarried out. Three test sites of different complexity and acoustics were selected: the abbey church\nSaint-Germain-des-Prés, the cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris, and the Théatre de l’Athénée. Models\nwere calibrated according to omni-directional source-receiver measurements for reverberation and\nclarity parameters. In the subjective listening test, measured and simulated binaural auralizations\nwere compared according to eight acoustic perceptual attributes. Results showed that the methodical\ncalibration procedure employed in combination with attention to control factors led to ecologically/\nperceptually valid auralizations.","authors":["Bart Postma","Brian F G Katz"],"meta":["December 2016The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 140(6):4326-4337","DOI:10.1121/1.4971422"],"references":["308097800_Augmented_auralization_Complementing_auralizations_with_immersive_virtual_reality_technologies","308097722_Acoustics_of_Notre-Dame_cathedral_de_Paris","303540104_Dynamic_voice_directivity_in_room_acoustic_auralizations","283457384_Calibrated_auralization_simulation_of_the_abbey_of_Saint-Germain-des-Pres_for_historical_study","236663933_Comparison_of_sound_field_measurements_and_predictions_in_coupled_volumes_between_numerical_methods_and_scale_model_measurements","236213215_Directivity_measurements_of_the_singing_voice","236169457_Evaluation_of_the_Geometry-Based_Parametric_Auralization","236169416_Rays_or_Waves_Understanding_the_Strengths_and_Weaknesses_of_Computational_Room_Acoustics_Modeling_Techniques","233598123_Validation_of_the_Auralization_Technique_Comparative_Speech-Intelligibility_Tests_in_Real_and_Virtual_Classrooms","228954144_Fogg_Art_Museum_Lecture_Room_A_calibrated_recreation_of_the_birthplace_of_Room_Acoustics","5324370_Recording_of_anechoic_symphony_music","301904465_Calculating_Reverberation_Time_from_Impulse_Responses_A_Comparison_of_Software_Implementations","288440546_International_round_robin_on_room_acoustical_computer_simulations","282894528_Creation_and_calibration_method_of_acoustical_models_for_historic_virtual_reality_auralizations","263211983_Concert_and_Opera_Halls_How_They_Sound","236213230_International_Round_Robin_on_Room_Acoustical_Impulse_Response_Analysis_Software_2004","233669928_A_Comparison_of_Subjective_Assessments_of_Recorded_Music_and_Computer_Simulated_Auralizations_in_Two_Auditoria","233636034_Report_on_the_3rd_Round_Robin_on_Room_Acoustical_Computer_Simulation_-_Part_II_Calculations","233591107_Report_on_the_3rd_Round_Robin_on_Room_Acoustical_Computer_Simulation_-_Part_I_Measurements","233569251_A_Comparison_of_Room_Simulation_Software_-_The_2nd_Round_Robin_on_Room_Acoustical_Computer_Simulation","215514670_Auralization_Fundamentals_of_Acoustics_Modeling_Simulation_Algorithms_and_Acoustic_Virtual_Reality"]}
