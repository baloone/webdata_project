{"id":"291412017_Modelling_and_Measurement_of_Competencies_in_Computer_Science_Education","abstract":"As a result of the Bologna reform of educational systems in\nEurope the outcome orientation of learning processes, competence-oriented\ndescriptions of the curricula and competence-oriented assessment\nprocedures became standard also in Computer Science Education\n(CSE). The following keynote addresses important issues of shaping\na CSE competence model especially in the area of informatics system\ncomprehension and object-oriented modelling. Objectives and research\nmethodology of the project MoKoM (Modelling and Measurement\nof Competences in CSE) are explained. Firstly, the CSE competence\nmodel was derived based on theoretical concepts and then secondly the\nmodel was empirically examined and refined using expert interviews.\nFurthermore, the paper depicts the development and examination of\na competence measurement instrument, which was derived from the\ncompetence model. Therefore, the instrument was applied to a large\nsample of students at the gymnasiumâ€™s upper class level. Subsequently,\nefforts to develop a competence level model, based on the retrieved empirical\nresults and on expert ratings are presented. Finally, further demands\non research on competence modelling in CSE will be outlined.","authors":["Johannes Magenheim","Sigrid Schubert","Niclas Schaper"],"meta":["January 2015"],"references":[]}
