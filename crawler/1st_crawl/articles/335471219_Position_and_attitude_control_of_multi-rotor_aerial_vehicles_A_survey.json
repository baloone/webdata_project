{"id":"335471219_Position_and_attitude_control_of_multi-rotor_aerial_vehicles_A_survey","abstract":"Motion control theory applied to multi-rotor aerial vehicles (MAVs) has gained attention with the recent increase in the processing power of computers, which are now able to perform the calculations needed for this technique, and with lower cost of sensors and actuators. Control algorithms of this kind are applied to the position and the attitude of MAVs. In this paper, we present a review of recent developments in position control and attitude control of multi-rotor aerial robots systems. We also point out the growth of related research, starting with the boom in multi-rotor unmanned aerial robotics that began after 2010, and we discuss reported field applications and future challenges of the control problem described here. The objective of this survey is to provide a unified and accessible presentation, placing the classical model of a multi-rotor aerial vehicle and the proposed control approaches into a proper context, and to form a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in linear/nonlinear position, altitude or attitude control applied to MAVs. Finally, the contribution of this work is an attempt to present a comprehensive review of recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and most successful works from the state-of-the-art.","authors":["Tiago P.
