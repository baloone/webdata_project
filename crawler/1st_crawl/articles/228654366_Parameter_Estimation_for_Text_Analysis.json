{"id":"228654366_Parameter_Estimation_for_Text_Analysis","abstract":"Presents parameter estimation methods common with discrete proba-bility distributions, which is of particular interest in text modeling. Starting with maximum likelihood, a posteriori and Bayesian estimation, central concepts like conjugate distributions and Bayesian networks are reviewed. As an application, the model of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is explained in detail with a full derivation of an approximate inference algorithm based on Gibbs sampling, in-cluding a discussion of Dirichlet hyperparameter estimation. Finally, analysis methods of LDA models are discussed.","authors":["Gregor Heinrich"],"meta":["January 2005"],"references":["235357425_Bayes-Ball_The_Rational_Pastime_for_Determining_Irrelevance_andRequisite_Information_in_Belief_Networks_and_Influence_Diagrams","229100766_Rao-Blackwellisation_of_Sampling_Schemes","221620547_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","220343825_Hofmann_T_Unsupervised_Learning_by_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Analysis_Machine_Learning_421-2_177-196","4742259_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","229036596_Comparing_Clusterings","222821252_Modeling_individual_differences_using_Dirichlet_processes","49250510_Topic_and_Role_Discovery_in_Social_Networks_with_Experiments_on_Enron_and_Academic_Email","2850032_Expectation-Propagation_for_the_Generative_Aspect_Model"]}
