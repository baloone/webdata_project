{"id":"268658265_Mumford_and_Shah_Model_and_Its_Applications_to_Image_Segmentation_and_Image_Restoration","abstract":"We present in this chapter an overview of the Mumford and Shah model for image segmentation. We discuss its various formulations, some of its properties, the mathematical framework, and several approximations. We also present numerical algorithms and segmentation results using the Ambrosio-Tortorelli phase-field approximations on the one hand, and using the level set formulations on the other hand. Several applications of the Mumford-Shah problem to image restoration are also presented.","authors":["Leah Bar","Tony F.
