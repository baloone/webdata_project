To evaluate the advantages of our proposed method, we compared the performance of our model with industry-standard machine learning approaches. We enrolled 6,701 individuals, which were randomly divided into training data sets (6030 participants) and test data sets (671 participants). We evaluated each diagnostic model in the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.\n\nResults: \nCompared with the seven conventional machine learning algorithms, the DNN showed higher stability and achieved the best accuracy with 0.88, which also showed good results for identifying normal (F1-score = 0.88), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (F1-score = 0.87), very mild dementia (VMD) (F1-score = 0.77) and Severe dementia (F1-score = 0.94).\n\nConclusion: \nThe deep neural network (DNN) classification model can effectively help doctors accurately screen patients who have normal cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), very mild dementia (VMD), mild dementia (Mild), moderate dementia (Moderate), and severe dementia (Severe).","authors":["Fubao Zhu","Xiaonan Li","Daniel McGonigle","Haipeng Tang"],"meta":["December 2019IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2959331"],"references":["331610908_NMD-12_A_new_machine-learning_derived_screening_instrument_to_detect_mild_cognitive_impairment_and_dementia","328794537_Deep_language_space_neural_network_for_classifying_mild_cognitive_impairment_and_Alzheimer-type_dementia","328597082_Identification_of_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment_From_Speech_in_Swedish_Using_Deep_Sequential_Neural_Networks","328056530_Deep_learning_based_low-cost_high-accuracy_diagnostic_framework_for_dementia_using_comprehensive_neuropsychological_assessment_profiles","336650626_FREEZING_OF_SPEECH_SINGLE_QUESTIONNAIRE_AS_A_SCREENING_TOOL_FOR_DEMENTIA_WITH_LEWY_BODIES","336644378_A_HISTORY-BASED_COMPUTERIZED_QUESTIONNAIRE_FOR_THE_DIAGNOSIS_OF_SEVERITY_AND_SUBTYPES_OF_DEMENTIA_DESIGN_AND_VERIFY","334989165_Preliminary_Study_of_the_History-based_Artificial_Intelligent_Clinical_Dementia_Diagnostic_System","330140408_Convolutional_Neural_Network_based_Alzheimer's_Disease_Classification_from_Magnetic_Resonance_Brain_Images","328371165_An_Informant-Based_Simple_Questionnaire_for_Language_Assessment_in_Neurodegenerative_Disorders","321826563_Dementia_burden_coming_into_focus"]}
