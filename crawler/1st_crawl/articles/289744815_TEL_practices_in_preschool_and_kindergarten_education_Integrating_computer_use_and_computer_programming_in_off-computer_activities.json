{"id":"289744815_TEL_practices_in_preschool_and_kindergarten_education_Integrating_computer_use_and_computer_programming_in_off-computer_activities","abstract":"The explosion in the use of computing in learning holds great potential for preschool education, and yet information on common educational practices with computers at the level of preschool education is scarce. This chapter shares two distinct goals: first, to provide context for the practitioner by providing a panorama of the information available on actual field practices and recommendations by official bodies from several countries regarding the inclusion of computing technology in the educational practice at the preschool and kindergarten levels; and second, to present a hands-on technical perspective on the matter of immersion of the computer in the daily practice of preschools in the form of a four-way guide, including the use of computer programming in this manner. At the end, a list of readings and activity suggestions is provided to help the reader put these ideas into practice.","authors":["Leonel Morgado"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.4018/978-1-59904-600-6.ch002","Project: ICEI - Internet em Contextos de Educação de Infância"],"references":["303856802_Video_games_and_the_future_of_learning","283152627_IBM_KidSmart_Early_Learning_programme_European_Evaluation_France_Germany_Italy_Portugal_Spain_and_UK_Final_report_June_2004","259668770_Framework_for_Computer_Programming_in_Preschool_and_Kindergarten","246829736_Minds_in_Play_Computer_Game_Design_As_A_Context_for_Children's_Learning","289963447_Principles_and_Standards_for_School_Mathematics","266441536_Microsoft_Office_PowerPoint_-_Das_Ideenbuch_fur_kreative_Prasentationen","260118471_The_role_and_potential_of_ICT_in_early_childhood_education_A_review_of_New_Zealand_and_international_literature_-_Prepared_for_the_Ministry_of_Education","253305936_Computers_and_Young_Children","249021714_Conversations_around_the_Large_Table_Building_Community_in_a_Portuguese_Public_Kindergarten","245754188_Computers_Networks_and_Education"]}
