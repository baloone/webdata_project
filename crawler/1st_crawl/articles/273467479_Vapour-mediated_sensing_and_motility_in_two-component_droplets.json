{"id":"273467479_Vapour-mediated_sensing_and_motility_in_two-component_droplets","abstract":"Controlling the wetting behaviour of liquids on surfaces is important for a variety of industrial applications such as water-repellent coatings and lubrication. Liquid behaviour on a surface can range from complete spreading, as in the 'tears of wine' effect, to minimal wetting as observed on a superhydrophobic lotus leaf. Controlling droplet movement is important in microfluidic liquid handling, on self-cleaning surfaces and in heat transfer. Droplet motion can be achieved by gradients of surface energy. However, existing techniques require either a large gradient or a carefully prepared surface to overcome the effects of contact line pinning, which usually limit droplet motion. Here we show that two-component droplets of well-chosen miscible liquids such as propylene glycol and water deposited on clean glass are not subject to pinning and cause the motion of neighbouring droplets over a distance. Unlike the canonical predictions for these liquids on a high-energy surface, these droplets do not spread completely but exhibit an apparent contact angle. We demonstrate experimentally and analytically that these droplets are stabilized by evaporation-induced surface tension gradients and that they move in response to the vapour emitted by neighbouring droplets. Our fundamental understanding of this robust system enabled us to construct a wide variety of autonomous fluidic machines out of everyday materials.","authors":["N J Cira","Adrien Benusiglio","Manu Prakash"],"meta":["March 2015Nature 519(7544)","DOI:10.1038/nature14272","SourcePubMed"],"references":["263899063_Clusters_asters_and_collective_oscillations_in_chemotactic_colloids","252204653_Capillarity_and_Wetting_Phenomena_Drops_Bubbles_Pearls_Waves","242018518_Patterning_droplets_with_durotaxis","240497108_Superhydrophobic_surfaces_From_structural_control_to_functional_application","221720307_Capillary_Flow_as_the_Cause_of_Ring_Stains_From_Dried_Liquid_Drops","12483087_Light-Driven_Motion_of_Liquids_on_a_Photoresponsive_Surface","12170402_Fast_Drop_Movements_Resulting_from_the_Phase_Change_on_a_Gradient_Surface","6004945_How_to_Make_Water_Run_Uphill","285599420_Capillarity_and_Wetting_Phenomena","280687035_Surface_tensions_of_propylene_glycol_water","279410266_Prevention_of_Liquid_Spreading_or_Creeping","277514483_Electrochemical_Principles_for_Active_Control_of_Liquids_on_Submillimeter_Scales","248831036_The_behaviour_of_liquid_drops_and_adsorbed_films_at_cleavage_surfaces_of_mica","245985462_Dynamic_Surface_Phenomena_in_the_Spontaneous_Spreading_of_Oils_on_Solids","243654519_Contact_Angle_Hysteresis_IV_Contact_Angle_Measurements_on_Heterogeneous_Surfaces","241725847_On_Certain_Curious_Motions_Observable_at_the_Surfaces_of_Wine_and_Other_Alcoholic_Liquors","240218859_RN_Resistance_of_Solid_Surfaces_to_Wetting_by_Water_Ind_Eng_Chem_28_988-994","234994135_Pollack_M_G_Fair_R_B_Shenderov_A_D_Electrowetting-based_actuation_of_liquid_droplets_for_microfluidic_applications_Appl_Phys_Lett_77_1725-1726","231675167_Influence_of_Surfactants_on_an_Evaporating_Drop_Fluorescence_Images_and_Particle_Deposition_Patterns","231671771_Motions_of_droplets_on_solid_surfaces_induced_by_chemical_or_thermal_gradients","231669558_Motions_of_droplets_on_hydrophobic_model_surfaces_induced_by_thermal_gradients","231533560_Surface_tensions_of_propylene_glycol_water","231127520_The_spreading_of_silicone_oil_on_horizontal_surfaces","230523912_Uber_die_Ausbreitung_der_Tropfen_einer_Flussigkeit_auf_der_Oberflache_einer_Anderen","229257589_Spreading_involving_the_marangoni_effect_Some_preliminary_results","225491965_Purity_of_the_sacred_lotus_or_escape_from_contamination_in_biological_surfaces","224709886_Marangoni_effects_in_the_spreading_of_liquid_mixtures_on_a_solid","52009732_Evaporation_of_a_Sessile_Droplet_on_a_Substrate","45588084_Quantitative_Experimental_Study_on_the_Transition_between_Fast_and_Delayed_Coalescence_of_Sessile_Droplets_with_Different_but_Completely_Miscible_Liquids","44681861_Quantitative_Experimental_Study_on_the_Transition_between_Fast_and_Delayed_Coalescence_of_Sessile_Droplets_with_Different_but_Completely_Miscible_Liquids","21087604_Actin_Microfilament_Dynamics_in_Locomoting_Cells","7901175_Analysis_of_the_Effects_of_Marangoni_Stresses_on_the_Microflow_in_an_Evaporating_Sessile_Droplet","5619330_Influence_of_Substrate_Conductivity_on_Circulation_Reversal_in_Evaporating_Drops","5334338_Delayed_Coalescence_Behavior_of_Droplets_with_Completely_Miscible_Liquids"]}
