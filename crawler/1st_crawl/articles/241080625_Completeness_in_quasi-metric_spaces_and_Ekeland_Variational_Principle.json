{"id":"241080625_Completeness_in_quasi-metric_spaces_and_Ekeland_Variational_Principle","abstract":"In this paper we prove a quasi-metric version of Ekeland Variational Principle and study its connections with the completeness properties of the underlying quasi-metric space. The equivalence with Caristi–Kirkʼs fixed point theorem and a proof of Clarkeʼs fixed point theorem for directional contractions within this framework are also considered.","authors":["Stefan Cobzas"],"meta":["May 2011Topology and its Applications 158(8):1073-1084","DOI:10.1016/j.topol.2011.03.003"],"references":["313608983_On_Caristi's_fixed_point_theorem_in_quasimetric_spaces","313173639_Bitopological_spaces","303342068_A_characterization_of_metric_completeness","292719693_Remarques_sur_les_problemes_variationnels_II","292719606_Direct_proof_of_Ekeland's_principle_in_locally_convex_Hausdorff_topolopgical_vector_spaces","269006282_Ekeland's_variational_principle_in_locally_convex_spaces_and_the_density_of_extremal_points","268660104_Brezis-Browder_Principle_and_Dependent_Choice","268651375_Caristi's_fixed_point_theorem_and_metric_convexity","268618138_Continuity_of_contractive_mappings_on_complete_quasi-metric_spaces","266831408_Ekeland_variational_principle_with_generalizations_and_variants","265992853_On_Asymmetric_Distances","265461880_Weak_topologies_on_asymmetric_normed_linear_spaces_and_non-asymptotic_criteria_in_the_theory_of_complexity_analysis_of_algorithms","265461808_On_Hausdorff_asymmetric_normed_linear_spaces","265463293_Fixed_point_theorems_for_quasi-metric_spaces","265461923_Convergence_precompactness_and_symmetry_in_quasi-uniform_spaces"]}
