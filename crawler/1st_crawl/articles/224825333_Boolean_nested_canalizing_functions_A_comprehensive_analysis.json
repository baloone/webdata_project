{"id":"224825333_Boolean_nested_canalizing_functions_A_comprehensive_analysis","abstract":"Boolean network models of molecular regulatory networks have been used\nsuccessfully in computational systems biology. The Boolean functions that\nappear in published models tend to have special properties, in particular the\nproperty of being nested canalizing, a concept inspired by the concept of\ncanalization in evolutionary biology. It has been shown that networks comprised\nof nested canalizing functions have dynamic properties that make them suitable\nfor modeling molecular regulatory networks, namely a small number of (large)\nattractors, as well as relatively short limit cycles.\nThis paper contains a detailed analysis of this class of functions, based on\na novel normal form as polynomial functions over the Boolean field. The concept\nof layer is introduced that stratifies variables into different classes\ndepending on their level of dominance. Using this layer concept a closed form\nformula is derived for the number of nested canalizing functions with a given\nnumber of variables. Additional metrics considered include Hamming weight, the\nactivity number of any variable, and the average sensitivity of the function.\nIt is also shown that the average sensitivity of any nested canalizing function\nis between 0 and 2. This provides a rationale for why nested canalizing\nfunctions are stable, since a random Boolean function in n variables has\naverage sensitivity n/2. The paper also contains experimental evidence that the\nlayer number is an important factor in network stability.","authors":["Yuan li","John O.
