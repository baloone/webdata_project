{"id":"328728209_Breast_cancer_histology_images_classification_Training_from_scratch_or_transfer_learning","abstract":"We demonstrated the ability of transfer learning in comparison with the fully-trained network on the histopathological imaging modality by considering three pre-trained networks: VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 and analyzed their behavior for magnification independent breast cancer classification. Concurrently, we examined the effect of training–testing data size on the performance of considered networks. A fine-tuned pre-trained VGG16 with logistic regression classifier yielded the best performance with 92.60% accuracy, 95.65% area under ROC curve (AUC), and 95.95% accuracy precision score (APS) for 90%–10% training–testing data splitting. Layer-wise fine-tuning and different weight initialization schemes can be a future aspect of this study. © 2018 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS)","authors":["Shallu Sharma","Dr. Rajesh Mehra"],"meta":["November 2018ICT Express 4(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.icte.2018.10.007","Project: Efficient Machine Learning Algorithms in Cancer Detection using Bio-medical Images"],"references":["322895764_Deep_Learning_for_Computer_Vision_A_Brief_Review","304158394_Breast_Cancer_Histopathological_Image_Classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","301921752_Do_deep_features_generalize_from_everyday_objects_to_remote_sensing_and_aerial_scenes_domains","297659797_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Medical_Image_Analysis_Fine_Tuning_or_Full_Training","322282188_Research_on_data_augmentation_for_image_classification_based_on_convolution_neural_networks","319952138_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_transfer_learning_for_computer_vision-based_data-driven_pavement_distress_detection","317833617_Breast_Cancer_Multi-classification_from_Histopathological_Images_with_Structured_Deep_Learning_Model","315187326_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Image_Analysis","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","296476972_Lung_Pattern_Classification_for_Interstitial_Lung_Diseases_Using_a_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network"]}
