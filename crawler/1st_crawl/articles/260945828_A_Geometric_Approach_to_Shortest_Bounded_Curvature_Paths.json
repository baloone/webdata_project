{"id":"260945828_A_Geometric_Approach_to_Shortest_Bounded_Curvature_Paths","abstract":"Consider two elements in the tangent bundle of the Euclidean plane\n$(x,X),(y,Y)\\in T{\\mathbb R}^2$. In this work we address the problem of\ncharacterizing the paths of bounded curvature and minimal length starting at\n$x$, finishing at $y$ and having tangents at these points $X$ and $Y$\nrespectively. This problem was first investigated in the late 50's by Lester\nDubins. In this note we present a constructive proof of Dubins' result giving\nspecial emphasis on the geometric nature of this problem.","authors":["Jos√© Ayala","Hyam Rubinstein"],"meta":["March 2014Communications in Analysis and Geometry 26(4)","DOI:10.4310/CAG.2018.v26.n4.a1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261029098_The_Classification_of_Homotopy_Classes_of_Bounded_Curvature_Paths","260992557_Shortest_Bounded_Curvature_Paths_with_Self_Intersections","260945601_Non-Uniqueness_of_the_Homotopy_Class_of_Bounded_Curvature_Paths","220977800_Constrained_Path_Optimisation_for_Underground_Mine_Layout","264960433_On_Curves_of_Minimal_Length_with_a_Constraint_on_Average_Curvature_and_with_Prescribed_Initial_and_Terminal_Positions_and_Tangents","243768016_On_regular_closed_curves_in_the_plane","238872788_Regular_Curves_on_Riemannian_Manifolds","230578932_On_curves_of_Minimal_lenght_with_a_constraint_on_average_curvature_and_with_prescribed_initial_and_terminal_positions_and_tangents","38347437_On_plane_curves_with_curvature"]}
