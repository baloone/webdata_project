A variety of modern many-body methods are employed, with exhaustive cross-checks and validation. Approaches for reaching the continuous space limit and the thermodynamic limit are investigated, proposed, and tested. The detailed comparisons provide a benchmark for assessing the current state of the art in many-body computation, and for the development of new methods. The ground-state energy per atom in the linear chain is accurately determined versus bondlength, with a confidence bound given on all uncertainties.","authors":["Mario Motta","David Ceperley","Garnet Kin-Lic Chan","John Gomez"],"meta":["May 2017Physical Review X 7(3)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevX.7.031059"],"references":["312031080_Stripe_order_in_the_underdoped_region_of_the_two-dimensional_Hubbard_model","309631727_Finite_temperature_quantum_embedding_theories_for_correlated_systems","308072270_Updated_core_libraries_of_the_ALPS_project","315695658_Polynomial_complexity_despite_the_fermionic_sign","315489087_Generalized_Self-Energy_Embedding_Theory","313673976_Sliced_Basis_Density_Matrix_Renormalization_Group_for_Electronic_Structure","311668865_Determinant_Diagrammatic_Monte_Carlo_in_the_Thermodynamic_Limit","310780456_Exploring_connections_between_statistical_mechanics_and_Green's_functions_for_realistic_systems_Temperature_dependent_electronic_entropy_and_internal_energy_from_a_self-consistent_second-order_Green's","309317338_Auxiliary-field_quantum_Monte_Carlo_calculations_with_multiple-projector_pseudopotentials","308026423_Combining_Internally_Contracted_States_and_Matrix_Product_States_To_Perform_Multireference_Perturbation_Theory"]}
