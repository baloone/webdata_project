Motor-driven flexible structures are multi-input multi-output systems. The design of active vibration-suppression controllers for these systems is far more challenging than for flexible structures with a fixed end, due to the effects of coupling and nonlinear vibration behavior generated in structures with poor damping. To simplify the design of the controller and achieve satisfactory vibration suppression, we treated the coupling of vibrations caused by the rotary motion of the thin flexible plate as external disturbances and system uncertainties. We employed an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control algorithm in the design of a single-input-single-output controller for the suppression of vibrations using piezoelectric sensors and actuators. We also used a repetitive control system to reduce periodic vibrations associated with the repetitive motions induced by the motor. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid intelligent control approach proposed in this study can suppress complex vibrations caused by modal excitation, coupling effects, and periodic external disturbances.","authors":["Chi-Ying Lin","Hong-Wu Jheng"],"meta":["March 2017Applied Sciences 7(3):240","DOI:10.3390/app7030240"],"references":["243782777_Zero_Phase_Error_Tracking_Algorithm_for_Digital_Control","243770195_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Discrete-Time_Repetitive_Controllers","239403353_A_Review_of_Hsub_Robust_Control_of_Piezoelectric_Smart_Structures","229058308_Multivariable_Feedback_Control_Analysis_and_Design","312900756_Analysis_and_synthesis_of_discrete-time_repetitive_controllers","270471454_Rejecting_multiple-period_disturbances_Active_vibration_control_of_a_two_degree-of-freedom_piezoelectric_flexible_structure_system","258162432_Hybrid_proportional_derivativerepetitive_control_for_active_vibration_control_of_smart_piezoelectric_structures","256800425_Vibration_suppression_control_of_smart_piezoelectric_rotating_truss_structure_by_parallel_neuro-fuzzy_control_with_genetic_algorithm_tuning","245424549_Optimum_placement_of_piezoelectric_sensoractuator_for_vibration_control_of_laminated_beams","245381452_Vibration_Suppression_Control_of_Beam-cart_System_with_Piezoelectric_Transducers_by_Decomposed_Parallel_Adaptive_Neuro-fuzzy_Control","224582154_Vibration_control_of_flexible_joint_manipulator_using_input_shaping_with_PD-type_Fuzzy_Logic_Control","224453758_Motion_control_of_a_nonlinear_pneumatic_actuating_table_by_using_self-adaptation_fuzzy_controller","223797764_A_vibration_absorber_of_smart_structures_using_adaptive_networks_in_hierarchical_fuzzy_control","223272513_Slewing_and_vibration_control_of_a_single-link_flexible_manipulator_by_positive_position_feedback_PPF","223211303_Position_control_of_a_two-link_flexible_manipulator_featuring_piezoelectric_actuators_and_sensors"]}
