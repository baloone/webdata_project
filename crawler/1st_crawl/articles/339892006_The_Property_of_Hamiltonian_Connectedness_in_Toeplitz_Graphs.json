{"id":"339892006_The_Property_of_Hamiltonian_Connectedness_in_Toeplitz_Graphs","abstract":"A spanning path in a graph G is called a Hamiltonian path. To determine which graphs possess such paths is an NP-complete problem. A graph G is called Hamiltonian-connected if any two vertices of G are connected by a Hamiltonian path. We consider here the family of Toeplitz graphs. About them, it is known only for n=3 that Tnp,q is Hamiltonian-connected, while some particular cases of Tnp,q,r for p=1 and q=2,3,4 have also been investigated regarding Hamiltonian connectedness. Here, we prove that the nonbipartite Toeplitz graph Tn1,q,r is Hamiltonian-connected for all 1","authors":["Ayesha Shabbir","Faisal Nadeem","Tudor Zamfirescu"],"meta":["March 2020Complexity 2020(2):1-6","DOI:10.1155/2020/5608720"],"references":["258149911_Hamiltonian_Connectedness_in_Directed_Toeplitz_Graphs","276175795_Hamiltonian_connectedness_of_Toeplitz_graphs","266011965_Hamilton_Connected_Graphs","265330031_Hamiltonian_Cycles_in_Directed_Toeplitz_Graphs","263413699_On_planarity_and_colorability_of_circulant_graphs","257406606_On_Planar_Toeplitz_Graphs","227780966_Connectivity_of_circulant_graphs","222472417_Efficiently_solvable_special_cases_of_bottleneck_travelling_salesman_problems","220192235_Hamiltonian_properties_of_Toeplitz_graphs","220152725_Characterizing_Bipartite_Toeplitz_Graphs"]}
