{"id":"287209315_Frame-Based_Editing_Easing_the_Transition_from_Blocks_to_Text-Based_Programming","abstract":"Block-based programming systems, such as Scratch or Alice, are the most popular environments for introducing young children to programming. However, mastery of text-based programming continues to be the educational goal for students who continue to program into their teenage years and beyond. Transitioning across the significant gap between the two editing styles presents a difficult challenge in school-level teaching of programming. We propose a new style of program manipulation to bridge the gap: frame-based editing. Frame-based editing has the resistance to errors and approachability of block-based programming while retaining the flexibility and more conventional programming semantics of text-based programming languages. In this paper, we analyse the issues involved in the transition from blocks to text and argue that they can be overcome by using frame-based editing as an intermediate step. A design and implementation of a frame-based editor is provided.","authors":["Michael KÃ¶lling","Neil Christopher Charles Brown","Amjad Altadmri"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1145/2818314.2818331","Conference: The 10th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education (WiPSCE 2015)At: London, UK","Project: Frame-Based Editing / Stride"],"references":["301429274_Programming_in_the_wild_Patterns_of_Computational_Participation_in_the_Scratch_Online_Social_Networking_Forum","286073860_Combining_Tiled_and_Textual_Views_of_Code","283765943_37_Million_Compilations_Investigating_Novice_Programming_Mistakes_in_Large-Scale_Student_Data","259581958_End-User_Experiences_of_Visual_and_Textual_Programming_Environments_for_Arduino","300918005_Scratch_A_Way_to_Logo_and_Python","283104213_Language_Migration_in_non-CS_Introductory_Programming_through_Mutual_Language_Translation_Environment","281241552_Using_Commutative_Assessments_to_Compare_Conceptual_Understanding_in_Blocks-based_and_Text-based_Programs","276555166_From_Scratch_to_Real_Programming","270394929_Empirical_Comparison_of_Visual_to_Hybrid_Formula_Manipulation_in_Educational_Programming_Languages_for_Teenagers","264543793_Restart_The_Resurgence_of_Computer_Science_in_UK_Schools"]}
