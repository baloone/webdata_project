{"id":"245424628_Final_Solution_of_Duffing_Equation_of_Mixed_Parity","abstract":"For nonlinear free vibration of laminated anisotropic plates, the restoring force function in the equation of motion is found to be a cubic polynomial, which is in the form of a Duffing type equation or a combination of quadratic and cubic terms. For nonodd restoring force function, the behavior of oscillations is different for positive and negative amplitudes. Hence, it is necessary and useful for all practical purposes to examine the uniqueness of angular frequency from the equation of motion and its energy relation, using the harmonic balance with lower order harmonics","authors":["Munmun Sarma","H.
