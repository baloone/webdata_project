{"id":"329480747_Visualizing_Multidimensional_Data_in_Treemaps_with_Adaptive_Glyphs","abstract":"Treemap is one of the most well-known and used techniques for data analysis in InfoVis. However, it still presents some challenges concerning data representation, such as small items, a large number of hierarchies limiting the visual space, few options for visual data representation (restricted to size, color, label), and others. Thus, this paper presents an InfoVis tool that allows the analysis of multidimensional data using treemaps with glyphs, once they represent more data visually combined visual variables. Besides that, considering treemap scenarios with small area items, an algorithm was developed to analyze which part of the glyph the application should draw since parts of the glyph can still provide useful information. In this way, the glyphs become adaptative to available space. The application has a multilabel decision tree technique that decides which part of the glyph should appear. Visualization specialists supplied the training data through a system that showed a diverse range of glyphs' representations. The system varied the glyph's size, the number and the value of the visible visual variables and registered the response of specialists in the training data. Finally, this paper presents images using the treemap with adaptive glyphs approach versos treemap+glyphs and showed that the adaptive approach clears information clutter when treemap items are small.","authors":["Anderson Soares","Diego Santos","Cleyton Luiz Ramos Barbosa","Aruanda Simoes Goncalves"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1109/iV.2018.00021","Conference: 2018 22nd International Conference Information Visualisation (IV)","Project: Treemaps and glyphs"],"references":["318494290_Voronoi_Treemaps","280625786_Glyph-Based_Comparative_Visualization_for_Diffusion_Tensor_Fields","268386410_The_Influence_of_Contour_on_Similarity_Perception_of_Star_Glyphs","265976458_Overlapper_movie_analyzer","261475168_Glyph_Sorting_Interactive_Visualization_for_Multi-dimensional_Data","259236634_Evaluation_of_the_Presence_of_a_Face_Search_Advantage_in_Chernoff_Faces","257666827_An_Analysis_of_Information_Visualisation","257416950_Evaluation_of_Alternative_Glyph_Designs_for_Time_Series_Data_in_a_Small_Multiple_Setting","224285723_Information_Visualization_Perception_for_Design_Second_Edition","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","41910472_Hierarchical_Aggregation_for_Information_Visualization_Overview_Techniques_and_Design_Guidelines","4888641_Comparison_of_Chernoff-type_face_and_non-graphical_methods_for_clustering_multivariate_observations","3410797_Glyphs_for_Visualizing_Uncertainty_in_Vector_Fields","303248402_A_study_on_glyph-based_visualisation_with_dense_visual_context","299544599_A_Systematic_Review_of_Experimental_Studies_on_Data_Glyphs","259237034_Visual_Search_Efficiency_for_Features_in_Chernoff_Faces","257417057_ClockMap_Enhancing_Circular_Treemaps_with_Temporal_Glyphs_for_Time-Series_Data","256623981_Comparisons_of_several_graphical_methods_for_representing_multivariate_data","254285696_Graphical_Representation_of_Multivariate_Data_by_Means_of_Asymmetrical_Faces","5878341_Visualizing_Changes_of_Hierarchical_Data_Using_Treemaps","3509204_Tree-Maps_A_Space-Filling_Approach_to_the_Visualization_of_Hierarchical_Information_Structures","2243937_Squarified_Treemaps"]}
