{"id":"311394140_Highly_cited_publications_in_World_War_II_a_bibliometric_analysis","abstract":"What are the characteristics of scientific papers published in World War II, and what papers from World War II, if any, are highly cited today? This paper reports that 3767 publications from World War II have been cited at least 100 times since 1939–1945. The data show that the publication rates of scientific papers declined during World War II only to increase rapidly after it. The USA was the most prolific source of scientific publications during the war, and Harvard University was the most dominant institute. In addition, there were five ‘Sleeping Beauties’, that is papers that were published but rarely cited during the war but came into prominence at a much later date.","authors":["Yuh-Shan Ho","James Hartley"],"meta":["December 2016Scientometrics","DOI:10.1007/s11192-016-2199-4"],"references":["220365133_Sleeping_Beauties_in_Science","313486523_Isolation_by_distance","312117565_Thermodynamics_of_high_polymer_solutions","310490689_Classic_Articles_Published_by_American_Scientists_1900-2014_A_Bibliometric_Analysis","301930151_The_colorimetric_determination_of_latic_acid_in_biological_material","288967509_Kinetics_of_Phase_Change_I_General_Theory","284976917_Thermodynamics_of_polymer_solutions","284884007_Premature_discovery_or_delayed_recognition_-_Why","284400357_Measures_of_the_Amount_of_Ecologic_Association_Between_Species","284213407_A_photometric_adaptation_of_the_Somogyi_method_to_determination_of_glucose","278165300_A_Bibliometric_Study_of_Highly_Cited_Reviews_in_the_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded_TM","257663012_The_top-cited_research_works_in_the_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded","246996156_On_a_Theory_of_the_Van_der_Waals_Adsorption_of_Gases","242591539_Individual_Comparisons_by_Ranking_Methods","239526847_Wettability_of_Porous_Surfaces","238720710_Dice_LR_Measures_of_the_Amount_of_Ecologic_Association_Between_Species_Ecology_263_297-302","234981992_Kinetics_of_phase_change","234973423_Statistical_Mechanics_of_Cross-Linked_Polymer_Networks_II_Swelling","234880240_Kinetics_of_phase_change_Part_III_Granulation_phase_change_and_microstructure","234859555_Dispersion_and_Absorption_in_Dielectrics_I_Alternating_Current_Characteristics","232314053_A_New_Coupling_Component_for_Sulfanilamide_Determination","232170275_Determination_of_Total_Organic_and_Available_Forms_of_Phosphorus_in_Soils","231516882_On_A_Theory_of_The_Vander_Waals_Adsorption_of_Gases","231222434_Non-Parametric_Test_Against_Trend","230718261_The_Scherrer_Formula_for_X-Ray_Particle_Size_Determination","228678320_Comparison_of_universities'_scientific_performance_using_bibliometric_indicators","228077288_The_Electrical_Resistivity_Log_as_an_Aid_in_Determining_Some_Reservoir_Characteristics","225048285_The_most_frequently_cited_adsorption_research_articles_in_the_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded","224558403_General_Theory_of_Three-Dimensional_Consolidation","222307937_Brownian_Motion_In_A_Field_Of_Force_And_The_Diffusion_Model_Of_Chemical_Reactions","220364717_High-impact_papers_presented_in_the_subject_category_of_water_resources_in_the_Essential_Science_Indicators_database_of_the_Institute_for_Scientific_Information","220040705_A_Theory_of_Human_Motivation","200105062_Crystal_Statistics_I_A_Two-Dimensional_Model_with_an_Order-Disorder_Transition","47510156_Japanese_Lung_Cancer_Research_Trends_and_Performance_in_Science_Citation_Index","23248112_Citation_indexing_and_highly_cited_articles_in_the_Australian_Veterinary_Journal","7201615_On_the_Stability_of_the_Linear_Functional_Equation","7190796_The_Compressability_of_Media_Under_Extreme_Pressure"]}
