{"id":"312153320_Mixing_beliefs_among_interacting_agents","abstract":"We present a model of opinion dynamics in which agents adjust continuous opinions as a result of random binary encounters whenever their difference in opinion is below a given threshold. High thresholds yield convergence of opinions towards an average opinion, whereas low thresholds result in several opinion clusters: members of the ame cluster share the same opinion but are no longer influenced by members of other clusters.","authors":["Guillaume Deffuant","D.
