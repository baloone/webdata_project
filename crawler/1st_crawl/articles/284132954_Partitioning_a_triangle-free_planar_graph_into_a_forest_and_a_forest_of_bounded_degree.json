{"id":"284132954_Partitioning_a_triangle-free_planar_graph_into_a_forest_and_a_forest_of_bounded_degree","abstract":"An $({\\cal F},{\\cal F}_d)$-partition of a graph is a vertex-partition into\ntwo sets $F$ and $F_d$ such that the graph induced by $F$ is a forest and the\none induced by $F_d$ is a forest with maximum degree at most $d$. We prove that\nevery triangle-free planar graph admits an $({\\cal F},{\\cal F}_5)$-partition.\nMoreover we show that if for some integer $d$ there exists a triangle-free\nplanar graph that does not admit an $({\\cal F},{\\cal F}_d)$-partition, then it\nis an NP-complete problem to decide whether a triangle-free planar graph admits\nsuch a partition.","authors":["Franois Dross","Mickael Montassier","Alexandre Pinlou"],"meta":["November 2015Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics 49:269-275","DOI:10.1016/j.endm.2015.06.037"],"references":["265355357_On_the_partition_of_a_planar_graph_of_girth_5_into_an_empty_and_an_acyclic_subgraph","285344777_Decomposing_planar_graphs_of_girth_5_into_an_edgeless_and_acyclic_subgraphs","284301121_Proof_of_Grunbaum's_conjecture_on_acyclic_5-colorability_of_plane_graphs","281910763_Near-colorings_Non-colorable_graphs_and_NP-completeness","248859292_Every_planar_map_is_4_-_colorable_-_2_Reducibility","248838938_Every_planar_map_is_4_-_colorable_-_1_Discharging","246115566_Every_Planar_Map_is_Four_Colorable","237012800_Near-Colorings_Non-Colorable_Graphs_and_NP-Completeness","229598798_On_the_linear_vertex-arboricity_of_a_planar_graph","223143931_On_the_vertex-arboricity_of_planar_graphs","222294865_Decomposing_a_Planar_Graph_into_Degenerate_Graphs","220223971_Planar_Graph_Coloring_Avoiding_Monochromatic_Subgraphs_Trees_and_Paths_Make_It_Difficult","220078856_Decomposing_a_Planar_Graph_into_an_Independent_Set_and_a_3-Degenerate_Graph","31192018_The_Point-Arboricity_of_Planar_Graphs"]}
