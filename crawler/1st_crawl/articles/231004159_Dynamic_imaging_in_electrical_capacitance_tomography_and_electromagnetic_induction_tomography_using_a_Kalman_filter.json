{"id":"231004159_Dynamic_imaging_in_electrical_capacitance_tomography_and_electromagnetic_induction_tomography_using_a_Kalman_filter","abstract":"Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and electromagnetic induction tomography (EMT) attempt to visualize the distributions of materials with different permittivity and conductivity/permeability, aiming to reveal electrical and magnetic characteristics of an object, by measuring electrical capacitance and electromagnetic inductance on the periphery of the object. In ECT, capacitances of pairs of electrodes placed around the periphery are measured and in EMT, mutual induction of pairs of coils is measured. In this paper, a dynamic imaging technique is developed for ECT and EMT with a linearized Kalman filter to improve the temporal resolution of images. The inverse problem is treated as a state estimate. A Kalman estimator is used to obtain the material distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the dynamic imaging technique can improve the spatio-temporal resolution of both ECT and EMT.","authors":["Manuchehr Soleimani","Marko Vauhkonen","Wuqiang Yang","A.J.
