{"id":"220223818_On_Coloring_Unit_Disk_Graphs","abstract":". In this paper the coloring problem for unit disk (UD) graphs is considered. UD graphs are the intersection graphs of equal-sized\ndisks in the plane. Colorings of UD graphs arise in the study of channel assignment problems in broadcast networks. Improving\non a result of Clark et al. [2] it is shown that the coloring problem for UD graphs remains NP-complete for any fixed number of colors k≥ 3 . Furthermore, a new 3-approximation algorithm for the problem is presented which is based on network flow and matching techniques.","authors":["Albert Gräf","M.
