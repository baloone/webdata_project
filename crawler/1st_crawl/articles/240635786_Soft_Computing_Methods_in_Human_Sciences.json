{"id":"240635786_Soft_Computing_Methods_in_Human_Sciences","abstract":"We have considered SC applications in the human sciences. We have stated that two principal methodological traditions prevail in these sciences, namely quantitative and qualitative approaches. The former mainly apply bivalent logic and precise numerical data and methods in a computer environment, whereas the latter usually operate with multi-valent logic and imprecise non-numerical data, which are examined manually, using only a researcherâ€™s reasonings and interpretations. To date, no large-scale interaction has taken place between these traditions.","authors":["Vesa A.
