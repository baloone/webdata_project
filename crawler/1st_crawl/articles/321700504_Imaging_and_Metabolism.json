{"id":"321700504_Imaging_and_Metabolism","abstract":"This book presents advanced molecular imaging techniques used to assess metabolic function. Covering state-of-the art modalities, it discusses the evaluation of a wide range of diseases that have a metabolic component, including cancer, inflammatory conditions, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disorders. Imaging provides a quantitative perspective to the assessment of metabolic function and complements genetic analysis of disorders related to disrupted metabolism. Organized into four parts, the book highlights basic principles in molecular imaging techniques; metabolic imaging approaches, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and hybrid modalities; metabolic diseases; and future perspectives. Featuring contributions from leading authorities in radiology, oncology, cardiology, and neurology, Imaging and Metabolism is a pioneering exploration of the role of imaging modalities in assessing the physiological status of abnormal cells and diagnosing disease.
