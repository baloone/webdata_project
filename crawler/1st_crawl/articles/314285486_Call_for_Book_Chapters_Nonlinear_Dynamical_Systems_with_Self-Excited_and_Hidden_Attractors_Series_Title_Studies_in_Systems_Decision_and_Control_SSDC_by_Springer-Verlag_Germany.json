Previous research has established that a self-excited attractor has a basin of attraction which is excited from unstable equilibrium point. As a result, classical nonlinear systems such as Lorenz's system, Rössler's system, Chen's system, Lü's system, or Sprott's system are considered as systems with self-excited attractors. Several attempts have been made to study systems with self-excited attractors, which appear in various fields from computer sciences, physics, communications, biology, mechanics, chemistry, to economics and finance. However, there are still different questions which invite more investigation in such systems with self-excited attractors.","authors":["Viet-Thanh Pham","Sundarapandian Vaidyanathan","Christos Volos","Tomasz Kapitaniak"],"meta":["December 2017","Project: Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Self-Excited and Hidden Attractors"],"references":[]}
