{"id":"331090443_Starlike_Functions_Related_to_the_Bell_Numbers","abstract":"The present paper aims to establish the first order differential subordination relations between functions with a positive real part and starlike functions related to the Bell numbers. In addition, several sharp radii estimates for functions in the class of starlike functions associated with the Bell numbers are determined.","authors":["Nak Eun Cho","Sushil Kumar","Virendra Kumar","V.
