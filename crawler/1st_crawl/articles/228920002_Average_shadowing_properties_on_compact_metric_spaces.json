{"id":"228920002_Average_shadowing_properties_on_compact_metric_spaces","abstract":"We prove that if a continuous surjective map f on a compact metric space X has the average shadowing property, then every point x is chain recurrent. We also show that if a homeomorphism f has more than two fixed points on S 1 , then f does not satisfy the average shadowing property. Moreover, we construct a homeomorphism on a circle which satisfies the shadowing property but not the average shadowing property. This shows that the converse of the theorem 1.1 of Y. Zhang [Acta Sci. Nat. Univ. Pekin. 37, No. 5, 648â€“651 (2001; Zbl 1022.37017)] is not true.","authors":["Jong-Jin Park","Yong Zhang"],"meta":["April 2006Communications of the Korean Mathematical Society 21(2):355-361","DOI:10.4134/CKMS.2006.21.2.355"],"references":["38371609_Diffeomorphisms_with_the_Average-Shadowing_Property_on_Two-Dimensional_Closed_Manifolds","267144134_On_the_average-shadowing_property","265957388_Pseudo-orbit_tracing_property_and_limit_shadowing_property_on_a_circle","253822655_Small_perturbations_of_chaotic_dynamical_systems","231873998_Metric_properties_of_e-trajectories_of_dynamical_systems_with_stochastic_behaviour","44725193_Equilibrium_States_and_the_Ergodic_Theory_of_Anosov_Diffeomorphism"]}
