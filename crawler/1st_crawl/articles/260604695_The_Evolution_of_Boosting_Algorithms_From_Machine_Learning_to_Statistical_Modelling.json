{"id":"260604695_The_Evolution_of_Boosting_Algorithms_From_Machine_Learning_to_Statistical_Modelling","abstract":"The concept of boosting emerged from the field of machine learning. The basic\nidea is to boost the accuracy of a weak classifying tool by combining various\ninstances into a more accurate prediction. This general concept was later\nadapted to the field of statistical modelling. This review article attempts to\nhighlight this evolution of boosting algorithms from machine learning to\nstatistical modelling. We describe the AdaBoost algorithm for classification as\nwell as the two most prominent statistical boosting approaches, gradient\nboosting and likelihood-based boosting. Although both appraoches are typically\ntreated separately in the literature, they share the same methodological roots\nand follow the same fundamental concepts. Compared to the initial machine\nlearning algorithms, which must be seen as black-box prediction schemes,\nstatistical boosting result in statistical models which offer a\nstraight-forward interpretation. We highlight the methodological background and\npresent the most common software implementations.","authors":["Andreas Mayr","Harald Binder","Olaf Gefeller","Matthias Schmid"],"meta":["March 2014Methods of Information in Medicine 53(5)","DOI:10.3414/ME13-01-0122","SourcearXiv"],"references":["290824736_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Voting_Classification_Algorithms_Bagging_Boosting_and_Variants","329476733_Regression_Prediction_and_Shrinkage","318393770_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","313552808_An_introduction_to_boosting_and_leveraging","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","298820753_Response_to_Mease_and_Wyner_evidence_contrary_to_the_statistical_view_of_boosting_JMLR_9131-156_2008","288906520_Random_forests","280687718_Greedy_Function_Approximation_A_Gradient_Boosting_Machine","278621821_Probability_estimation_with_machine_learning_methods_for_dichotomous_and_multi-category_outcome_Theory","275340906_Random_Forests","272832134_The_Strength_of_Weak_Learnability","270761631_Generalized_Aditive_Models","265500895_Statistical_Learning_for_Biomedical_Data","265444019_Arcing_classifiers_With_discussion","260869827_Boosting_Foundations_and_Algorithms"]}
