These techniques can be used to minimize objective functions written as the sum of a set of unary and pairwise terms, provided that the objective function is submodular. This can be interpreted as minimizing the \\(l_1\\)-norm of the vector containing all pairwise and unary terms. By raising each term to a power p, the same technique can also be used to minimize the \\(l_p\\)-norm of the vector. Unfortunately, the submodularity of an \\(l_1\\)-norm objective function does not guarantee the submodularity of the corresponding \\(l_p\\)-norm objective function. The contribution of this paper is to provide useful conditions under which an \\(l_p\\)-norm objective function is submodular for all \\(p\\ge 1\\), thereby identifying a large class of \\(l_p\\)-norm objective functions that can be minimized via minimal graph cuts.","authors":["Filip Malmberg","Robin Strand"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-05288-1_9","In book: Combinatorial Image Analysis (pp.112-117)"],"references":["244898935_Graph_Cuts_and_Efficient_ND_Image_Segmentation","224196187_Power_Watershed_A_Unifying_Graph-Based_Optimization_Framework","220146011_Links_Between_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_Optimum-Path_Forest_and_Minimum_Cut_in_Graph","6336345_Minimizing_Nonsubmodular_Functions_with_Graph_Cuts-A_Review","286245681_Strict_Minimizers_For_Geometric_Optimization","222527996_Some_links_between_extremum_spanning_forests_watersheds_and_min-cuts","8337762_What_Energy_Functions_Can_Be_Minimized_via_Graph_Cuts","3193315_Fast_approximate_energy_minimization_via_graph_cuts_IEEE_PAMI_2311_1222-1239"]}
