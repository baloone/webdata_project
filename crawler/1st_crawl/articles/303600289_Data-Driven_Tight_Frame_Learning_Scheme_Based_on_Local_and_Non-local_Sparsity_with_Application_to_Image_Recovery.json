{"id":"303600289_Data-Driven_Tight_Frame_Learning_Scheme_Based_on_Local_and_Non-local_Sparsity_with_Application_to_Image_Recovery","abstract":"Sparse representation has shown to be a successful technique in the fields of image restoration and other image processing tasks over the past few years. The key of the approach with application to image recovery is how to sparsely represent the true-image data, which seriously affects its recovery quality. One such representative method is the widely used wavelet tight frame. However, the filters of the classical wavelet frame are fixed and unchanged for different input images. To overcome the limitation, a data-driven tight frame was proposed to learn a good sparse representation from the image itself very recently. However, the filters of the tight frame are only learned from the selected local image patches, and it doesnâ€™t utilize the non-local similarity of image patches. In this paper, we further propose a 3D data-driven tight frame learning scheme which considers both the local and non-local sparse representation of image patches, and establish a variational model for image recovery based on the new sparse representation method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the recently proposed state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Dai-Qiang Chen"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Scientific Computing 69(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-016-0205-x"],"references":["313578840_Learning_multiscale_sparse_representations_for_image_and_video_restoration","313419383_Sparsity-based_image_denoising_via_dictionary_learning_and_structural_clustering","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","286784019_Ill-posed_problems","277436956_A_New_TV-Stokes_Model_with_Augmented_Lagrangian_Method_for_Image_Denoising_and_Deconvolution","274387962_Wavelet_Frame_Based_Image_Restoration_via_Combined_Sparsity_and_Nonlocal_Prior_of_Coefficients","272194619_Image_denoising_based_on_improved_data-driven_sparse_representation","271630624_Data-Driven_Multi-scale_Non-local_Wavelet_Frame_Construction_and_Image_Recovery","260624869_Hessian_Schatten-Norm_Regularization_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","259142309_Data-driven_tight_frame_construction_and_image_denoising","256476120_MRA-Based_Wavelet_Frames_and_Applications","239442023_Bandelet_Image_Approximation_and_Compression","247131283_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","236205983_Image_Processing_Using_Smooth_Ordering_of_its_Patches","232225859_Nonlocal_Image_Restoration_With_Bilateral_Variance_Estimation_A_Low-Rank_Approach"]}
