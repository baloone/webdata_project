{"id":"268634817_An_Introduction_to_the_Navier-Stokes_Initial-Boundary_Value_Problem","abstract":"The equations of motion of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid — usually called Navier-Stokes equations — have been written almost one hundred eighty years ago. In fact, they were proposed in 1822 by the French engineer C.M.L.H. Navier upon the basis of a suitable molecular model. It is interesting to observe, however, that the law of interaction between the molecules postulated by Navier were shortly recognized to be totally inconsistent from the physical point of view for several materials and, in particular, for liquids. It was only more than twenty years later that the same equations were rederived by the twenty-six year old G. H. Stokes 1845 in a quite general way, by means of the theory of continua.","authors":["Giovanni P.
