{"id":"311957085_Exposure_diversity_as_a_design_principle_for_recommender_systems","abstract":"Personalized recommendations in search engines, social media and also in more traditional media increasingly raise concerns over potentially negative consequences for diversity and the quality of public discourse. The algorithmic filtering and adaption of online content to personal preferences and interests is often associated with a decrease in the diversity of information to which users are exposed. Notwithstanding the question of whether these claims are correct or not, this article discusses whether and how recommendations can also be designed to stimulate more diverse exposure to information and to break potential ‘filter bubbles’ rather than create them. Combining insights from democratic theory, computer science and law, the article makes suggestions for design principles and explores the potential and possible limits of ‘diversity sensitive design’.","authors":["Natali Helberger","Kari Karppinen","Lucia D'Acunto"],"meta":["December 2016Information Communication and Society 21(2):1-17","DOI:10.1080/1369118X.2016.1271900","Project: Personalised Communication"],"references":["318265499_Blockbusters_and_Wallflowers_Speeding_up_Diverse_and_Accurate_Recommendations_with_Random_Walks","301684411_Rethinking_Media_Pluralism","344486387_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Autonomy","311450892_Nudge_and_the_Manipulation_of_Choice","305553863_Inclusion_and_Democracy","301432309_Letting_Users_Choose_Recommender_Algorithms","297736928_The_algorithmic_imaginary_exploring_the_ordinary_affects_of_Facebook_algorithms","289593485_Merely_Facilitating_or_Actively_Stimulating_Diverse_Media_Choices_Public_Service_Media_at_the_Crossroad","289179740_Agonistic_democracy","289002598_Rethinking_media_pluralism"]}
