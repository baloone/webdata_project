{"id":"222523851_Detect_overlapping_and_hierarchical_community_structure_in_networks","abstract":"Clustering and community structure is crucial for many network systems and the related dynamic processes. It has been shown that communities are usually overlapping and hierarchical. However, previous methods investigate these two properties of community structure separately. This paper proposes an algorithm (EAGLE) to detect both the overlapping and hierarchical properties of complex community structure together. This algorithm deals with the set of maximal cliques and adopts an agglomerative framework. The quality function of modularity is extended to evaluate the goodness of a cover. The examples of application to real world networks give excellent results.","authors":["Huawei Shen","Xueqi Cheng","Kai Cai","Mao-Bin Hu"],"meta":["April 2009Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 388(8):1706-1712","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2008.12.021","SourcearXiv"],"references":["227058041_2007_Resolution_limit_in_complex_network_community_detection_with_Potts_model_approach_Eur","11185441_Mongru_DA_Oltvai_ZN_Barabasi_AL_Hierarchical_organisation_of_modularity_in_metabolic_networks","7797121_Uncovering_the_overlapping_community_structure_of_complex_networks_in_nature_and_society","7567871_Community_Detection_in_Complex_Networks_Using_Extremal_Optimization","6609402_Resolution_limit_in_community_detection","5248536_Defining_and_identifying_communities_in_networks","2955610_Self-Organization_and_Identification_of_Web_Communities","1910341_Detecting_the_overlapping_and_hierarchical_community_structure_in_complex_networks","1906468_Extending_the_definition_of_modularity_to_directed_graphs_with_overlapping_communities","1880802_Comparing_community_structure_identification","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","296934181_Extracting_the_hierarchical_organization_of_complex_systems_vol_104_pg_15224_2007","288913482_Community_Structure_Identification","285874604_Functional_Cartography_of_Complex_Metabolic_Networks","283738615_Resolution_limit_in_community_detection","254790420_Finding_cliques_in_a_undirected_graph","253253918_Detecting_Community_Structure_in_Networks","244419758_Barabasi_AL_Hierarchical_organization_of_modularity_in_metabolic_networks","232771086_Uncovering_the_overlapping_community_structure_of_complex_networks_in_nature_and_society","222411422_The_Structure_and_Function_of_Complex_Networks","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks","220766254_Extracting_Communities_from_Complex_Networks_by_the_k-Dense_Method","220423131_Finding_All_Cliques_of_an_Undirected_Graph","220240993_Extracting_Communities_from_Complex_Networks_by_the","220153100_Post-Processing_Hierarchical_Community_Structures_Quality_Improvements_and_Multi-scale_View","37811236_Exploring_Complex_Networks","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks","12075011_Strogatz_SH_Exploring_Complex_Networks_Nature_410_268","11313118_Girvan_M_Newman_M_E_J_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA_99_7821-7826","8463952_Fast_algorithm_for_detecting_community_structure_in_networks_Phys_Rev_E_Stat_Nonlin_Soft_Matter_Phys_696_Pt_2_066133","8036129_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","8004992_Nunes_Amaral_Functional_cartography_of_complex_metabolic_networks","7659762_Finding_and_Evaluating_Community_Structure_in_Networks","6768757_Finding_Community_Structure_in_Networks_Using_the_Eigenvectors_of_Matrices","5960738_Extracting_the_hierarchical_organization_of_complex_systems","2605577_Newman_MEJ_The_structure_and_function_of_complex_networks_SIAM_Rev_45_167-256","1827666_Statistical_Mechanics_Of_Complex_Networks"]}
