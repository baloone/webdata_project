{"id":"332773245_Exact_String_Matching_Algorithms_Survey_Issues_and_Future_Research_Directions","abstract":"String matching has been an extensively studied research domain in the past two decades due to its various applications in the fields of text, image, signal, and speech processing. As a result, choosing an appropriate string matching algorithm for current applications and addressing challenges is difficult. Understanding different string matching approaches(such as exact string matching, approximate string matching algorithms), integrating several algorithms, and modifying algorithms to address related issues are also difficult. This article presents a survey on single-pattern exact string matching algorithms.The main purpose of this survey is to propose new classification, identify new directions and highlight the possible challenges, current trends, and future works in the area of string matching algorithms with a core focus on exact string matching algorithms.","authors":["Saqib Iqbal Hakak","Amirrudin Kamsin","Shivakumara Palaiahnakote","Gulshan Amin Gilkar"],"meta":["April 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914071"],"references":["328961712_An_Efficient_Text_Representation_for_Searching_and_Retrieving_Classical_Diacritical_Arabic_Text","326816513_INFLUENCED_FACTORS_ON_COMPUTATION_AMONG_QUICK_SEARCH_TWO-WAY_AND_KARP-RABIN_ALGORITHMS","326641763_A_new_split_based_searching_for_exact_pattern_matching_for_natural_texts","325888183_Residual-based_approach_for_authenticating_pattern_of_multi-style_diacritical_Arabic_texts","321712748_Efficient_Wu-Manber_Pattern_Matching_Hardware_for_Intrusion_and_Malware_Detection","318855608_Efficient_Online_Timed_Pattern_Matching_by_Automata-Based_Skipping","326692391_Partition-based_pattern_matching_approach_for_efficient_retrieval_of_Arabic_text","323672254_Efficient_String_Matching_FPGA_for_speed_up_Network_Intrusion_Detection","320094723_Memory-Based_Architecture_for_Multicharacter_Aho-Corasick_String_Matching","319266927_Approaches_for_preserving_content_integrity_of_sensitive_online_Arabic_content_A_survey_and_research_challenges"]}
