{"id":"258083531_An_Epistemic_Approach_to_Compositional_Reasoning_about_Anonymity_and_Privacy","abstract":"In this paper, we present an epistemic logic approach to the compositionality\nof several privacy-related informationhiding/ disclosure properties. The\nproperties considered here are anonymity, privacy, onymity, and identity. Our\ninitial observation reveals that anonymity and privacy are not necessarily\nsequentially compositional; this means that even though a system comprising\nseveral sequential phases satisfies a certain unlinkability property in each\nphase, the entire system does not always enjoy a desired unlinkability\nproperty. We show that the compositionality can be guaranteed provided that the\nphases of the system satisfy what we call the independence assumptions. More\nspecifically, we develop a series of theoretical case studies of what\nassumptions are sufficient to guarantee the sequential compositionality of\nvarious degrees of anonymity, privacy, onymity, and/or identity properties.\nSimilar results for parallel composition are also discussed.","authors":["Yasuyuki Tsukada","Hideki Sakurada","Ken Mano","Yoshifumi Manabe"],"meta":["October 2016Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence 78(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10472-016-9516-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262215768_Automatic_verification_of_epistemic_specifications_under_convergent_equational_theories","257013917_Reasoning_about_minimal_anonymity_in_security_protocols","253954817_On_the_Limits_of_Provable_Anonymity","304585092_Anonymity_and_information_hiding_in_multiagent_systems","289689049_Anonymity_privacy_onymity_and_identityA_modal_logic_approach","284332229_k-Anonymity_A_Model_for_Protecting_Privacy","266621660_A_new_method_of_formalizing_anonymity_based_on_protocol_composition_logic","263621619_k-ANONYMITY_A_MODEL_FOR_PROTECTING_PRIVACY","261450485_An_Epistemic_Approach_to_Coercion-Resistance_for_Electronic_Voting_Protocols","260635010_Anonymous_connections_and_onion_routing"]}
