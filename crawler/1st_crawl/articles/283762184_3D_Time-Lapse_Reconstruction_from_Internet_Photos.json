{"id":"283762184_3D_Time-Lapse_Reconstruction_from_Internet_Photos","abstract":"Given an Internet photo collection of a landmark, we compute a 3D time-lapse\nvideo sequence where a virtual camera moves continuously in time and space.\nWhile previous work assumed a static camera, the addition of camera motion\nduring the time-lapse creates a very compelling impression of parallax.\nAchieving this goal, however, requires addressing multiple technical\nchallenges, including solving for time-varying depth maps, regularizing 3D\npoint color profiles over time, and reconstructing high quality, hole-free\nimages at every frame from the projected profiles. Our results show\nphotorealistic time-lapses of skylines and natural scenes over many years, with\ndramatic parallax effects.","authors":["Ricardo Martin Brualla","David Gallup","Steven M.
