{"id":"334093714_A_Trust_Based_Mechanism_to_Combat_Blackhole_Attack_in_RPL_Protocol","abstract":"This article deals with a prime security attack -blackhole attack in Internet of Things networks that uses the RPL in the network layer for routing of data packets. Latest studies indicate that the security has not been given a bigger priority among manufacturers thereby providing a window of opportunity for attacks to creep into a network. A trust-based mechanism is built over the RPL protocol specifically tackle the blackhole attacks. The Cooja simulator based on Contiki OS was used for experimental analysis and the proposed scheme yields better security when the participating nodes were exposed to the blackhole attack.","authors":["Bhalaji Natarajan","K.
