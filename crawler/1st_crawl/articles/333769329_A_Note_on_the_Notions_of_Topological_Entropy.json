{"id":"333769329_A_Note_on_the_Notions_of_Topological_Entropy","abstract":"Topological entropy is used to determine the complexity of a dynamical system. This paper aims to serve as a stepping stone for the study of topological entropy. We review the notions of topological entropy, give an overview on the relation between the notions and fundamental properties of topological entropy. Besides, we cover the topological entropy of the induced hyperspaces and its connection with the original systems. We also provide a summary on the latest research topic related with topological entropy.","authors":["Koon Sang Wong","Zabidin Salleh"],"meta":["November 2018Earthline Journal of Mathematical Sciences","DOI:10.34198/ejms.1119.0116"],"references":["328071890_Induced_hyperspace_dynamical_systems_of_symbolic_dynamical_systems","283351277_Continuum-wise_expansiveness_and_specification_for_set-valued_functions_and_topological_entropy","321354567_Topological_entropy_of_a_graph_map","321338293_Topologies_on_spaces_of_subsets","319449400_On_Topological_Entropy_of_Zadeh's_Extension_Defined_on_Piecewise_Convex_Fuzzy_Sets","303493814_Topological_entropy_bounds_measure-theoretic_entropy","303351902_The_product_theorem_for_topological_entropy","290889923_Hyperspaces_of_sets","288039475_On_fuzzy_entropy_and_topological_entropy_of_fuzzy_extensions_of_dynamical_systems","285240764_On_the_concept_of_entropy_of_dynamical_system"]}
