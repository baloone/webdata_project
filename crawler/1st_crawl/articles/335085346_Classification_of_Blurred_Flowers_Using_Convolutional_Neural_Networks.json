{"id":"335085346_Classification_of_Blurred_Flowers_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"In recent years, flower image processing has been improved dramatically with the help of deep learning, notably convolutional neural network related algorithms. With the advent of smart devices, it becomes much easier to take photos of wild flowers for non-professional people. However, this raises new challenges in flower image processing due to blur effect. In this paper, we present a two-step automatic classification method based on a convolutional neural network for wild flowers. We first preprocess flower images by classifying them as either blurred or clear images. Then we extract features of clear images using the convolutional neural network and classify them accordingly with these features. Results show that we can improve the classification rate by 33.78%, reaching an accuracy of 90.20%.","authors":["Chao Chen","Qi Yan","Meng Li","Jijun Tong"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3342999.3343006","Conference: the 2019 3rd International Conference"],"references":["315697147_Selective_Convolutional_Descriptor_Aggregation_for_Fine-Grained_Image_Retrieval","311991204_On_the_Exploration_of_Convolutional_Fusion_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","311090518_Towards_Reversal-Invariant_Image_Representation","310471782_On_the_Exploration_of_Convolutional_Fusion_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","261100864_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_An_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition","226635066_Modulating_Shape_Features_by_Color_Attention_for_Object_Recognition","330245877_Convolution_Neural_Network_based_Transfer_Learning_for_Classification_of_Flowers","329132763_Cascade-Forward_Neural_Network_in_Identification_of_Plant_Species_of_Desert_Based_on_Wild_Flowers","324478963_Flower_Classification_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","318574943_Inception-v3_for_flower_classification","317330237_LG-CNN_From_Local_Parts_to_Global_Discrimination_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition","313411538_Hierarchical_Deep_Semantic_Representation_for_Visual_Categorization","312562134_Flower_classification_via_convolutional_neural_network","312114792_Collaborative_representation_based_fine-grained_species_recognition","309513864_Two-level_hierarchical_feature_learning_for_image_classification","308868551_Fine-grained_visual_categorization_via_multi-stage_metric_learning","300483341_Image_Classification_and_Retrieval_are_ONE","300408371_Task-Driven_Feature_Pooling_for_Image_Classification","282196540_Fusing_well-crafted_feature_descriptors_for_efficient_fine-grained_classification","264499164_Sparse_Representation_Based_Fisher_Discrimination_Dictionary_Learning_for_Image_Classification","221551861_Automated_Flower_Classification_over_a_Large_Number_of_Classes","220664230_An_interactive_flower_image_recognition_system","4246325_A_Visual_Vocabulary_for_Flower_Classification","4090440_Evaluation_of_Model-Based_Interactive_Flower_Recognition"]}
