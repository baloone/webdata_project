{"id":"320464881_Specialising_Word_Vectors_for_Lexical_Entailment","abstract":"We present LEAR (Lexical Entailment Attract-Repel), a novel post-processing method that transforms any input word vector space to emphasise the asymmetric relation of lexical entailment (LE), also known as the is-a or hyponymy-hypernymy relation. By injecting external linguistic constraints (e.g., WordNet links) into the initial vector space, the LE specialisation procedure brings true hyponymy-hypernymy pairs closer together in the transformed Euclidean space. The proposed asymmetric distance measure adjusts the norms of word vectors to reflect the actual WordNet-style hierarchy of concepts. Simultaneously, a joint objective enforces semantic similarity using the symmetric cosine distance, yielding a vector space specialised for both lexical relations at once. LEAR specialisation achieves state-of-the-art performance in the tasks of hypernymy directionality, hypernymy detection and graded lexical entailment, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model.","authors":["Ivan Vulić","Nikola Mrkšić"],"meta":["October 2017"],"references":["322590649_Dual_Tensor_Model_for_Detecting_Asymmetric_Lexico-Semantic_Relations","318670971_Hierarchical_Embeddings_for_Hypernymy_Detection_and_Directionality","322588033_Cross-Lingual_Induction_and_Transfer_of_Verb_Classes_Based_on_Word_Vector_Space_Specialisation","319770369_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","319770245_Order-Embeddings_of_Images_and_Language","318740822_Neural_Belief_Tracker_Data-Driven_Dialogue_State_Tracking","318740615_Hypernyms_under_Siege_Linguistically-motivated_Artillery_for_Hypernymy_Detection","318739373_Morph-fitting_Fine-Tuning_Word_Vector_Spaces_with_Simple_Language-Specific_Rules","317300281_Semantic_Specialisation_of_Distributional_Word_Vector_Spaces_using_Monolingual_and_Cross-Lingual_Constraints","312250886_SimVerb-3500_A_Large-Scale_Evaluation_Set_of_Verb_Similarity"]}
