{"id":"303691107_The_Next_Whisky_Bar","abstract":"We determine the complexity of an optimization problem related to information theory. Taking a conjunctive propositional formula over some finite set of Boolean relations as input, we seek a satisfying assignment of the formula having minimal Hamming distance to a given assignment that is not required to be a model (NearestSolution, NSol). We obtain a complete classification with respect to the relations admitted in the formula. For two classes of constraint languages we present polynomial time algorithms; otherwise, we prove hardness or completeness concerning the classes APX, poly-APX, NPO, or equivalence to well-known hard optimization problems.","authors":["Mike Behrisch","Miki Hermann","Stefan Mengel","Gernot Salzer"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-34171-2_4","Conference: International Computer Science Symposium in Russia"],"references":["237654012_Playing_with_Boolean_Blocks_Part_II_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems1","226568752_Tight_bounds_and_2-approximation_algorithms_for_integer_programs_with_two_variables_per_inequality","308942443_As_Close_as_It_Gets","300217992_Give_Me_Another_One","273001922_Theory_of_linear_and_integer_programming","268614150_Complexity_Classifications_of_Boolean_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","266515478_Complexity_and_approximation_Combinatorial_optimization_problems_and_their_approximability_properties_Incl_1_CD-ROM","257650319_Complexity_and_Approximation","228057867_Theory_of_Linear_and_Integer_Programming","222813521_Bases_for_Boolean_co-clones"]}
