{"id":"322347821_On_the_total_variation_distance_between_the_binomial_random_graph_and_the_random_intersection_graph","abstract":"When each vertex is assigned a set, the intersection graph generated by the sets is the graph in which two distinct vertices are joined by an edge if and only if their assigned sets have a nonempty intersection. An interval graph is an intersection graph generated by intervals in the real line. A chordal graph can be considered as an intersection graph generated by subtrees of a tree. In 1999, Karoński, Scheinerman, and Singer-Cohen introduced a random intersection graph by taking randomly assigned sets. The random intersection graph G(n,m;p) has n vertices and sets assigned to the vertices are chosen to be i.i.d. random subsets of a fixed set M of size m where each element of M belongs to each random subset with probability p, independently of all other elements in M. In 2000, Fill, Scheinerman, and Singer-Cohen showed that the total variation distance between the random graph G(n,m;p) and the Erdös-Rényi graph G(n,p̂) tends to 0 for any 0≤p=p(n)≤1 if m=nα, α>6, where p̂ is chosen so that the expected numbers of edges in the two graphs are the same. In this paper, it is proved that the total variation distance still tends to 0 for any 0≤p=p(n)≤1 whenever m≫n4.","authors":["Jeong Han Kim","Sang June Lee","Joohan Na"],"meta":["January 2018Random Structures and Algorithms 52(16)","DOI:10.1002/rsa.20750"],"references":["258228868_Degree_and_clustering_coefficient_in_sparse_random_intersection_graphs","230899395_Assortativity_and_clustering_of_sparse_random_intersection_graphs","227176347_Degree_distribution_of_a_typical_vertex_in_a_general_random_intersection_graph","224703391_Sensor_Networks_that_Are_Provably_Resilient","305979081_Some_applications_of_the_Stein-Chen_method_for_proving_Poisson_convergence","305973233_Epidemics_on_Random_Graphs_with_Tunable_Clustering","288245735_Sur_Deux_Proprietes_des_Classes_d'Ensembles","283549068_Recent_Progress_in_Complex_Network_Analysis_Models_of_Random_Intersection_Graphs","283549066_Recent_Progress_in_Complex_Network_Analysis_Properties_of_Random_Intersection_Graphs","279422310_Two_Models_of_Random_Intersection_Graphs_for_Classification","267672007_Some_Applications_of_the_Stein-Chen_Method_for_Proving_Poisson_Convergence","265461870_The_Representation_of_a_Graph_by_Set_Intersections","262202764_A_Guided_Tour_in_Random_Intersection_Graphs","259371300_On_Random_Intersection_Graphs_The_Subgraph_Problem","243787289_Lectures_on_the_Coupling_Method","243768419_Topics_in_Intersection_Graph_Theory","235410209_Random_Graphs_for_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition","230267705_Some_applications_of_graph_theory_and_related_nonmetric_techniques_to_problems_of_approximate_seriation_The_case_of_symmetric_proximity_measures","229745372_Component_evolution_a_secure_wireless_sensor_network","223057618_Characterizing_intersection_classes_of_graphs","222803532_Chordal_Graph_Models_of_Contingency_Tables","222606696_The_intersections_of_subtrees_in_a_tree_are_exactly_chordal_graphs","220345725_Random_intersection_graphs_when_m_on_An_equivalence_theorem_relating_the_evolution_of_the_Gn_m_p_and_Gn_p_models","220191408_Diameter_connectivity_and_phase_transition_of_the_uniform_random_intersection_graph","45880956_Equivalence_of_a_Random_Intersection_Graph_and_Gn_p","44329868_Algorithmic_graph_theory_and_perfect_graphs_Martin_Charles_Golumbic","43078880_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","4784752_Random_Intersection_Graphs_with_Tunable_Degree_Distribution_and_Clustering","1924327_Connectivity_of_the_Uniform_Random_Intersection_Graph","1910722_Asymptotic_Equivalence_and_Contiguity_of_Some_Random_Graphs","1762230_Epidemics_on_Random_Graphs_with_Tunable_Clustering"]}
