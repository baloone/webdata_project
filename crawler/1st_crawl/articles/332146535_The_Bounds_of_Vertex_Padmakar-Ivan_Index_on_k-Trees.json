{"id":"332146535_The_Bounds_of_Vertex_Padmakar-Ivan_Index_on_k-Trees","abstract":"The Padmakarâ€“Ivan ( P I ) index is a distance-based topological index and a molecular structure descriptor, which is the sum of the number of vertices over all edges u v of a graph such that these vertices are not equidistant from u and v. In this paper, we explore the results of P I -indices from trees to recursively clustered trees, the k-trees. Exact sharp upper bounds of PI indices on k-trees are obtained by the recursive relationships, and the corresponding extremal graphs are given. In addition, we determine the P I -values on some classes of k-trees and compare them, and our results extend and enrich some known conclusions.","authors":["Shaohui Wang","Zehui Shao","Jia-Bao Liu","Bing Wei"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7040324"],"references":["324853965_On_the_Maximum_ABC_Index_of_Graphs_With_Prescribed_Size_and_Without_Pendent_Vertices","318292802_Odd_mean_labeling_for_two_star_graph","313829277_Some_new_standard_graphs_labeled_by_3-total_edge_product_cordial_labeling","313125603_ba_Connectivity_Index_of_Graphs","312203024_A_sufficient_condition_for_the_existence_of_a_k-factor_excluding_a_given_r-factor","301841308_Cacti_with_Extremal_PI_Index","319123037_On_the_maximum_ABC_index_of_graphs_without_pendent_vertices","318352674_Bounds_on_the_P_I_index_of_unicyclic_and_bicyclic_graphs_with_given_girth","310595239_On_extremal_multiplicative_Zagreb_indices_of_trees_with_given_domination_number","303120625_A_formula_for_the_Wiener_number_of_trees_and_its_extension_to_graphs_containing_cycles"]}
