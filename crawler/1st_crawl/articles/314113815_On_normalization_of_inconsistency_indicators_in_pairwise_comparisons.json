{"id":"314113815_On_normalization_of_inconsistency_indicators_in_pairwise_comparisons","abstract":"In this study, we provide mathematical and practice-driven justification for using [0, 1] normalization of inconsistency indicators in pairwise comparisons. The need for normalization, as well as problems with the lack of normalization, are presented. A new type of paradox of infinity is described.","authors":["Waldemar Koczkodaj","Jean-Pierre Magnot","Jiří Mazurek","James F Peters"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 86(3/4):73-79","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2017.04.005","Projects: gauge theories, quantum gravity and decision theoryPairwise ComparisonResearch thought~A way to make friends with researchersConcluderTopology and Physics (my papers)Ranking and rating Procedures"],"references":["301790590_Computational_Proximity_Excursions_in_the_Topology_of_Digital_Images","262342575_On_the_quality_evaluation_of_scientific_entities_in_Poland_supported_by_consistency-driven_pairwise_comparisons_method","310483062_Pairwise_comparisons_simplified_published","303132337_On_the_method_of_paires_comparisons","301529199_Computational_Proximity","289378945_Pairwise_Comparisons_Rating_Scale_Paradox","285043345_Inconsistency_indicator_maps_on_groups_for_pairwise_comparisons","266964741_Essentials_of_topology_with_applications","265414258_On_the_Method_of_Paired_Comparisons","264960842_Theorie_De_L'addition_Des_Variables_Aleatoires"]}
