{"id":"266604863_Technical_Education_in_North_Eastern_India_Problems_and_prospects","abstract":"Ancient India, known for its rich cultural heritage boasted of housing world's largest Universities like Nalanda and Takshshila, where knowledge of wide range of subjects was imparted. Medieval India witnessed decline in traditional Indian systems and education during 'British India' saw the dominance of 'pre-Newtonian' and 'pre-Marxian' thinking based institutions, fit only to serve British interests.A new beginning was made with the creation of new temples of India i.e. IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) and host of other quality technical Institutes, giving boost to India's technical education. However these elite Institutions remained confined to only developed regions of the country and North Eastern states of India, characterized by underdevelopment remained isolated from these advancements. Development eluded these states in the absence of appropriate institutions to develop adequate human resource base. Limited institutions imparting technical education due to continuous negligence and inadequate infrastructural and other facilities are increasingly getting infected with numerous problems. This is affecting the overall development of these states, which otherwise holds very high promises and has potential to 'Turn economy of these states around'.Proposed paper is an attempt to study the problems these Technical Institutes of NE India are facing and also to suggest remedies to enhance their role in shaping India's destiny, which is emerging as a major player in new global economic order.","authors":["R M Pant"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
