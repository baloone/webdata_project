{"id":"325901366_Classroom_experience_report_on_jigsaw_learning","abstract":"Jigsaw learning is a cooperative learning technique enabling students to teach and learn from their peers. Although prior studies investigated the efficacy of Jigsaw learning in computing education by measuring student performance after Jigsaw activities, this work reports on student and instructor experiences with Jigsaw learning. Jigsaw activities were performed in lectures throughout the term and student experience data was collected through student surveys. The survey results reveal that 72% of survey respondents thought the Jigsaw activities helped their learning. Furthermore, 75% of respondents acknowledged their role in class as a more engaged learner and 44% of those students identified themselves as taking on the role of a teacher. The instructor found Jigsaw learning to be labor intensive but observed higher levels of student engagement.","authors":["Soohyun Nam Liao","William G.
