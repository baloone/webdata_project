{"id":"319159429_Empowering_Civic_Responsibility_Insights_From_Service_Learning","abstract":"The engaged scholarship has been widely viewed as academic service-learning and community service, which aim to link the classroom and community through courses with a transformative experiential education. It becomes an initiative to inculcate civic responsibility among students with the goal to produce responsible citizens and active participants in the community. This chapter will critically explore the main contribution of service learning to build civic responsibility. The literature review was conducted from referred books and journals on the topic of civic responsibility and service learning. As a core guideline to give a clear understanding and insightful view on the importance of the civic responsibility, this study could contribute to the significant insights towards different aspects of engaged scholarship and civic responsibility. Putting together awareness and goodwill from the community towards the group or organization should do with building civic engagement to get involved in social events to produce responsible citizens and active participants in the community.","authors":["Miftachul Huda","Kamarul Azmi Jasmi","Yabit Alas","Sari Qodriah"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.4018/978-1-5225-3649-9.ch007","In book: Engaged Scholarship and Civic Responsibility in Higher Education (pp.144-165)Publisher: IGI GlobalEditors: Sharon L.
