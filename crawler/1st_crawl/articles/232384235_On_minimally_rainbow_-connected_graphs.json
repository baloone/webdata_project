{"id":"232384235_On_minimally_rainbow_-connected_graphs","abstract":"An edge-coloured graph G is rainbow connected if any two vertices are connected by a path whose edges have distinct colours. A graph G is called rainbowk-connected if there is an edge colouring of G with k colours such that G is rainbow connected.In this paper we will study rainbow k-connected graphs with a minimum number of edges. For an integer n≥3 and 1≤k≤n−1 let t(n,k) denote the minimum size of a rainbow k-connected graph G of order n. We will compute exact values and upper bounds for t(n,k).Highlights► In this paper, edge colourings of graphs are considered. ► A path between two vertices whose edges are coloured distinctly is a rainbow path. ►G is called rainbow connected if all pairs of vertices have a rainbow path. ►G is called rainbow k-connected if the edges of G are coloured with k colours. ► We are studying rainbow k-connected graphs with a minimum number of edges.","authors":["Ingo Schiermeyer"],"meta":["March 2013Discrete Applied Mathematics 161(4-5):-","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2011.05.001"],"references":["316517492_On_the_minimum_number_of_edges_giving_maximum_oriented_chromatic_number","226829480_Homomorphisms_of_Edge-Colored_Graphs_and_Coxeter_Groups","221563877_Rainbow_Connection_in_Graphs_with_Minimum_Degree_Three","220468963_Graphs_with_rainbow_connection_number_two","220342507_On_Rainbow_Connection","29611740_Hardness_and_Algorithms_for_Rainbow_Connectivity","2277322_On_the_Minimum_Number_of_Edges_Giving_Maximum_Oriented_Chromatic_Number","281358338_A_matter_of_security","268496917_Rainbow_connection_in_graphs","220549038_The_Rainbow_Connection_of_a_Graph_Is_at_Most_Reciprocal_to_Its_Minimum_Degree"]}
