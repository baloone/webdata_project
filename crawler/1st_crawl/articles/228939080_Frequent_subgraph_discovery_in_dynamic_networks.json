{"id":"228939080_Frequent_subgraph_discovery_in_dynamic_networks","abstract":"In many application domains, graphs are utilized to model entities and their relationships, and graph mining is impor-tant to detect patterns within these relationships. While the majority of recent data mining techniques deal with static graphs that do not change over time, recent years have wit-nessed the advent of an increasing number of time series of graphs. In this paper, we define a novel framework to perform frequent subgraph discovery in dynamic networks. In particular, we are considering dynamic graphs with edge insertions and edge deletions over time. Existing subgraph mining algorithms can be easily integrated into our frame-work to make them handle dynamic graphs. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation on a large real-world case study confirms the practical feasibility of our approach.","authors":["Bianca Wackersreuther","Peter Wackersreuther","Annahita Oswald","Christian BÃ¶hm"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1145/1830252.1830272"],"references":["228807564_Mining_Temporally_Evolving_Graphs","313744319_Color_set_size_problem_with_application_to_string_matching","313518338_Network_motifs_in_the_transcriptional_regulation_network_of_Escherichia_coli","285472809_Network_motifs_in_the_transcriptional_regulation_network_of_Escherichiacoli","277457909_Systematic_Management_and_Analysis_of_Yeast_Gene_Expression_Data","228367092_Complete_Mining_of_Frequent_Patterns_from_Graphs_Mining_Graph_Data","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","221314122_Color_Set_Size_Problem_with_Application_to_String_Matching","220766289_Pattern_Mining_in_Frequent_Dynamic_Subgraphs","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
