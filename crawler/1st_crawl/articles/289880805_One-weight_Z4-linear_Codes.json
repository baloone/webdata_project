{"id":"289880805_One-weight_Z4-linear_Codes","abstract":"We show that, for every ordered pair of nonnegative integers (k\n1, k\n2), there exists a unique (up to equivalence) one-weight Z4-linear code of type 4k\n12k\n2. We derive an upper bound and a lower bound on the highest minimum distance between some extended one-weight Z4-linear codes and the Reed-Muller codes of order 1 and same lengths.","authors":["Claude Carlet"],"meta":["January 2000","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-57189-3_5","In book: Coding Theory, Cryptography and Related Areas (pp.57-72)"],"references":["242796716_Zsub_2k-linear_codes","270153282_Error-Correcting_Codes","268683218_Error-Correcting_Codes","265334005_Elementary_Hadamard_difference_sets","250969329_Bent_functions_on_a_finite_Abelian_group","247043128_On_mutual_correlation_of_sequences","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","235067405_Multi-Valued_Cross-Correlation_Functions_between_Two_Maximal_Linear_Recursive_Sequences","234781753_Analysis_and_Design_of_Stream_Ciphers","225584745_Linear_cryptanalysis_method_for_DES_cipher_III"]}
