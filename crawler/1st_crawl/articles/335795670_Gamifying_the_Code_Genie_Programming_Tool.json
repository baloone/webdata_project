{"id":"335795670_Gamifying_the_Code_Genie_Programming_Tool","abstract":"The Code Genie programming environment was built by the researcher and the author of this paper as part of a Ph.D. study to encourage high school students for coding in JavaScript language. This environment was tested and used in three coding workshops. The participating students had several suggestions in their feedback comments. One of the common suggestions was adding a tutorial section to the environment. Gamification elements and the suggested tutorial section were added to the Code Genie web Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This update is introduced and discussed in this paper.","authors":["Hadeel Mohammed Jawad"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1109/EIT.2019.8833771","Conference: 2019 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT)"],"references":["220094594_The_Greenfoot_Programming_Environment","328973447_The_Code_Genie_Programming_Environment","328972859_Integrating_Art_and_Animation_in_Teaching_Computer_Programming_for_High_School_Students_Experimental_Study","308602299_Blocks_at_your_fingertips_Blurring_the_line_between_blocks_and_text_in_GP","293813039_Free_Hugs_--_Praising_Developers_For_Their_Actions","244417333_Alice_Easy-to-Learn_3D_Scripting_for_Novices","240953629_Designing_the_user_interface_strategies_for_effective_human-computerinteraction"]}
