{"id":"3436143_A_survey_and_qualitative_analysis_of_MAC_protocols_for_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","abstract":"In order to avoid transmission collisions in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), a reliable and efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol is needed. Vehicular MANETs (VANETs) have vehicles as network nodes and their main characteristics are high mobility and speed. Active safety applications for VANETs need to establish reliable communications with minimal transmission collisions. Only few MAC protocols designed for MANETs can be adapted to efficiently work in VANETs. In this article we provide a short overview on some MANET MAC protocols, and then we summarize and qualitatively compare the ones suited for VANETs","authors":["Hamid Menouar","Fethi Filali","Massimiliano Lenardi"],"meta":["November 2006IEEE Wireless Communications 13(5):30 - 35","DOI:10.1109/WC-M.2006.250355","SourceIEEE Xplore","Project: Research at HITACHI"],"references":["242382833_A_system_for_broadcast_communication_reservation-ALOHA","224085105_A_Survey_classification_and_comparative_analysis_of_medium_access_control_protocols_for_ad_hoc_networks","220293296_ADHOC_MAC_New_MAC_Architecture_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks_Providing_Efficient_and_Reliable_Point-to-Point_and_Broadcast_Services","4003157_A_busy-tone_based_directional_MAC_protocol_for_ad_hoc_networks","238650920_802_11_Wireless_Networks_The_Definitive_Guide","224638053_A_two-channel_medium_access_control_protocol_for_mobile_ad_hoc_networks_using_directional_antennas","221628432_A_MAC_protocol_for_full_exploitation_of_Directional_Antennas_in_Ad-hoc_Wireless_Networks","220926714_Reliable_MAC_broadcast_protocol_in_directional_and_omni-directional_transmission_for_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","220250248_Wireless_Medium_Access_Control_Protocols","3889064_A_MAC_protocol_for_Mobile_ad_hoc_networks_using_directional_antennas"]}
