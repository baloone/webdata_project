{"id":"294816822_Speech_act_annotation","abstract":"Introduction Any type of linguistic annotation is a highly complex and interpretive process, but none more so than pragmatic annotation. The complexity inherent in this task (Leech et al. 2000) is mainly due to the fact that this type of annotation, unlike, for example, POS (part-of-speech) or semantic tagging/annotation, almost always needs to take into account levels above the individual word and may even need to refer to contextual information beyond those textual units that are commonly referred to as a ‘sentence’ or ‘utterance’. This is also why, in order to be able to produce large-scale and consistently annotated corpora, it is highly advisable to automate such an annotation process. This chapter, apart from providing an overview of, and guidelines for, representing and annotating pragmatic and other, ‘pragmatics-relevant’ information, will do so in the form of research into which means may be available to improve existing techniques (e.g. Stolcke et al. 2000 and Weisser 2002, 2003, 2004) for manual and automatic pragmatic annotation of corpora from different domains. One major part of this will be to try and determine the extent to which it is possible to improve the identification and subsequent annotation of pragmatics-related phenomena, based on insights gained from attempts at manual and automatic annotation. In so doing, I shall draw on a small set of materials from a number of annotated corpora that are freely available online, conducting an in-depth analysis of one file from each corpus (filenames provided below), with additional data from the corpora being consulted as and when necessary.","authors":["Martin Weisser"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1017/CBO9781139057493.005","Projects: Dialogue Annotation Survey & GuidelinesDART Development and Application"],"references":["316675092_Oh_Not_a_Lot_Discourse_intonation_and_vague_language","316269034_English_Grammar_for_Today","304728749_'This_We_Have_Done'_The_Vagueness_of_Poetry_and_Public_Relations","304728745_'Und_Tralala'_Vagueness_and_General_Extenders_in_German_and_New_Zealand_English","304728744_Vague_Language_as_a_Means_of_Self-Protective_Avoidance_Tension_Management_in_Conference_Talks","304728687_Caught_Between_Professional_Requirements_and_Interpersonal_Needs_Vague_Language_in_Healthcare_Contexts","304728686_'I_Think_He_Was_Kind_of_Shouting_or_Something'_Uses_and_Abuses_of_Vagueness_in_the_British_Courtroom","304728502_'Well_Maybe_Not_Exactly_but_It's_Around_Fifty_Basically'_Vague_Language_in_Mathematics_Classrooms","304728500_'About_Twelve_Thousand_or_So'_Vagueness_in_North_American_and_UK_Offices","304728499_'Looking_Out_for_Love_and_All_the_Rest_of_It'_Vague_Category_Markers_as_Shared_Social_Space"]}
