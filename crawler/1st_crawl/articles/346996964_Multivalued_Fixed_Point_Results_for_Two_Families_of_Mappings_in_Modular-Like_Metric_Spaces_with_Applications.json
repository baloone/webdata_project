Some new results in graph theory for multigraph-dominated contractions in modular-like metric spaces are developed. An application has been presented to ensure the uniqueness and existence of a solution of families of nonlinear integral equations.\n\n1. Introduction and Preliminaries\nIf the image of a point under two mappings is itself, then is called a common fixed point of those mappings. Theory of fixed point has a basic role in analysis (see [1â€“39]). Chistyakov [7] established the concept of modular metric spaces and showed briefly about modular convergence, convex modular, equivalent metrics, abstract convex cone, and metric semigroup. Padcharoen et al. [16] introduced the concept of -type -contractions in modular metric spaces and discussed some related results. Further results on these spaces in different directions can be seen in [6, 13, 14].\nIn this paper, we establish some common fixed point theorems for two families of set-valued mappings satisfying a generalized contraction on a sequence only in a more generalized setting of modular-like metric spaces. New results can be established in dislocated metric spaces, ordered spaces, partial metric spaces, and metric spaces as a consequence of our findings. To support our results, some applications and examples are discussed. We give the following preliminary concepts which will be used in our results.\nDefinition 1. (see [16]). Let . A function is called a modular-like metric on if for all , , and , it satisfies(i) for all (ii) for all and then (iii) for all If we replace (ii) by for all if and only if , then becomes a modular metric on . If we replace (ii) by for some and then , then becomes a regular modular metric on . For and , is a closed ball in . We will use . space instead of modular-like metric space.\nDefinition 2. (see [16]). Let be an . space.(i) is known as -complete if for any sequence in and for some , as implies as for some (ii)The sequence in is known as -Cauchy for some if as (iii)The sequence in is known as -convergent to for some if and only if as\nDefinition 3. Let be an . space and . A member which belongs to is said to be a best approximation in for ifIf each has a best approximation in , then is known as a proximinal set. is equal to the family of proximinal sets in . Let and for all . Define a set ; then, for each ,Hence, 4 is the best approximation in for each . Also, is a proximinal set.\nDefinition 4. The set-valued mapping , defined byis known as -Hausdorff metric. The pair is called the -Hausdorff metric space. Let and for all . If and , then .\nDefinition 5. Let be a modular-like metric space. Then, we will say that satisfies the -condition if it is the case that , for implies for some .\nDefinition 6. (see [33]). Let , be a set-valued mapping, , and . Then, is called -admissible on if whenever , for all .\nDefinition 7. Let , be a set-valued mapping, , and . Then, is called -dominated on if for all .\nDefinition 8. (see [39]). Consider a metric space . A function is said -contraction if for all , there exists such that implieswhere is a mapping which satisfies the following: (F1) There exists such that (F2) For all such that , , that is, is strictly increasing (F3) if and only if , for each sequence of positive numbersThe family of all mappings satisfying conditions (F1) to (F3) is denoted by .\nLemma 1. Let be an . space. Let be a Hausdorff -metric-like space. Then, for each and for all , there exists such that .\nProof. If , then for each . As is the proximinal set, for every , there exists at least one best approximation which satisfies . Now, we have . Now,Hence proved.\nExample 1. (see [21]). Let . Define byDefine byThen, and are not -admissible, but they are -dominated.\n\n2. Main Results\nLet be an . space and ; let and be two families of multifunctions from to . Let be an element such that .

By the definition of -dominated mappings, we have and for all and . As , this implies Also, for some , so . Also, for some . Now, by using Lemma 1, we haveThis impliesNow, ifthen from (10), we havea contradiction. Therefore,for all . Hence, from (10), we haveSimilarly, we havefor all . By (14) and (15), we haveRepeating these steps, we getSimilarly, we haveInequalities (17) and (18) can jointly be written asTaking the limit as in (19), we haveSince ,Applying the property (F1) of , there exists such thatBy (19), for all , we obtainConsidering (21) and (22) and letting in (23), we haveSince (24) holds, there exists such that for all orTake and ; then,Applying the limit as on both sides, we haveAs , then , and so,As , thenSince satisfies the -condition, we haveHence, is a Cauchy sequence in . Since is a regular complete modular-like metric space, there exists such that as , and so,Now, by Lemma 1, we havefor some and some . Now, there exists such that . From the assumption, . Assume that ; then, there must be a positive real number such that for . Now, ; then, by using inequality (8), we haveLetting and using (31), we getSince is strictly increasing, (32) impliesThis is not true. So, our assumption is wrong. Hence, or for each . Similarly, by proceeding with Lemma 1 and inequality (8), we can prove that or for all . Hence, is a common fixed point of both the mappings and in for all and .\nExample 2. Let . Take and for all .

So, the families and have a common fixed point.\nIf we take in Theorem 1, then we obtain the above result.\nCorollary 1. Let be a complete . space. Assume that is regular and satisfies the -condition. Let , , and be a family of -dominated set-valued functions on . If there exist and such thatwhenever , , , and , then the sequence generated by converges to , and for each , . Also, if satisfies (44) and either or for every , then has a common fixed point in .\n\n3. Applications in Graph Theory\nJachymski [11] developed a relation between fixed point theory and graph theory by the induction of graphic contractions. Hussain et al. [9] established some results for the new type of contractions endowed with a graph and also showed an application. Further useful results on the graph can be seen in [34, 35, 40].\nDefinition 9.

By the definition of the graph dominated on , we have for all and for each . So, for all and for every . This means that and . Hence, and for every . So, the families of mappings are -dominated on . Furthermore, inequality (45) can be expressed aswhenever , , and . Also, (ii) holds. Then, by Theorem 1, we have is a sequence in , and . Now, , and either or implies that either or . So, all the requirements of Theorem 1 are satisfied. Hence, from Theorem 1, and have a common fixed point in , and .\n\n4. Results on Single-Valued Mappings\nIn this section, some consequences of our results related to single-valued mappings in . spaces have been discussed. Let be an . space, , and be two families of mappings. Let , , and . Adopting this way, we make a sequence in so that and , where . We represent this kind of iterative sequence by . We say that is a sequence in generated by . If , then we denote instead of .\nTheorem 3. Let be a complete . space. Assume that is regular and satisfies the -condition. Let , , , and , be two families of -dominated mappings from to . Then, there exist and such thatwhenever , , , , and .\nThen, is a sequence in , for each and . Also, if satisfies (47) and either or for all , then and have a common fixed point in for every and .\nProof. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 1.\nIf we take in Theorem 3, then we can get the following result.\nCorollary 2. Let be a complete . space.

Then, is a sequence in , for each , and . Also, if satisfies (48) and either or for each , then is the fixed point of in for every .\n\n5. Application in Integral Equations\nIn this section, we discuss the application of our work in integral equations. First of all, we present our main result without a closed ball for self-mappings and without -dominated functions and then apply it to attain an application in integral equations. We also discuss the uniqueness.\nTheorem 4. Let be a complete . space. Assume that is regular and satisfies the -condition. Let and and be the families of self-mappings. Then, there exist and a strictly increasing function such thatwhenever , , , and . Then, . Also, if inequality (49) holds for , then and have a unique common fixed point in for all and .\nProof. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 1. We prove only uniqueness. Let and have another common fixed point . Suppose . Then,This implies thatwhich is not true. So, . Hence, .\nLet be the set of all continuous functions on . Consider the families of integral equationsfor all , , , and are the functions from to . For , define the supremum norm as , where is arbitrarily taken. Definefor all ; with these settings, becomes a complete . space.\nNow, we prove the following theorem to ensure the uniqueness and existence of a solution of families of nonlinear integral equations (52) and (53).\nTheorem 5. Assume the following constraints are satisfied:(i) and are two families of mappings from to .(ii)DefineSuppose there exists such thatfor all and , whereThen, integral equations (52) and (53) have a unique solution.\nProof. By assumption (ii),This implieswhich further impliesSo, all the requirements of Theorem 5 are satisfied for ; and . Hence, two families of integral equations given in (52) and (53) have a unique common solution.\n\n6. Conclusion\nIn this article, we have achieved some new results for set-valued mappings belonging to two families which satisfy generalized rational-type Wardowskiâ€™s contraction. Dominated mappings are applied to find out the fixed point results. Applications in the subject of integral equations and graph theory are presented. Moreover, we investigate our results in new generalized modular-like metric spaces. Many consequences of our results in dislocated metric spaces, metric spaces, and partial metric spaces (even with a partial order) can be established easily.\n\nData Availability\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\nAuthorsâ€™ Contributions\nEach author contributed equally to this paper, read, and approved the final manuscript.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank the Basque Government for supporting this work through Grant IT1207-19.","authors":["Tahair Rasham","Abdullah Shoaib","Choonkil Park","Manuel De la Sen"],"meta":["November 2020Complexity 2020(136):1-10","DOI:10.1155/2020/2690452"],"references":["341719822_On_Best_Proximity_Point_Results_for_Some_Type_of_Mappings","340846702_Fixed_Point_Results_for_a_Generalized_F-Contractive_Mappings_on_Closed_Ball_with_Application","340070588_Hybrid_Ciric_Type_Graphic_YL-Contraction_Mappings_with_Applications_to_Electric_Circuit_and_Fractional_Differential_Equations","338608231_Fixed_point_results_via_a_Hausdorff_controlled_type_metric","338534185_Numerical_Functional_Analysis_and_Optimization_Best_Proximity_Points_of_MT-Cyclic_Contractions_with_Property_UC_Best_Proximity_Points_of_MT_-Cyclic_Contractions_with_Property_UC","338116576_On_Fixed_Point_Results_for_a_-ps-_Dominated_Fuzzy_Contractive_Mappings_with_Graph","336013163_Common_Fixed_Point_Results_for_Two_Families_of_Multivalued_A-Dominated_Contractive_Mappings_on_Closed_Ball_With_Application","334519505_Fixed_Points_for_a_Pair_of_F-Dominated_Contractive_Mappings_in_Rectangular_b-Metric_Spaces_with_Graph","333668127_Sufficient_Conditions_to_Solve_Two_Systems_of_Integral_Equations_Via_Fixed_Point_Results","355328063_Wardowski_type_contractions_with_applications_on_caputo_type_nonlinear_fractional_differential_equations"]}
