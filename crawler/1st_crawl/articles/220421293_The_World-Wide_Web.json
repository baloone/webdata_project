It aims to allow information sharing within internationally dispersed groups of users, and the creation and dissemination of information by support groups. W3's ability to provide implementation-independent access to data and documentation is ideal for a large HEP collaboration. W3 now defines the state of the art in networked information retrieval, for user support, resource discovery and collaborative work. W3 originated at CERN and is in use at CERN, FNAL, NIKHEF, SLAC and other laboratories. This paper gives a brief overview and reports the current status of the project.
