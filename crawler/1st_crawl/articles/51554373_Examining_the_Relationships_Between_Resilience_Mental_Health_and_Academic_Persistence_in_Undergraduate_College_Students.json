{"id":"51554373_Examining_the_Relationships_Between_Resilience_Mental_Health_and_Academic_Persistence_in_Undergraduate_College_Students","abstract":"In this study, the relationships between measures of interpersonal resilience, intrapersonal resilience, and mental health were examined with respect to academic and social integration, key determinants of academic persistence.\nA sample (n = 605) of undergraduate students was recruited from 2 midwestern universities during the 2007-2008 academic year.\nHierarchal (or sequential) regression analysis examined whether the inter- and intrapersonal resilience and mental health measures contributed to explaining variance in the response variables of university cumulative grade point average (GPA) and university sense of belonging.\nThe intrapersonal resilience factors contributed to explaining variance in cumulative GPA in addition to aptitude and achievement. Furthermore, there was a strong statistical correlation between the inter- and intrapersonal resilience factors and mental health.\nThe demands in college are significant and there is a need for more research on the concept of resilience as it relates to college health and academic persistence.","authors":["Michael T.
