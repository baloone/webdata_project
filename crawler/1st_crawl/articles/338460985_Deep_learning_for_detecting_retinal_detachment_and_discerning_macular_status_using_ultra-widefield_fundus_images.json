{"id":"338460985_Deep_learning_for_detecting_retinal_detachment_and_discerning_macular_status_using_ultra-widefield_fundus_images","abstract":"Retinal detachment can lead to severe visual loss if not treated timely. The early diagnosis of retinal detachment can improve the rate of successful reattachment and the visual results, especially before macular involvement. Manual retinal detachment screening is time-consuming and labour-intensive, which is difficult for large-scale clinical applications. In this study, we developed a cascaded deep learning system based on the ultra-widefield fundus images for automated retinal detachment detection and macula-on/off retinal detachment discerning. The performance of this system is reliable and comparable to an experienced ophthalmologist. In addition, this system can automatically provide guidance to patients regarding appropriate preoperative posturing to reduce retinal detachment progression and the urgency of retinal detachment repair. The implementation of this system on a global scale may drastically reduce the extent of vision impairment resulting from retinal detachment by providing timely identification and referral. Li et al. develop a cascaded deep learning system for automated retinal detachment and macular status detection based on ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) images. With reliable and comparable performance to an experienced opthamologist, this system can also provide guidance to patients regarding appropriate preoperative posturing to reduce RD progression.","authors":["Zhongwen Li","Chong Guo","Danyao Nie","Duoru Lin"],"meta":["January 2020Communications Biology 3(1):15","DOI:10.1038/s42003-019-0730-x"],"references":["332001575_The_Effect_of_Compliance_With_Preoperative_Posturing_Advice_and_Head_Movements_on_the_Progression_of_Macula-On_Retinal_Detachment","323531797_Efficacy_of_a_Deep_Learning_System_for_Detecting_Glaucomatous_Optic_Neuropathy_Based_on_Color_Fundus_Photographs","319276676_Accuracy_of_deep_learning_a_machine-learning_technology_using_ultra-wide-field_fundus_ophthalmoscopy_for_detecting_rhegmatogenous_retinal_detachment","316839521_Preoperative_Posturing_of_Patients_with_Macula-On_Retinal_Detachment_Reduces_Progression_Toward_the_Fovea","329121798_DeepSeeNet_A_Deep_Learning_Model_for_Automated_Classification_of_Patient-based_Age-related_Macular_Degeneration_Severity_from_Color_Fundus_Photographs","324421328_A_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_Prediction_of_Age-Related_Eye_Disease_Study_Severity_Scale_for_Age-Related_Macular_Degeneration_from_Color_Fundus_Photography","323373904_Identifying_Medical_Diagnoses_and_Treatable_Diseases_by_Image-Based_Deep_Learning","321873183_Automated_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Image_Assessment_Softwares_Diagnostic_Accuracy_and_Cost-Effectiveness_Compared_to_Human_Graders","321755280_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_System_for_Diabetic_Retinopathy_and_Related_Eye_Diseases_Using_Retinal_Images_From_Multiethnic_Populations_With_Diabetes","320223300_Grader_Variability_and_the_Importance_of_Reference_Standards_for_Evaluating_Machine_Learning_Models_for_Diabetic_Retinopathy"]}
