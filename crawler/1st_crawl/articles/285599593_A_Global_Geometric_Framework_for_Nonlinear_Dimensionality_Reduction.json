{"id":"285599593_A_Global_Geometric_Framework_for_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction","abstract":"Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human\ngene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures\nhidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting\nfrom its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality\nreduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set.\nUnlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is\ncapable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting\nor images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction,\nours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge\nasymptotically to the true structure.","authors":["Joshua B.
