{"id":"348744077_An_Action-Selection_Policy_Generator_for_Reinforcement_Learning_Hardware_Accelerators","abstract":"We propose the first hardware architecture for an action-selection Policy Generator feasible for Reinforcement Learning hardware accelerators. The system is capable of producing outputs for random, greedy and Îµ-greedy action-selection policies within the same circuit. It requires a very moderate number of hardware resources, shows a limited power dissipation, and can be integrated in the state of the art of Reinforcement Learning hardware accelerators due to its high computational speed. Our architecture is meant to work with Q-Matrix based Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as Q-Learning and SARSA.","authors":["Gian Carlo Cardarilli","Luca Di Nunzio","Rocco Fazzolari","Daniele Giardino"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-66729-0_32","In book: Applications in Electronics Pervading Industry, Environment and Society (pp.267-272)"],"references":["342467493_Indoor_Localization_System_Based_on_Bluetooth_Low_Energy_for_Museum_Applications","338108600_An_Efficient_Hardware_Implementation_of_Reinforcement_Learning_The_Q-Learning_Algorithm","337182145_Small_Lung_Nodules_Detection_Based_on_Fuzzy-Logic_and_Probabilistic_Neural_Network_With_Bioinspired_Reinforcement_Learning","335500270_A_Reinforcement_Learning_Based_QAMPSK_Symbol_Synchronizer","329634530_Parallel_Implementation_of_Reinforcement_Learning_Q-Learning_Technique_for_FPGA","311486379_Comparing_Exploration_Strategies_for_Q-learning_in_Random_Stochastic_Mazes","231745266_An_hybrid_neuro-wavelet_approach_for_long-term_prediction_of_solar_wind","220344150_Technical_Note_Q-Learning","2500611_On-Line_Q-Learning_Using_Connectionist_Systems","342012380_Decentralized_multi-agent_based_energy_management_of_microgrid_using_reinforcement_learning","339466096_QTAccel_A_Generic_FPGA_based_Design_for_Q-Table_based_Reinforcement_Learning_Accelerators","331496949_Q-RTS_a_Real-Time_Swarm_Intelligence_based_on_Multi-Agent_Q-Learning","320221220_A_New_Deep-Q-Learning-Based_Transmission_Scheduling_Mechanism_for_the_Cognitive_Internet_of_Things","303358834_Gait_Balance_and_Acceleration_of_a_Biped_Robot_Based_on_Q-Learning","5596000_Reinforcement_Learning_An_Introduction"]}
