{"id":"304005682_The_next_bibliometrics_ALMetrics_Author_Level_Metrics_and_the_multiple_faces_of_author_impact","abstract":"The main goal of this article is to describe the purpose and content of a new branch of bibliometrics: ALMetrics (Author- Level Metrics). ALMetrics is focused on the quantitative analysis of an author’s performance by measuring the dimensions of their intellectual activity as shown through varied metric indicators. This article will list, define, and classify the different metrics that are offered in newer information portals that showcase the scientific activity of authors. These metrics are grouped into five sets: bibliometrics (publication and citation), usage, participation, rating, social connectivity, and composite indicators. This new bibliometric specialty is necessary because of new trends in scientific assessment, which have moved analysis away from old bibliometrics (based on journal analysis and Impact Factor) towards new bibliometrics that analyze both documents and authors via a mix of indicators. Most importantly, ALMetrics responds to the researchers’ desire for both knowledge and acknowledgement.","authors":["Enrique Orduna-Malea","Alberto Martín-Martín","Emilio Delgado López-Cózar"],"meta":["June 2016El Profesional de la Informacion 25(3):485","DOI:10.3145/epi.2016.may.18"],"references":["307614976_How_readers_discover_content_in_scholarly_publications","302918932_Thomson_Reuters_utiliza_altmetricas_usage_counts_para_los_articulos_indizados_en_la_Web_of_Science","299460397_ResearchGate_como_fuente_de_evaluacion_cientifica_desvelando_sus_aplicaciones_bibliometricas","291126206_The_counting_house_measuring_those_who_count_Presence_of_Bibliometrics_Scientometrics_Informetrics_Webometrics_and_Altmetrics_in_Google_Scholar_Citations_ResearcherID_ResearchGate_Mendeley_Twitter","276057813_101_Innovations_in_Scholarly_Communication_-_the_Changing_Research_Workflow","268445074_The_silent_fading_of_an_academic_search_engine_The_case_of_Microsoft_Academic_Search","264459157_New_data_new_possibilities_Exploring_the_insides_of_Altmetriccom","236455602_Coverage_and_adoption_of_altmetrics_sources_in_the_bibliometric_community","264798361_Online_collaboration_Scientists_and_the_social_network","251238235_Mendeley_Readership_Altmetrics_for_the_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities_Research_Evaluation_and_Knowledge_Flows"]}
