{"id":"340960954_Feasibility_of_on-line_speed_policies_in_real-time_systems","abstract":"We consider a real-time system where a single processor with variable speed executes an infinite sequence of sporadic and independent jobs. We assume that job sizes and relative deadlines are bounded by C and \\(\\varDelta \\) respectively. Furthermore, \\(S_{\\max }\\) denotes the maximal speed of the processor. In such a real-time system, a speed selection policy dynamically chooses (i.e., on-line) the speed of the processor to execute the current, not yet finished, jobs. We say that an on-line speed policy is feasible if it is able to execute any sequence of jobs while meeting two constraints: the processor speed is always below \\(S_{\\max }\\) and no job misses its deadline. In this paper, we compare the feasibility region of four on-line speed selection policies in single-processor real-time systems, namely Optimal Available \\({\\text{(OA)}}\\) (Yao et al. in IEEE annual foundations of computer science, 1995), Average Rate \\({\\text{(AVR)}}\\) (Yao et al. 1995), \\({\\text{(BKP)}}\\) (Bansal in J ACM 54:1, 2007), and a Markovian Policy based on dynamic programming \\({\\text{(MP)}}\\) (Gaujal in Technical Report hal-01615835, Inria, 2017). We prove the following results:\n\\( {\\text{(OA)}}\\) is feasible if and only if \\(S_{\\max } \\ge C (h_{\\varDelta -1}+1)\\), where \\(h_n\\) is the n-th harmonic number (\\(h_n = \\sum _{i=1}^n 1/i \\approx \\log n\\)).\n\\({\\text{(AVR)}}\\) is feasible if and only if \\(S_{\\max } \\ge C h_\\varDelta \\).\n\\({\\text{(BKP)}}\\) is feasible if and only if \\(S_{\\max } \\ge e C\\) (where \\(e = \\exp (1)\\)).\n\\({\\text{(MP)}}\\) is feasible if and only if \\(S_{\\max } \\ge C\\). This is an optimal feasibility condition because when \\(S_{\\max } < C\\) no policy can be feasible.\nThis reinforces the interest of \\({\\text{(MP)}}\\) that is not only optimal for energy consumption (on average) but is also optimal regarding feasibility.","authors":["Bruno Gaujal","Alain Girault","StÃ©phan Plassart"],"meta":["July 2020Real-Time Systems 56(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11241-020-09347-y"],"references":["342642327_Dynamic_Speed_Scaling_Minimizing_Expected_Energy_Consumption_for_Real-Time_Tasks","270960086_Reinforcement_learning","324284081_Markov_Decision_Processes_Discrete_Stochastic_Dynamic_Programming","251329916_Sur_une_maniere_d'etendre_le_theoreme_de_la_moyenne_aux_equations_differentielles_du_premier_ordre","230887855_Markov_Decision_Processes_Discrete_Stochastic_Dynamic_Programming","221298903_Feasibility_Analysis_of_On-Line_DVS_Algorithms_for_Scheduling_Arbitrary_Event_Streams","220432409_Speed_scaling_to_manage_energy_and_temperature","220431427_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multiprogramming_in_Hard-Real-Time_Environment","4109400_Optimal_Power-Down_Strategies","3855501_Real-time_calculus_for_scheduling_hard_real-time_systems","2916574_Procrastination_Scheduling_in_Fixed_Priority_Real-Time_Systems","3635304_A_scheduling_model_for_reduced_CPU_energy"]}
