{"id":"327397705_A_Comparative_Study_of_the_Decisional_Needs_Engineering_Approaches","abstract":"Requirements Engineering (RE) is an important phase in a project of systems development. It helps design-analysts to design and to model the expression of the end-user needs, and their expectations vis-a-vis their future system. This engineering is studying two major issues that are: What should the system do in order to have a complete needs specification, and reason on the why: \"Why do we need to build this system? \", without looking for how to build it. The vast majority of needs engineering approaches are based on two concepts: scenario or goal; there are generally three types of approaches: Scenario-Oriented Approaches, Goal-Oriented Approaches and approaches generated by the couple: goals and scenarios at the same time. In the remainder of this paper, we present a comparative study of the three types of the RE approaches, then models of needs representation, and finally we conclude with the conclusions.
