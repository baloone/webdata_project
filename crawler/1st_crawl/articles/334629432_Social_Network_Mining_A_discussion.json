{"id":"334629432_Social_Network_Mining_A_discussion","abstract":"Social network is model in order to structuring social. In knowledge management, social structures need to be revealed to see social behavior and social change based on the interactions that have taken place. In knowledge technology, the semantic social structure is extracted from information sources to interpret social behavior and its changes, and the meaning is supported by social network analysis. However, social networks do not only reveal social structures and manage them, but social recognition by exploring the potential of social members (social actors) and the community so as to present competitiveness. Competence is defined by the existence of social actors, while the existence of social actors is expressed from the relationship between them whereby the relationship also proves the meaning the competence. By involving artificial intelligence (AI), the meaning can be affirmed in a variety of different ways depending on the treatment given to the source of information so that it is possible to predict and express on the characteristics and behavior of the data. It based on forensic data and information retrieval, for trusty information is generated. Moreover, social network mining is present by considering social network data and the resultant of extraction method so that social networks not only contain information but become knowledge. This serves to bridge the social network analysis gap based on primary and secondary data, so social engineering is possible by exploring all the potential presented by social network extraction.","authors":["Mahyuddin K.
