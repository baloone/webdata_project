{"id":"346926190_A_rate_threshold_mechanism_regulates_MAPK_stress_signaling_and_survival","abstract":"Cells are exposed to changes in extracellular stimulus concentration that vary as a function of rate. However, the effect of stimulation rate on cell behavior and signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we examined how varying the rate of stress application alters budding yeast cell viability and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling at the single-cell level. We show that cell survival and signaling depend on a rate threshold that operates in conjunction with a concentration threshold to determine the timing of MAPK signaling during rate-varying stimulus treatments. We also discovered that the stimulation rate threshold is sensitive to changes in the expression levels of the Ptp2 phosphatase, but not of another phosphatase that similarly regulates osmostress signaling during switch-like treatments. Our results demonstrate that stimulation rate is a regulated determinant of signaling output and provide a paradigm to guide the dissection of major stimulation rate-dependent mechanisms in other systems.","authors":["Amanda N.
