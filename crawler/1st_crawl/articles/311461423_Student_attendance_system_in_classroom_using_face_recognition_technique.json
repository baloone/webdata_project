{"id":"311461423_Student_attendance_system_in_classroom_using_face_recognition_technique","abstract":"Authentication is one of the significant issues in the era of information system. Among other things, human face recognition (HFR) is one of known techniques which can be used for user authentication. As an important branch of biometric verification, HFR has been widely used in many applications, such as video monitoring/surveillance system, human-computer interaction, door access control system and network security. This paper proposes a method for student attendance system in classroom using face recognition technique by combining Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to extract the features of student's face which is followed by applying Radial Basis Function (RBF) for classifying the facial objects. From the experiments which is conducted by involving 16 students situated in classroom setting, it results in 121 out of 148 successful faces recognition.","authors":["Samuel Lukas","Aditya Mitra","Ririn Ikana Desanti","Dion Krisnadi"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763360","Conference: 2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)"],"references":["274313938_Implementation_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_and_Radial_Basis_Function_Neural_Network_in_Facial_Image_Recognition","266297178_Image_Compression_Using_Wavelet_Transform_Based_on_the_Lifting_Scheme_and_its_Implementation","242275100_The_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_DCT_Theory_and_Application1","233823802_Further_Tests_for_Face_Recognition_Using_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_And_Hidden_Markov_Model","3782160_Face_recognition_using_a_DCT-HMM_approach","340628556_Verilog_Implementation_of_Image_Compression_Using_Discrete_Wavelet_Transform","330250554_Implementing_Discrete_Wavelet_and_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_with_Radial_Basis_Function_Neural_Network_in_Facial_Image_Recognition","290299710_Face_recognition_based_on_haar_wavelet_transform_and_principal_component_analysis_via_levenberg-marquardt_backpropagation_neural_network","283793502_Face_Recognition_by_Classification_using_Radial_Basis_Function","256075302_Eigenfaces_for_Recognition"]}
