{"id":"292129096_Digital_inpainting_based_on_the_Mumford-Shah-Euler_image_model","abstract":"Image inpainting is an image restoration problem, in which image models play a critical role, as demonstrated by Chan, Kang & Shen's [12] recent inpainting schemes based on the bounded variation and the elastica [11] image models. In this paper, we propose two novel inpainting models based on the Mumford-Shah image model [41], and its high order correction-the Mumford-Shah-Euler image model. We also present their efficient numerical realization based on the Gamma-convergence approximations of Ambrosio & Tortorelli [2, 3] and De Giorgi [21].","authors":["S Esedoglu","Jackie Jianhong Shen"],"meta":["August 2002European Journal of Applied Mathematics 13:353-370","DOI:10.1017/S0956792501004904"],"references":["222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","41224935_Optimal_approximation_by_piecewise_smooth_function_and_associated_variational_problems","5595728_Filling-in_by_joint_interpolation_of_vector_fields_and_gray_levels","5576289_An_axiomatic_approach_to_image_interpolation","3611738_Total_variation_based_image_restoration_with_free_local_constraints","244460836_Error_concealment_technique_using_data_for_block-based_image_coding","242144031_Nonuniform_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_in_Shift-Invariant_Spaces","227891248_Tortorelli_V_On_the_approximation_of_functionals_depending_on_jumps_by_elliptic_functionals_via_G-convergence_Commun_Pure_Appl_Math_438_999-1036","223871436_A_variational_method_for_the_recovery_of_smooth_boundaries","222802754_Visual_reconstruction_with_discontinuities_using_variational_methods","222456655_Fronts_Propagating_with_Curvature_Dependent_Speed_Algorithms_Based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi","5602019_MOMS_Maximal-order_interpolation_of_minimal_support","3774547_Level_Lines_Based_Disocclusion","3327439_New_edge-directed_interpolation","3327414_Curve_evolution_implementation_of_the_Mumford-Shah_functional_for_image_segmentation_denoising_interpolation_and_magnification","3326369_Detection_of_missing_data_in_image_sequences","3326359_Detection_of_missing_data_in_image_sequences"]}
