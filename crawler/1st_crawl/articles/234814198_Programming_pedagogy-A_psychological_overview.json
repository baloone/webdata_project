{"id":"234814198_Programming_pedagogy-A_psychological_overview","abstract":"Can we turn novices into experts in a four year undergraduate program? If so, how? If not, what is the best we can do? While every teacher has his/her own opinion on these questions, psychological studies over the last twenty years have started to furnish scientific answers. Unfortunately, little of these results have been incorporated into curricula or textbooks. This report is a brief overview of some of the more important results concerning computer programming and how they can affect course design.","authors":["Leon E.
