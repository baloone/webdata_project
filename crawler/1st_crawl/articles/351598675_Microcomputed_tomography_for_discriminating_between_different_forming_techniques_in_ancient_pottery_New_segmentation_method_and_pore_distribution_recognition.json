Analysing pottery 3‐D images is a challenging issue, the data being extremely noisy and heterogeneous.\nQuantitative criteria are introduced for the characterisation of a previously unrecognised pottery building method, the Spiralled Patchwork Technology (SPT).\nAn analytical protocol has been implemented which applies to 3‐D reconstructions of ceramic sherds and integrates automatic segmentation of porous systems and shape recognition using Hough transform. It enables discriminating between SPT and other techniques for vessels manufacture, and opens up many perspectives for independent characterisation of ancient technical gestures in ceramic technology.","authors":["Vanna Lisa Coli","Louise Gomart","Didier Pisani","Serge Cohen"],"meta":["May 2021Archaeometry","DOI:10.1111/arcm.12693"],"references":["335021384_Application_of_Image_Analysis_for_the_Identification_of_Prehistoric_Ceramic_Production_Technologies_in_the_North_Caucasus_Russia_BronzeIron_Age","321629732_Spiralled_Patchwork_in_Pottery_Manufacture_and_the_Introduction_of_Farming_to_Southern_Europe","319279171_Recognition_of_feature_curves_on_3D_shapes_using_an_algebraic_approach_to_Hough_transforms","318529811_Iterative_Hough_Transform_for_Line_Detection_in_3D_Point_Clouds","314189028_Looking_into_houses_analysis_of_LBK_ceramic_technological_change_on_a_household_level","346624758_A_Neolithic_without_dairy_Chemical_evidence_from_the_content_of_ceramics_from_the_Pendimoun_rock-shelter_Castellar_France_5750-5150_BCE","337810543_First_farming_in_the_North-Western_Mediterranean_Evidence_from_Castellar_-_Pendimoun_during_the_6th_millennium_BCE","333687238_Influence_of_porosity_on_lipid_preservation_in_the_wall_of_archaeological_pottery","328687033_Inside_out_Assessing_pottery_forming_techniques_with_micro-CT_scanning_An_example_from_Middle_Neolithic_Thessaly","318529115_Iterative_Hough_Transform_for_Line_Detection_in_3D_Point_Clouds","312371989_Coils_slabs_and_molds_examining_community_affiliation_between_Late_Archaic_shell_ring_communities_using_radiographic_imagery_of_pottery","308600463_Combined_multi-analytical_approach_for_study_of_pore_system_in_bricks_How_much_porosity_is_there","307629706_Investigating_pottery_vessel_manufacturing_techniques_using_radiographic_imaging_and_computed_tomography_Studies_from_the_Late_Archaic_American_Southeast","300084822_Variabilite_technique_des_vases_du_Rubane_recent_du_Bassin_parisien_RRBP_et_du_Villeneuve-Saint-Germain_VSG_un_cas_d'etude_dans_la_vallee_de_l'Aisne","281047299_Enhanced_Hough_transforms_for_image_processing"]}
