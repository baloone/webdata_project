The Republic of Serbia is a small country in Europe with about seven million citizens that became an independent country in 2006. Since 2006, Serbian science has achieved some recognition. Analysis included 14,293 articles with authors all from Serbia. Distribution of published articles in the Web of Science categories, journals, scientific-research institutions and researchers were analysed. Most cited independent research articles from Serbia were also analysed. The Y-index indicator for rating the productivity of researchers and institutions was used. This indicator takes into account the contribution of the researcher to the published results. The results showed that the productivity of articles from Serbia is significant compared to neighbouring Serbian countries, taking into account the number of researchers in these countries, their GDPs and the percentages of GDPs spent on research.","authors":["Dragan Ivanovic","Yuh-Shan Ho"],"meta":["October 2014Scientometrics 101(1):603-622","DOI:10.1007/s11192-014-1396-2"],"references":["279233782_The_write_position","278724457_Observation_of_a_new_boson_at_a_mass_of_125_GeV_with_the_CMS_experiment_at_the_LHC","277313989_Observation_of_a_new_particle_in_the_search_for_the_Standard_Model_Higgs_boson_with_the_ATLAS_detector_at_the_LHC","313429397_Revised_ethical_standards_of_psychologists","311595627_Excerpts_from_Science_and_Engineering_Indicators_1998","302995075_Temsirolimus_interferon_alfa_or_both_for_advanced_renal-cell_carcinoma","296937101_Composition_operators_between_H-infinity_and_a-Bloch_spaces_on_the_polydisc","289906213_Analysis_of_scientific_productivity_in_Croatia_according_to_the_Science_Citation_Index_Social_Science_Citation_Index_and_Arts_and_Humanities_Citation_Index_for_the_1980-1995_period","284053566_H-index_An_evaluation_indicator_proposed_by_scientist","280008160_Norm_of_weighted_composition_operators_from_Bloch_space_to_H_on_the_unit_ball"]}
