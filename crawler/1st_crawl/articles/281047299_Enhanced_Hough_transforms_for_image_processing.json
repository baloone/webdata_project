{"id":"281047299_Enhanced_Hough_transforms_for_image_processing","abstract":"The thesis addresses the improvements of the Standard Hough Transform (SHT) for image processing applications. As a common tool for straight line segment detection, the Hough Transform (HT) has received extensive attention since its proposal in 1962. HT is robust since it converts the straight line detection problem to a peak seeking problem in the parameter space (also called HT space or Hough space). Feature points in the image space are mapped to the parameter space, according to the normal formulation of the possible straight lines crossing them. The cells in the digitalised parameter space obtain votes from the feature points. The local maxima, corresponding to peaks are built when corresponding cells obtain more votes than the ones around them. The peaks detected in the parameter space are then mapped back to the image space for validation. Unfortunately, when mapping feature points in the image space to the parameter space in conjunction with the voting process, rounding operations are employed, which leads to several problems of HT. The robustness, accuracy and resolution are all affected. This thesis aims to solve these problems, and the following contributions were made towards this goal : A) Because of the resolution limitation of SHT, the topics of how to select a “good” resolution, how to extend the resolutions of SHT and how to employ the super-resolution technique in HT are covered. In the research of these topics, several outputs are obtained, which are helpful to image processing applications. These include:- The map of HT performance versus resolutions is drawn, according to which “good” choices of resolutions can be found.- HT resolutions are extended by geometrical analysis of the HT butterflies.- Super resolution HT is proposed with consideration to the features of HT.- Self-similarity of the HT butterflies is discovered and employed to obtain high resolution HT with high reliability. B) For the accuracy defect of SHT, the error system of HT is studied when the image is shifted in the image space. The detection errors are employed to compensate for the defect, and an accurate HT is proposed. In order to evaluate existing HT varieties, an ideal HT is proposed as a standard","authors":["Chunling Tu"],"meta":["September 2014"],"references":["287298925_Ideal_HT_A_hough_transforms_assessment_tool","271637875_Detection_of_Dim_Maneuvering_Target_Ased_on_Randomized_Hough_Transform","257725662_Identification_of_Acoustic_Wave_Orientation_for_Ultrasound-Based_Flow_Measurement_by_Exploiting_the_Hough_Transform","257725042_Implementation_of_Hough_Transform_for_fruit_image_segmentation","256695521_Linear_volcanic_segments_in_the_central_Sunda_Arc_Indonesia_identified_using_Hough_Transform_analysis_Implications_for_arc_lithosphere_control_upon_volcano_distribution","224327859_An_improvement_of_the_Standard_Hough_Transform_to_detect_line_segments","223961070_Measuring_Straight_Line_Segments_Using_HT_Butterflies","222275232_A_Fast_Hough_Transform_for_the_Parametrisation_of_Straight_Lines_using_Fourier_Methods","5560222_Fast_Hough_transform_for_segment_detection","261729806_The_Radon_Transform_and_Some_of_Its_Applications","261127514_Good_resolutions_for_Hough_Transform","260615206_High_accuracy_Hough_transform_based_on_butterfly_symmetry","256309428_Discretization_errors_in_the_Hough_transform","247330439_Randomized_Hough_Transform_RHT_Basic_Mechanisms_Algorithms_and_Complexities","240643655_3-D_Hough_Transform_for_Surveillance_Radar_Target_Detection","237132575_Use_of_the_Hough_Transform_to_Detect_Lines_and_Curves_in_Pictures","236519005_Method_and_Means_for_Recognizing_Complex_Patterns","228090008_High_resolution_Hough_transform_based_on_butterfly_self-similarity","224586582_How_the_Hough_Transform_Was_Invented","223799864_Accurate_and_robust_line_segment_extraction_by_analyzing_distribution_around_peaks_in_Hough_space","223657235_Extended_Hough_transform_for_linear_feature_detection","223573010_Accuracy_of_the_straight_line_Hough_Transform_The_non-voting_approach","223246979_A_combinatorial_Hough_transform","223028440_A_windowing_approach_to_detecting_line_segments_using_Hough_transform","222538323_New_memory-_and_computation-efficient_hough_transform_for_detecting_lines","222520047_Accurate_and_efficient_curve_detection_in_images_The_importance_sampling_Hough_transform","222486933_Complete_line_segment_description_using_the_Hough_transform","222482307_A_new_curve_detection_method_Randomized_Hough_transform_RHT","222443096_Probabilistic_and_non-probabilistic_Hough_transforms_overview_and_comparisons","222399501_A_Hough_transform_based_line_recognition_method_utilizing_both_parameter_space_and_image_space","222396764_An_improved_Hough_transform_voting_scheme_utilizing_surround_suppression","222218489_On_high_resolution_positioning_of_straight_patters_via_multiscale_matched_filtering_of_the_Hough_transform","221662651_An_Algebraic_Approach_to_Hough_Transforms","221258575_Image_Corner_Detection_Using_Hough_Transform","220815655_Dynamically_Quantized_Spaces_for_Focusing_the_Hough_Transform","220645696_A_novel_Hough_transform_method_for_line_detection_by_enhancing_accumulator_array","220645214_Detecting_line_segments_in_an_image-_A_new_implementation_for_Hough_Transform","220644030_Error_propagation_for_the_Hough_transform","220604337_Real-time_line_detection_through_an_improved_Hough_transform_voting_scheme","220600191_A_probabilistic_Hough_transform","220566714_Picture_Processing_by_Computer","220464743_On_improving_the_accuracy_of_the_Hough_transform","220460544_A_Robust_Hough_Transform_Technique_for_Complete_Line_Segment_Description","51597638_The_Adaptive_Hough_Transform","51461220_Automatic_measurement_of_midline_shift_on_deformed_brains_using_multiresolution_binary_level_set_method_and_Hough_transform","51159496_Collinear_Segment_Detection_Using_HT_Neighborhoods","40026359_An_Improved_Hough_Transform_Neighborhood_Map_for_Straight_Line_Segments","20571385_High-resolution_image_recovery_from_image-plane_arrays_using_convex_projections","4284296_A_Nonuniform_Quantization_of_Hough_Space_for_the_Detection_of_Straight_Line_Segments","3774379_Robust_Hough_transform_technique_for_description_of_multiple_line_segments_in_an_image","3505000_Super_resolution_from_image_Sequences","3660078_On_the_discretization_of_parameter_domain_in_Hough_transformation","3514026_A_high-resolution_Hough_transform_using_variable_filter","3513631_Further_developments_on_RHT_basic_mechanisms_algorithms_andcomputational_complexities","3497897_On_improving_the_accuracy_of_the_Hough_transform_Theory_simulations_and_experiments"]}
