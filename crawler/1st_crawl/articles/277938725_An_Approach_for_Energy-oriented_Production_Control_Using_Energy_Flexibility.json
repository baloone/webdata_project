{"id":"277938725_An_Approach_for_Energy-oriented_Production_Control_Using_Energy_Flexibility","abstract":"Due to rising energy costs and growing awareness for green production, many companies expand their energy self-supply by wind or solar energy. To use this self-supply efficiently, producing companies aim to synchronize their energy demand with a limited energy supply. This has to be reflected in the companiesâ€™ production control strategies. This paper presents a concept for a short-term production control, which treats electric energy as a limited production capacity. The approach makes use of energy flexibility to align energy demand in production with energy supply while maintaining logistic goals.","authors":["Cedric Schultz","Peter Sellmaier","Gunther Reinhart"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia CIRP 29:197-202","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2015.02.038"],"references":["269890534_Realizing_Energy_Reduction_of_Machine_Tools_Through_a_Control-integrated_Consumption_Graph-based_Optimization_Method","263202232_Evaluating_Measures_for_Adapting_the_Energy_Demand_of_a_Production_System_to_Volatile_Energy_Prices","263202231_A_Model-based_Approach_to_Energy-saving_Manufacturing_Control_Strategies","316807128_Handbook_of_Manufacturing_Control","285495419_A_Petri-net_Based_Approach_for_Evaluating_Energy_Flexibility_of_Production_Machines","283756293_Energy_Efficient_and_Intelligent_Production_Scheduling_-_Evaluation_of_a_New_Production_Planning_and_Scheduling_Software","270274650_Just-For-Peak_buffer_inventory_for_peak_electricity_demand_reduction_of_manufacturing_systems","263849001_Simulationsgestutzte_Entwicklung_und_Optimierung_einer_energieeffizienten_Produktionssteuerung","261496177_Real_time_electricity_demand_response_for_sustainable_manufacturing_systems_considering_throughput_bottleneck_detection","261418821_Real_time_electricity_demand_response_for_sustainable_manufacturing_systems_Challenges_and_a_case_study"]}
