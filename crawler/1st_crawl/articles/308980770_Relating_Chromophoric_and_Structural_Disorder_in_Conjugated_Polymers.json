{"id":"308980770_Relating_Chromophoric_and_Structural_Disorder_in_Conjugated_Polymers","abstract":"The optoelectronic properties of amorphous conjugated polymers are sensitive to conformational disorder and spectroscopy provides the means for structural characterization of the fragments of the chain which interact with light - \"chromophores\". A faithful interpretation of spectroscopic conformational signatures, however, presents a key challenge. We investigate the relationship between the ground state optical gaps, the properties of the excited states, and the structural features of chromophores of a single molecule poly(3-hexyl)-thiophene (P3HT), using quantum-classical atomistic simulations. Our results demonstrate that chromophoric disorder reflects an interplay between excited state de-localization and electron-hole polarization, and is controlled by torsional disorder that is specifically associated with the presence of side chains. Within this conceptual framework, we predict and explain a counter-intuitive spectral signature of P3HT: a red-shifted absorption, despite shortening of chromophores, with increasing temperature.","authors":["Lena Simine-Nicolin","Peter J.
