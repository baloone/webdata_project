But what kind of games played by our students?\nIn this article we focus our attention on two axes common to certain school disciplines: learning of a language and citizenship learning through common rules of life. One of the specificities of the Physical Education lies in the possibility that have the teachers to build with the pupils a “form of life”, made by actions adapted to a physical practice, which is similar to a new “game of language (Wittgenstein, 2004). To develop this linguistic perspective of the Physical Education, we adopt the anthropology as the method of identification of the contents of learning. We invite the reader to perceive the difficulties of teaching in Physical Education as problems connected to the fact that the sense of our actions is socially established. “A game, a language, a rule are institutions” (Wittgenstein, 2009). This institutionalization acts at the same time as a resource and as a constraint. Indeed, this institutionalization is a sorting out what makes sense and what does not for the follower of a physical activity. The consequences for our discipline are multiple (evolution of the didactic contract, contents, evaluation) and let glimpse the possibility of cross-disciplinary learning.","authors":["Fabrice Louis"],"meta":["January 2013Staps 100(2):61","DOI:10.3917/sta.100.0061"],"references":["223422777_Family_Resemblances_Studies_in_the_Internal_Structure_of_Categories"]}
