The Jordancurve arrangement graph of A has as its vertices the intersection points of the curves in A, and two vertices are connected by an edge if their corresponding intersection points are adjacent on some curve in A. We further assume A is such that the resulting graph has no multiple edges. Under these conditions it is shown that determining whether Jordan-curve arrangement graphs are Hamiltonian is NP-complete.

The Hamiltonian circuit problem asks whether there exists at least one Ham...","authors":["Chuzo Iwamoto","Godfried T.
