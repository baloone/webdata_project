{"id":"256509329_A_research_paradigm_in_human-robot_interaction","abstract":"This paper reviews critical issues in human-robot interaction area, and proposes a research framework to study human aspects of robotic system design. The main emphasis is on system design whereby machine and human related variables interact in the context of task performance. A macro-systems approach is suggested to indicate different categories of behavior related to human and robot components. The current directions and future of research on human activities in relation to robotic systems are discussed.","authors":["Mansour Rahimi","Waldemar Karwowski"],"meta":["January 1990International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics 5(1):59â€“71","DOI:10.1016/0169-8141(90)90028-Z"],"references":["250890525_Direct_Manipulation_Interfaces","275472335_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Emergency_Stop_Buttons_on_Hand-Held_Teach_Pendants","273599041_A_Model_of_Human_Reaction_Time_to_Dangerous_Robot_Arm_Movements","269402563_On_Managing_the_Human_Factors_Engineering_of_Hybrid_Production_Systems","262355240_Task_allocation_between_humans_and_robots_in_manufacturing","262283521_Development_of_a_human_engineering_design_standard_for_robot_teach_pendants","262236023_Automation_robotization_in_particular_is_always_economically_desirable-fact_or_fiction","262219012_Human_response_to_unexpected_robot_movements_at_selected_slow_speeds","262173185_Unexpected_motion_hazard_exposures_on_a_large_robotic_assembly","258138490_Designing_the_User-Friendly_Robot_A_Case_History","257094931_The_human_side_of_factory_automation","256353204_Robotization_in_Japanese_manufacturing_industries","249955625_Perception_of_Safety_Zone_around_an_Industrial_Robot","247544041_Skills_rules_knowledge_Signals_signs_and_symbols_and_other_distinctions_in_humans_performance_mo","247542832_Skills_Rules_and_Knowledge_Signals_Signs_and_Symbols_and_Other_Distinctions_in_Human_Performance_Models","245329951_The_complexity_of_introducing_robotics_lessons_drawn_from_an_industrial_experience","245329949_The_human-robot_interface_The_role_of_artificial_intelligence","245190138_A_view_of_the_highly_automated_factory_in_the_future","243690111_Human_Errors_A_Taxonomy_for_Describing_Human_Malfunction_in_Industrial_Installations","242357555_Human_Detection_and_Diagnosis_of_System_Failures","240931076_Systems_safety_for_robots_An_energy_barrier_analysis","236492260_Robotic_Applications_and_Social_Implications","235158516_Human-Machine_Interfaces_in_Industrial_Robotics","234783038_Ten_fatal_accidents_due_to_robots_in_Japan","234782531_Post_Industrial_Manufacturing","233337958_Effective_Utilization_of_Industrial_Robots-A_Job_and_Skills_Analysis_Approach","233317680_Work_methods_measurement-a_comparison_between_robot_and_human_task_performance","230299494_Robotics_A_challenge_for_occupational_psychology","229613089_Robot_Ergonomics_Optimizing_Robot_Work","223248213_The_impact_of_electronics_and_information_technology_on_the_future_trends_and_application_of_CIM_technologies","222471766_International_comparisons_of_industrial_robot_penetration","222316370_A_Cause-and-Effect_Analysis_of_Robot_Accidents","222055456_Effects_of_Computerized_Automation_and_Robotics_on_Safety_Performance_of_a_Manufacturing_Plant","222027953_Managing_factory_automation_projects","213799949_The_Psychology_of_Human-Computer_Interaction","40960647_Information_integration_and_the_object_display_An_interaction_of_task_demands_and_display_superiority","23622768_Robots_in_modern_industry","8054730_Future_directions_and_research_issues_for_ergonomics_and_advanced_manufacturing_technology_AMT"]}
