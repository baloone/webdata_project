{"id":"255173726_A_testing_based_extraction_algorithm_for_identifying_significant_communities_in_networks","abstract":"A common and important problem arising in the study of networks is how to\ndivide the vertices of a given network into one or more groups, called\ncommunities, in such a way that vertices of the same community are more\ninterconnected than vertices belonging to different ones. We propose and\ninvestigate a testing based community detection procedure called Extraction of\nStatistically Significant Communities (ESSC). The ESSC procedure is based on\np-values for the strength of connection between a single vertex and a set of\nvertices under a reference distribution derived from a conditional\nconfiguration network model. The procedure automatically selects both the\nnumber of communities in the network, and their size. Moreover, ESSC can handle\noverlapping communities and, unlike the majority of existing methods,\nidentifies \"background\" vertices that do not belong to a well-defined\ncommunity. The method has only one parameter, which controls the stringency of\nthe hypothesis tests. We investigate the performance and potential use of ESSC,\nand compare it with a number of existing methods, through a validation study\nusing four real network datasets. In addition, we carry out a simulation study\nto assess the effectiveness of ESSC in networks with various types of community\nstructure including networks with overlapping communities and those with\nbackground vertices. These results suggest that ESSC is an effective\nexploratory tool for the discovery of relevent community structure in complex\nnetwork systems.","authors":["James D. Wilson","Simi Wang","Peter J.
