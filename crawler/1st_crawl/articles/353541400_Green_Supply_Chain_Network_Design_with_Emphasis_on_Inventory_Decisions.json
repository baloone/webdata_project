{"id":"353541400_Green_Supply_Chain_Network_Design_with_Emphasis_on_Inventory_Decisions","abstract":"Excessive greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector have led companies to move towards a sustainable supply chain network design. In this study we present a new bi-objective non-linear formulation where multiple inventory components are integrated into the location and routing decisions throughout the supply chain network. To efficiently solve the proposed model, we implement an exact method and four evolutionary algorithms for small and large-scale instances. Extensive computational results and sensitivity analysis are performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed approaches, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Besides, we run a statistical analysis to investigate whether there is any statistically significant difference between solution methods.","authors":["Meysam Mahjoob","Seyed Sajjad Fazeli","Soodabeh Milanlouei","Ali Kamali Mohammadzadeh"],"meta":["July 2021","DOI:10.1016/j.susoc.2021.07.006"],"references":["352902154_A_New_Multiobjective_Time-Cost_Trade-Off_for_Scheduling_Maintenance_Problem_in_a_Series-Parallel_System","351027126_A_Green_Multi-period_Inventory_Routing_Problem_with_Pickup_and_Split_Delivery_A_Case_Study_in_Flour_Industry","350567084_A_Location-Inventory-Routing_Model_for_Green_Supply_Chains_with_Low-Carbon_Emissions_under_Uncertainty","347777604_Integrated_Preventive_Maintenance_Scheduling_Model_with_Redundancy_for_Cutting_Tools_on_a_Single_Machine","340578007_Adaptive_variable_neighborhood_search_solution_methods_for_the_fleet_size_and_mix_pollution_location-inventory-routing_problem","336202276_Multiobjective_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Reinforcing_Equal_Population_in_Congressional_Districts","309389858_An_Evolutionary_Computation_Approach_to_Solving_Repairable_Multi-State_Multi-Objective_Redundancy_Allocation_Problems","264743332_Solving_a_new_bi-objective_location-routing-inventory_problem_in_a_distribution_network_by_meta-heuristics","263484774_Multi-products_location_routing_problem_integrated_with_inventory_under_stochastic_demand","241105578_Non-dominated_ranked_genetic_algorithm_for_solving_multi-objective_optimization_problems_NRGA","239062948_PESA-II_Region-based_selection_in_evolutionary_multiobjective_optimization","229031036_Large_scale_stochastic_inventory_routing_problems_with_split_delivery_and_service_level_constraints","224096929_A_Carbon-Capped_Supply_Chain_Network_Problem","345842539_A_hybrid_metaheuristic_algorithm_for_location_inventory_routing_problem_with_time_windows_and_fuel_consumption","339975422_Two-Stage_Stochastic_Choice_Modeling_Approach_for_Electric_Vehicle_Charging_Station_Network_Design_in_Urban_Communities","331443505_Integrated_optimization_of_location_inventory_and_routing_in_supply_chain_network_design","329007091_A_Heuristic_Method_for_Location-inventory-routing_Problem_In_A_Three-Echelon_Supply_Chain_System","308004140_A_hybrid_imperialist_competitive-simulated_annealing_algorithm_for_a_multisource_multi-product_location-routing-inventory_problem","299592427_Sustainable_design_of_a_closed-loop_location-routing-inventory_supply_chain_network_under_mixed_uncertainty","266997715_Solving_Mixed_Integer_Bilinear_Problems_Using_MILP_Formulations","258222963_Introduction_to_Quality_Engineering_Designing_Quality_into_Products_and_Processes","256937182_An_improved_version_of_the_augmented_e-constraint_method_AUGMECON2_for_finding_the_exact_pareto_set_in_multi-objective_integer_programming_problems","243766442_Errata_Use_of_Ranks_in_One-Criterion_Variance_Analysis","242931234_Further_Reduction_of_Zero-One_Polynomial_Programming_Problems_to_Zero-One_Linear_Programming_Problems","227335378_A_two-phase_heuristic_method_for_the_multi-depot_location_routing_problem_taking_inventory_control_decisions_into_consideration","225819460_A_heuristic_method_for_the_combined_location_routing_and_inventory_problem","222844669_Incorporating_location_routing_and_inventory_decisions_in_supply_chain_network_design","222420761_Incorporating_Inventory_and_Routing_Costs_in_Strategic_Location_Models","221316426_Research_into_ILRIP_for_Logistics_Distribution_Network_of_Deteriorating_Item_Based_on_JITD","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II","2386811_SPEA2_Improving_the_Strength_Pareto_Evolutionary_Algorithm"]}
