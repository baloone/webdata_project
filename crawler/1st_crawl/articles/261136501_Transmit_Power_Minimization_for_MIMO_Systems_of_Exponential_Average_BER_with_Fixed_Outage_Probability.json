{"id":"261136501_Transmit_Power_Minimization_for_MIMO_Systems_of_Exponential_Average_BER_with_Fixed_Outage_Probability","abstract":"This paper is concerned with a wireless system operating in MIMO fading\nchannels with channel state information being known at both transmitter and\nreceiver. By spatiotemporal subchannel selection and power control, it aims to\nminimize the average transmit power (ATP) of the MIMO system while achieving an\nexponential type of average bit error rate (BER) for each data stream. Under\nthe constraints of a given fixed individual outage probability (OP) and average\nBER for each subchannel, based on a traditional upper bound and a dynamic upper\nbound of Q function, two closed-form ATP expressions are derived, respectively,\nand they correspond to two different power allocation schemes. Numerical\nresults are provided to validate the theoretical analysis, and show that the\npower allocation scheme with the dynamic upper bound can achieve more power\nsavings than the one with the traditional upper bound.","authors":["Dian-Wu Yue","Yichuang Sun"],"meta":["October 2016Wireless Personal Communications 90(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-016-3432-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260670859_A_Survey_of_Energy-Efficient_Wireless_Communications","250926681_Finite-SNR_diversity-multiplexing_tradeoff_for_Rayleigh_MIMO_channels","245167358_ACHIEVING_EXPONENTIAL_DIVERSITY_ORDER_IN_RAYLEIGH_FADING_CHANNELS","268619657_Matrix_Variate_Distributions","266999288_Digital_Modulation_Techniques","266005108_Special_functions_of_mathematics_for_engineers","260655053_Reduced_Complexity_Power_Allocation_Strategies_for_MIMO_Systems_With_Singular_Value_Decomposition","246473499_Information-theoretic_and_communication-theoretic_optimal_power_allocation_for_fading_channels","243785980_Space-Time_Block_Coding_for_Wireless_Communication","243767016_Introduction_to_Space-Time_Wireless_Communications_M","224754110_Exponential_diversity_achieving_spatio-temporal_power_allocation_scheme_for_MIMO_fading_channels","236157555_Wireless_Communications_First_Edition","235671982_MIMO_wireless_communications","227660963_Capacity_of_Multi-antenna_Gaussian_Channels","224730567_Adaptive_Feedback_Communications"]}
