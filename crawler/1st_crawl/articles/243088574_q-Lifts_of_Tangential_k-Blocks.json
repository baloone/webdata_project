{"id":"243088574_q-Lifts_of_Tangential_k-Blocks","abstract":"A tangential k-block over GF (q) is a geometry representable over GF (q) with critical exponent k+1 for which every proper loopless minor has critical exponent at most k. We define what is meant by a q-lift of a matroid representable over GF(q) and show that, if M is a tangential k-block over GF(q) and M' is a q-lift of M, then M' is a tangential k + 1-block over GF(q). This enables us to extend the class of known tangential k-blocks and to answer some natural questions concerning the existence of modular hyperplanes in tangential k-blocks.","authors":["Geoff Whittle"],"meta":["February 1989Journal of the London Mathematical Society 39(1):9-15","DOI:10.1112/jlms/s2-39.1.9"],"references":["262208418_Modularity_in_tangential_k_-blocks","246860171_Modular_elements_of_geometric_lattices","243033111_Some_aspects_of_the_critical_problem_for_matroids","240927425_A_correction_to_On_the_algebraic_theory_of_graph_colorings","239061102_Modular_Constructions_for_Combinatorial_Geometries","238869715_Quotients_of_Tangential_k-Blocks","229336812_On_the_algebraic_theory_of_graph_coloring","225451491_Supersolvable_Lattices","222755592_On_Tutte's_extension_of_the_four-colour_problem","220074714_Dowling_group_geometries_and_the_critical_problem"]}
