{"id":"262324663_The_use_of_Second_Life_for_distance_education","abstract":"This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing the vaunted Second Life environment for distance education in the area of computer science. Two sets of user groups were enlisted to determine whether the virtual environment was suitable for conveying concepts ranging from the simplistic to the complex. Due to the overwhelmingly positive responses provided via the anonymous surveying of the participants, it can be determined that the Second Life platform is indeed a viable solution for distance education in the area of computer science.","authors":["Tim Ritzema","Billy Harris"],"meta":["June 2008"],"references":[]}
