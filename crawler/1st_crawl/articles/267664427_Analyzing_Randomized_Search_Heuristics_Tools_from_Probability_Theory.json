{"id":"267664427_Analyzing_Randomized_Search_Heuristics_Tools_from_Probability_Theory","abstract":"We collect a few probabilistic tools that are useful for analyzing randomized search heuristics. This includes elementary material like Markov, Chebyshev and Chernoff bounds, but also lesser known topics like dealing with sums of random variables that are only close to being independent or a strong lower bound for the time needed by the coupon collector process. Such results, while also of general interest, seem to be particularly useful in the analysis of randomized search heuristics.","authors":["Benjamin Doerr"],"meta":["February 2011","DOI:10.1142/9789814282673_0001"],"references":[]}
