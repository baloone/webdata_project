{"id":"321753750_CPSCyber_Physical_System_based_Manufacturing_System_Optimization","abstract":"Just as the Internet has revolutionized interpersonal communication and interaction, CPS is expected to bring about radical changes and revolution in the interaction between the physical and virtual worlds. CPS is called ‘realization technology’, and it creates a new reality space with innovative applications and processes, and dissolves the boundaries between real and virtual spaces. As a result, the IoT/CPS society is expected to introduce completely new and innovative applications and service providers, and bring a new paradigm shift in business and market models through new data value chains. In this idea, this study proposes new manufacturing system optimization strategy through the Cyber Physical system (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT).","authors":["SungHyun Kim","Sungbum Park"],"meta":["January 2017Procedia Computer Science 122:518-524","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.11.401"],"references":[]}
