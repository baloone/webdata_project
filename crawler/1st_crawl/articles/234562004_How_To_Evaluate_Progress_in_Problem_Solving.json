{"id":"234562004_How_To_Evaluate_Progress_in_Problem_Solving","abstract":"With the increased emphasis on teaching problem solving in mathematics has come the challenge of developing new techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of such instruction. This booklet is an attempt to provide teachers with ways to give credit for a good problem solving strategy, and yet deduct for an incorrect answer. The document provides ways to more clearly identify what is to be evaluated, outlines some evaluation techniques, discusses ways to organize and manage an evaluation program, and examines how to use the results of the evaluation. The evaluation techniques that are described include: (1) observation and questioning (addressing informal observation methods and structured interviews; (2) self-assessment data (dealing with student reports and inventories); (3) holistic scoring (including analytic scoring, focused holistic scoring, and general impression scoring); and (4) multiple-choice and completion tests. Each technique discussed includes sample problems and examples of solutions. In addition, the appendices contain some guidelines for using this booklet for in-service education, along with an annotated bibliography of additional readings about mathematical problem solving.
