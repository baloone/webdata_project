{"id":"306207413_On_the_edge_irregularity_strength_of_corona_product_of_graphs_with_paths","abstract":"For a simple graph G, a vertex labeling ϕ: V (G) → {1, 2,· ·, kg is called k-labeling. The weight of an edge xy in G, denoted by wπ (xy), is the sum of the labels of end vertices x and y, i.e. wϕ (xy) = ϕ (x) + ϕ (y). A vertex k-labeling is defined to be an edge irregular k-labeling of the graph G if for every two different edges e and f, there is wϕ (e) ≠ wϕ(f). The minimum k for which the graph G has an edge irregular k-labeling is called the edge irregularity strength of G, denoted by es(G). In this paper, we determine the exact value of edge irregularity strength of corona product of graphs with paths.","authors":["I.
