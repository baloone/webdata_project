{"id":"302525885_More_Free_Logic","abstract":"By a free logic is generally meant a variant of classical first-order logic in which constant terms may, under interpretation, fail to refer to individuals in the domain D over which the bound variables range, either because they do not refer at all or because they refer to individuals outside D. If D is identified with what is assumed by the given interpretation to exist, in accord with Quine’s dictum that “to be is to be the value of a [bound] variable,”1 then a free variation on classical semantics does not require that all constant terms refer to existents, and in this sense such terms lack existential import.","authors":["Scott Lehmann"],"meta":["January 2002","DOI:10.1007/978-94-017-0458-8_4","In book: Handbook of Philosophical Logic (pp.197-259)"],"references":["319393762_Foundations_of_Constructive_Mathematics","313706175_Free_part-whole_theory","300058281_Actualism_Free_Logic_and_First-Order_Supervaluations","288920998_Translations_from_the_Philosophical_Writings_of_Gottlob_Frege","286831449_An_Immaculate_Conception_of_Modality_or_How_to_Confuse_Use_and_Mention","273183640_Characterizing_and_Classifying","266942951_A_translation_theorem_for_two_systems_of_free_logic","266695772_On_Meyer_and_Lambert's_quantificational_calculus_FQ","266515133_Logic_and_truth_value_gaps","247674620_Supervaluations_Identity_Existence_and_Individual_Concepts","242568493_Syntactical_Treatments_of_Modality_with_Corollaries_on_Reflection_Principles_and_Finite_Axiomatizability","242457351_On_Sense_and_Reference","231875549_Free_Logic_Description_and_Virtual_Classes","226845680_Strict_Fregean_Free_Logic","226814618_Free_semantics_for_definite_descriptions","226563009_Reasoning_about_partial_functions_with_the_aid_of_a_computer","226359691_Truth_correspondence_and_non-denoting_singular_terms","226083544_Uber_Eine_Pradikatenlogik_mit_Partiell_Definierten_Pradikaten_und_Funktionen","226014167_Definedness","225263136_From_Predication_to_Programming","38382036_On_Supervaluations_in_Free_Logic","38379498_Nonstandard_Theories_of_Quantification_and_Identity","38378860_Universally_Free_Logic_and_Standard_Quantification_Theory","38355364_Objects_and_existence_Reflections_on_free_logic"]}
