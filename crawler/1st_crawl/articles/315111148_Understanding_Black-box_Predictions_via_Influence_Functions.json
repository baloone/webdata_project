{"id":"315111148_Understanding_Black-box_Predictions_via_Influence_Functions","abstract":"How can we explain the predictions of a black-box model? In this paper, we use influence functions -- a classic technique from robust statistics -- to trace a model's prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, identifying the points most responsible for a given prediction. Applying ideas from second-order optimization, we scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings and show that they can be applied to high-dimensional black-box models, even in non-convex and non-differentiable settings. We give a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for many different purposes: to understand model behavior, debug models and detect dataset errors, and even identify and exploit vulnerabilities to adversarial training-set attacks.","authors":["Pang Wei Koh","Percy Liang"],"meta":["March 2017"],"references":["313451573_Auditing_Black-Box_Models_for_Indirect_Influence","310595057_Influence_Sketching_Finding_Influential_Samples_In_Large-Scale_Regressions","307303246_Data_Poisoning_Attacks_on_Factorization-Based_Collaborative_Filtering","301897939_Not_Just_a_Black_Box_Learning_Important_Features_Through_Propagating_Activation_Differences","301857035_Second_Order_Stochastic_Optimization_in_Linear_Time","269935591_Explaining_and_Harnessing_Adversarial_Examples","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","262114048_Impact_of_HbA1c_Measurement_on_Hospital_Readmission_Rates_Analysis_of_70000_Clinical_Database_Patient_Records","261601383_Classification_in_the_Presence_of_Label_Noise_A_Survey","245032822_Model_Selection_in_Kernel_Based_Regression_using_the_Influence_Function","221650814_Spam_Filtering_with_Naive_Bayes_-_Which_Naive_Bayes","220343859_A_theory_of_learning_from_different_domains","38363785_Influential_Observations_High_Leverage_Points_and_Outliers_in_Linear_Regression","2822332_Fast_Exact_Multiplication_by_the_Hessian","322053291_Second-order_stochastic_optimization_for_machine_learning_in_linear_time","319770378_Explaining_and_harnessing_adversarial_examples","319770357_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","314731730_Residuals_and_Influence_in_Regression","313553614_Assessment_of_local_influence","311925796_Understanding_Neural_Networks_through_Representation_Erasure","309076254_Gradientbased_learning_applied_to_document_recognition","306301846_Algorithmic_Transparency_via_Quantitative_Input_Influence_Theory_and_Experiments_with_Learning_Systems","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","305999024_Why_Should_I_Trust_You_Explaining_the_Predictions_of_Any_Classifier","305342147_Why_Should_I_Trust_You_Explaining_the_Predictions_of_Any_Classifier","304548505_EU_regulations_on_algorithmic_decision-making_and_a_right_to_explanation","286205629_Efficient_approximation_of_cross-validation_for_kernel_methods_using_Bouligand_influence_function","285648386_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","283756021_On_Robustness_Properties_of_Convex_Risk_Minimization_Methods_for_Pattern_Recognition","269935358_Striving_for_Simplicity_The_All_Convolutional_Net","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262173234_Adversarial_machine_learning","261651191_Residuals_and_Influence_Regression","259399927_Deep_Inside_Convolutional_Networks_Visualising_Image_Classification_Models_and_Saliency_Maps","257409887_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","241736141_Detection_of_Influential_Observation_in_Linear_Regression","241736055_Characterizations_of_an_Empirical_Influence_Function_for_Detecting_Influential_Cases_in_Regression","241736053_Assessing_Influence_on_Predictions_From_Generalized_Linear_Models","229551127_Generalized_Leverage_and_its_Applications","228095591_Poisoning_Attacks_against_Support_Vector_Machines","226174686_On_the_Limited_Memory_BFGS_Method_for_Large_Scale_Optimization","224817353_Asymptotic_Statistics","221345102_Deep_learning_via_Hessian-free_optimization","220319959_Support_Vector_Machines_Under_Adversarial_Label_Noise","51726918_Risk_Prediction_Models_for_Hospital_Readmission_A_Systematic_Review"]}
