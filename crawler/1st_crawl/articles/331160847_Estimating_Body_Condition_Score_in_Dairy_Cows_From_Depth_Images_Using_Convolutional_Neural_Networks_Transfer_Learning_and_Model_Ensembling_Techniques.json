Periodically rating BCS of dairy cows is very important since BCS values are associated with milk production, reproduction, and health of cows. However, in practice, obtaining BCS values is a time-consuming and subjective task performed visually by expert scorers. There have been several efforts to automate BCS of dairy cows by using image analysis and machine learning techniques. In a previous work, an automatic system to estimate BCS values was proposed, which is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this paper we significantly extend the techniques exploited by that system via using transfer learning and ensemble modeling techniques to further improve BCS estimation accuracy. The improved system has achieved good estimations results in comparison with the base system. Overall accuracy of BCS estimations within 0.25 units of difference from true values has increased 4% (up to 82%), while overall accuracy within 0.50 units has increased 3% (up to 97%).","authors":["Juan Rodriguez Alvarez","Mauricio Arroqui","Pablo Mangudo","Juan Toloza"],"meta":["February 2019Agronomy 9(2)","DOI:10.3390/agronomy9020090","Project: D-TEC 005/13"],"references":["323357827_Deep_Learning_in_Agriculture_A_Survey","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","282856577_Cattle_Race_Classification_Using_Gray_Level_Co-occurrence_Matrix_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","281744029_Non-intrusive_automated_measurement_of_dairy_cow_body_condition_using_3D_video","328102307_Body_condition_estimation_on_cows_from_depth_images_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","309179092_INCORPORATING_MACHINE_VISION_IN_PRECISION_DAIRY_FARMING_TECHNOLOGIES","304106955_Development_of_automatic_body_condition_scoring_using_a_low-cost_3-dimensional_Kinect_camera","303206384_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","289627043_Neural_Predictive_Control_of_Broiler_Chicken_Growth"]}
