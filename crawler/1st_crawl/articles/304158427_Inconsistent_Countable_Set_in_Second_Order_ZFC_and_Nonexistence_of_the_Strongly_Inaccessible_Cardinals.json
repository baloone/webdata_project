{"id":"304158427_Inconsistent_Countable_Set_in_Second_Order_ZFC_and_Nonexistence_of_the_Strongly_Inaccessible_Cardinals","abstract":"We derived an important example of the inconsistent countable set in second order ZF C(ZF C2) with the full second-order semantics. Main results: (i)¬Con(ZF C2), (ii) let k be an inaccessible cardinal and H k is a set of all sets having hereditary size less then k, then ¬Con(ZF C + (V = H k)).","authors":["Jaykov Foukzon"],"meta":["July 2016","Conference: Logic Colloquium 2016 organized under the auspices of the Association for Symbolic LogicAt: Leeds (UK)"],"references":[]}
