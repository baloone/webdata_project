{"id":"236274399_Sigma-Delta_Codes","abstract":"In this paper we introduce the notion of cyclic ($f(t),\\sigma,\\delta$)-codes\nfor $f(t)\\in \\Ore$. These codes generalize the $\\theta$-codes as introduced by\nD. Boucher, F. Ulmer, W. Geiselmann \\cite{BGU}. We construct generic and\ncontrol matrices for these codes. As a particular case the ($\\si,\\de$)-$W$-code\nassociated to a Wedderburn polynomial are defined and we show that their\ncontrol matrices are given by generalized Vandermonde matrices. All the\nWedderburn polynomials of $\\mathbb F_q[t;\\theta]$ are described and their\ncontrol matrices are presented. A key role will be played by the pseudo-linear\ntransformations.","authors":["Boulagouaz M Hammed","Andr√© Leroy"],"meta":["April 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268068052_Codes_over_rings_Proceedings_of_the_CIMPA_summer_school_Ankara_Turkey_August_18-29_2008","265024268_Skew_Constacyclic_Codes_over_Galois_Rings","257554963_Linear_codes_using_skew_polynomials_with_automorphisms_and_derivations","233944833_Noncommutative_Symmetric_functions_and_W_-polynomials","230609710_Noncommutative_polynomial_maps","257481710_Binary_quasi-cyclic_codes_of_index_2_and_skew_polynomial_rings","256796007_Convolutional_codes_with_additional_algebraic_structure","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","228343378_Code_equivalence_characterizes_finite_Frobenius_rings","222413229_Wedderburn_polynomials_over_division_rings_I"]}
