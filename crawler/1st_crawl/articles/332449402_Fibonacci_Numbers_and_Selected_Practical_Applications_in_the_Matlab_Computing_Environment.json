{"id":"332449402_Fibonacci_Numbers_and_Selected_Practical_Applications_in_the_Matlab_Computing_Environment","abstract":"Fibonacci numbers play an important role in mathematics and appear in many places to solve practical problems even. In fact, many complex publications have been published on this issue. Surprisingly, Fibonacci numbers are used so extensively that an association dealing with issues related to them was established. Since 1963, it has issued a specialized scientific journal called Fibonacci Quarterly. The most well-known applications that take advantage of Fibonacci numbers are in geometry, but when exploring their contexts and methods, the use of Fibonacci numbers in computer science and in school mathematics has also been addressed.","authors":["Viliam Ďuriš","Lucia Rumanová","Dusan Vallo","Júlia Záhorská"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.17846/AMN.2019.5.1.14-22"],"references":["330740074_The_Fibonacci_Numbers_and_Its_Amazing_Applications","222889168_Golden_ratio_in_science_as_random_sequence_source_its_computation_and_beyond"]}
