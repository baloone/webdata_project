{"id":"340356568_A_review_paper_on_artificial_intelligence_at_the_service_of_human_resources_management","abstract":"span>In the last few years, all companies have been interested in the analysis of data related to Human Resources and have focused on human capital, which is considered as the major factor influencing the companyâ€™s development and all its activities at all levels of human resource policies. Data analysis (HR analytics) will significantly improve business profitability over the next years.We started with an extensive survey of different human resources problems and risks reported by HR specialists, then a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on computer science techniques proposed to solve these problems and finally focusing on suggested artificial intelligence methods. This review article will be an archive and a reference for computer scientists working on HR by summarizing the IT solutions already made in human resources for the period between 2008 and 2018. It aims to present clearly the issues that HR researchers face and for which computer scientists seek solutions. It summarizes at the same time the recent and different methods, IT approaches and tools already used by highlighting those using artificial intelligence.</span","authors":["Siham Berhil","EL Habib Benlahmar","Nasser Labani"],"meta":["April 2020Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 18(1):32","DOI:10.11591/ijeecs.v18.i1.pp32-40"],"references":["332140232_Jobseeker-industry_matching_system_using_automated_keyword_selection_and_visualization_approach","331148444_Prediction_of_overcurrent_rRelay_miscoordination_time_using_artificial_neural_network","330997856_AI-based_targeted_advertising_system","326537577_Assessment_of_prioritizing_the_effective_factors_on_human_resources_effectiveness_Case_Study_Tehran_Industrial_Parks_Organization","326089955_PERSONNEL_SELECTION_FOR_PROMOTION_USING_AN_INTEGRATED_FUZZY_ANALYTIC_HIERARCHY_PROCESS-GREY_RELATIONAL_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY_A_REAL_CASE_STUDY","324998528_The_Impact_of_Human_Resource_Management_Practices_on_Perceptions_of_Organizational_Performance","332170240_Some_Insights_into_Procedures_and_Practices_to_Acquire_the_Right_Talent_Journal_of_Strategic_Human_Resource_Management_Volume_6_Issue_2","325422316_Evaluation_of_machine_learning_models_for_employee_churn_prediction","325279409_System_dynamics-based_approach_to_manpower_planning_A_study_of_Indian_microfinance_institutions","324470595_Classifying_online_Job_Advertisements_through_Machine_Learning"]}
