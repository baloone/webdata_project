{"id":"337300141_Software_Fault_Prediction_Using_Deep_Learning_Algorithms","abstract":"Software faults prediction (SFP) processes can be used for detecting faulty constructs at early stages of the development lifecycle, in addition to its being used in several phases of the development process. Machine learning (ML) is widely used in this area. One of the most promising subsets from ML is deep learning that achieves remarkable performance in various areas. Two deep learning algorithms are used in this paper, the Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In order to evaluate the studied algorithms, four commonly used datasets from NASA are used i.e. (PC1, KC1, KC2 and CM1). The experiment results show how the CNN algorithm achieves prediction superiority of the MLP algorithm. The accuracy and detection rate measurements when using CNN has reached the standard ratio respectively as follows: PC1 97.7% - 73.9%, KC1 100% - 100%, KC2 99.3% - 99.2% and CM1 97.3% - 82.3%. This study provides promising results in using the deep learning for software fault prediction research.","authors":["Osama Alqasem","Mohammed Akour"],"meta":["October 2019International Journal of Open Source Software and Processes 10(4):1-19","DOI:10.4018/IJOSSP.2019100101"],"references":["317072561_Modulation_classification_using_convolutional_Neural_Network_based_deep_learning_model","336559930_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_for_Bearing_Fault_Diagnostics_-_A_Review","326029031_Deep_learning_and_its_applications_to_machine_health_monitoring","321660736_Pre-training_of_an_artificial_neural_network_for_software_fault_prediction","321469279_Software_Defect_Prediction_Using_Stacked_Denoising_Autoencoders_and_Two-stage_Ensemble_Learning","318288252_A_Hybrid_Approach_for_Software_Fault_Prediction_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network_and_Simplified_Swarm_Optimization","318035736_An_ensemble_classification_algorithm_for_convolutional_neural_network_based_on_AdaBoost","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","308853938_Deep_Learning_for_Just-in-Time_Defect_Prediction","305305074_A_review_on_advances_in_deep_learning"]}
