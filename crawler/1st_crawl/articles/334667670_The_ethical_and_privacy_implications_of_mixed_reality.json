{"id":"334667670_The_ethical_and_privacy_implications_of_mixed_reality","abstract":"The spatial computing affordances of virtual and augmented reality introduce new ethical and privacy dilemmas. This panel will explore the many implications of biometric data (eye tracking, facial tracking, gait detection, emotional sentiment analysis, galvanic skin response, EEG, EMG, and ECG) to contextually-aware computing that can scan and identify your immediate surroundings. There are many unknown ethical thresholds with immersive computing, and this panel will discuss our own moral intuitions on the topic while inviting the audience to share their own questions and insights for how to navigate this landscape.","authors":["Kent Bye","Diane Hosfelt","Sam Chase","Matt Miesnieks"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3306212.3328138","Conference: ACM SIGGRAPH 2019 Panels"],"references":["329648152_Differentiation_of_mild_cognitive_impairment_using_an_entorhinal_cortex-based_test_of_VR_navigation","260842925_Increasing_Saving_Behavior_Through_Age-Progressed_Renderings_of_the_Future_Self","11379304_Measuring_Sexual_Preferences_in_Virtual_Reality_A_Pilot_Study","326856533_Protecting_Nonverbal_Data_Tracked_in_Virtual_Reality","325831377_You_can_do_that_Feasibility_of_virtual_reality_exposure_therapy_in_the_treatment_of_PTSD_due_to_military_sexual_trauma","318127839_Potential_Of_Virtual_Reality_As_A_Diagnostic_Tool_For_Social_Anxiety_A_Pilot_Study","262841944_Leaderboards_in_a_virtual_classroom_A_test_of_stereotype_threat_and_social_comparison_explanations_for_women's_math_performance","257252937_The_embodiment_of_sexualized_virtual_selves_The_Proteus_effect_and_experiences_of_self-objectification_via_avatars"]}
