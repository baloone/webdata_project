{"id":"316216511_The_combined_finite-discrete_element_method","abstract":"The combined finite discrete element method is a relatively new computational tool aimed at problems involving static and / or dynamic behaviour of systems involving a large number of solid deformable bodies. Such problems include fragmentation using explosives (e.g rock blasting), impacts, demolition (collapsing buildings), blast loads, digging and loading processes, and powder technology. The combined finite-discrete element method - a natural extension of both discrete and finite element methods - allows researchers to model problems involving the deformability of either one solid body, a large number of bodies, or a solid body which fragments (e.g. in rock blasting applications a more or less intact rock mass is transformed into a pile of solid rock fragments of different sizes, which interact with each other). The topic is gaining in importance, and is at the forefront of some of the current efforts in computational modeling of the failure of solids. * Accompanying source codes plus input and output files available on the Internet * Important applications such as mining engineering, rock blasting and petroleum engineering * Includes practical examples of applications areas Essential reading for postgraduates, researchers and software engineers working in mechanical engineering.","authors":["Ante Munjiza"],"meta":["December 2004","DOI:10.1002/0470020180","ISBN: 9780470841990"],"references":["231844941_Boundary_interactions_for_two-dimensional_granular_flows_Part_1_Flat_boundaries_asymmetric_stresses_and_couple_stresses","311344190_Applications_of_theoretical_contact_mechanics_to_solid_particle_system_simulation","285460628_A_contribution_to_the_mechanics_of_heterogeneous_granular_media","270426290_ONE_EXAMPLE_OF_TWO_DIMENSIONAL_RANDOM_PACKING_OF_SAND_PARTICLES","246822692_Micromechanical_Modelling_of_Constitutive_Relations_for_Granular_Material"]}
