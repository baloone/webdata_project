{"id":"336915761_APPLICATIONS_OF_GRAPH_THEORY_IN_HUMAN_LIFE","abstract":"The author presents some graph theoretical planning techniques which have been employed in the design of a GSM (Group Special Mobile) operated by the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited. Apart from a new variant of the by now classical application of graph coloring to frequency assignment, these techniques deal with the determination of the base station identity code (BSIC), hopping sequence number (HSN), and location area code (LAC). It is shown that GSM radio network planning involves a number of optimization problems and Time Table Scheduling Problems which can be treated by graph theoretical methods.","authors":["Salaka Venu Madhava Sarma"],"meta":["January 2012"],"references":["228627540_Graph-Based_and_Structural_Methods_for_Fingerprint_Classification","3193287_Introduction_to_the_special_section_on_graph_algorithms_in_computer_vision","321009812_GRAPH_THEORY_WITH_APPLICATIONS_TO_ENGINEERING_AND_COMPUTER_SCIENCE","3046711_A_Graph_Model_for_Fault-Tolerant_Computing"]}
