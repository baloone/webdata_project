{"id":"226669509_A_new_method_for_computing_polynomial_greates_common_divisors_and_polynomial_remainder_sequences","abstract":"A new method is presented for the computation of a greatest common divisor (gcd) of two polynomials, along with their polynomial remainder sequence (prs). This method is based on our generalization of a theorem by Van Vleck [12] and uniformly treats both normal and abnormal prs's, making use of Bareiss's [3] integer-preserving transformation algorithm for Gaussian elimination. Moreover, for the polynomials of the prs's, this method provides the smallest coefficients that can be expected without coefficient ged computations (as in Bareiss [3]) and it clearly demonstrates the divisibility properties; hence, it combines the best of both the reduced and the subresultant prs algorithms.","authors":["Alkiviadis G.
