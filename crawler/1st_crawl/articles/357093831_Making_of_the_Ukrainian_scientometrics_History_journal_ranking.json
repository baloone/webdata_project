{"id":"357093831_Making_of_the_Ukrainian_scientometrics_History_journal_ranking","abstract":"History as an Academic Subject is in crisis of a traditional paradigm, information technologies have transformed the world into the phenomenon of information society. The article is devoted to the problem of creating a specialized database of Ukrainian scientific journals (History studies). Author moderately criticizes the traditional methods of scientometrics. Generally, journal impact factor (Clarivate Analytics) and CiteScore (Elsevier). The specifics of inapplicability are based on main problem which flows to the fact that citation on the history of Ukraine (and number of local history problems) will be deliberately so low since it is less interesting for the scientific community of other countries. Since the creation of any Bibliometrics is based on the collection and addition of materials to the database, the main attention is focused on the definition of Content management systems for their further integration into History journal ranking frame. Our purpose is to define of CMS types and further writing of the corresponding software significantly optimizes the work of operators. For determination of CMS we analyze the HTML code of the web-pages. It is paid attention to consider the place of historical disciplines in the system of Ukrainian science according to Register of scientific journals of Ukraine.","authors":["A.L. Pilkevych","V.O.
