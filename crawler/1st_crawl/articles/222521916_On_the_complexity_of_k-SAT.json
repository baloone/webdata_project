{"id":"222521916_On_the_complexity_of_k-SAT","abstract":"The k-SAT problem is to determine if a given k-CNF has a satisfying assignment. It is a celebrated open question as to whether it requires exponential time to solve k-SAT for k⩾3. Here exponential time means 2δn for some δ>0. In this paper, assuming that, for k⩾3, k-SAT requires exponential time complexity, we show that the complexity of k-SAT increases as k increases. More precisely, for k⩾3, define sk=inf{δ: there exists 2δn algorithm for solving k-SAT}. Define ETH (Exponential-Time Hypothesis) for k-SAT as follows: for k⩾3, sk>0. In this paper, we show that sk is increasing infinitely often assuming ETH for k-SAT. Let s∞ be the limit of sk. We will in fact show that sk⩽(1−d/k) s∞ for some constant d>0. We prove this result by bringing together the ideas of critical clauses and the Sparsification Lemma to reduce the satisfiability of a k-CNF to the satisfiability of a disjunction of 2εnk′-CNFs in fewer variables for some k′⩾k and arbitrarily small ε>0. We also show that such a disjunction can be computed in time 2εn for arbitrarily small ε>0.","authors":["Russell Impagliazzo","Ramamohan Paturi"],"meta":["January 1999Journal of Computer and System Sciences 62(2):367-375","DOI:10.1006/jcss.2000.1727","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["222871662_Solving_satisfiability_in_less_than_2n_steps","3785061_An_Improved_Exponential-Time_Algorithm_for_k-SAT","279540844_O20_3_0_4_N_ALGORITHM_FOR_SOLVING_MAXIMUM_INDEPENDENT_SET_PROBLEM","266728712_3-coloring_in_time_O13446_n_A_no-MIS_algorithm","256181513_A_note_on_the_complexity_of_the_chromatic_number_problem","248307703_Various_upper_bounds_on_the_complexity_of_algorithms_for_deciding_propositional_tautolo-gies","229646573_A_Simple_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Clique_and_Its_Worst-Case_Time_Complexity","227308689_Solving_3-satisfiability_in_less_than_1_579n_steps","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222614617_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Sets","222497307_Experimental_results_on_the_crossover_point_in_random_3-SAT","221499473_A_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_k-SAT_and_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","220618427_Finding_a_Maximum_Independent_Set","3728325_Satisfiability_Coding_Lemma","3635326_3-coloring_in_time_013446_A_no-MIS_algorithm","3048810_An_O20304n_Algorithm_for_Solving_Maximum_Independent_Set_Problem","2658511_Two_new_upper_bounds_for_SAT","2643869_3-Coloring_in_time_O13446n_a_no-MIS_algorithm","2513075_Deciding_propositional_tautologies_Algorithms_and_their_complexity","2295775_Pure_Literal_Look_Ahead_An_O1497n_Satisfiability_Algorithm_Extended_Abstract"]}
