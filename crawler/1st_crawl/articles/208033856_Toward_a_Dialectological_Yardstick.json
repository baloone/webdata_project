{"id":"208033856_Toward_a_Dialectological_Yardstick","abstract":"Abstract Dialectometry measures the dierences,between dialects in ways which may involve many independently varying parameters which must be specied,in combination in order to arrive at measures of dierence.,The existence of many,parameters of measurement,and possible interaction introduces the problem of how to choose parameter values and combinations of them intelligently. This paper proceeds from the assumption that dialectology proper must reveal geographic coherence in language variation in order to propose a yardstick with which to compare measurements made using various parameter settings, and it presents some results of its application.","authors":["John Nerbonne","Peter Kleiweg"],"meta":["August 2007Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 14(2-3):148-166","DOI:10.1080/09296170701379260"],"references":["345802704_American_Regional_Dialects_A_Word_Geography","341632676_Dialectology_and_Linguistic_Diffusion","336833561_A_Distinctive_Feature_Based_System_for_the_Evaluation_of_Segmental_Transcription_in_Dutch","292283243_La_relation_entre_la_distance_spatiale_et_la_distance_lexicale","275874821_Language_Distribution_and_Migration_Theory","255578814_NORWEGIAN_DIALECT_DISTANCES_GEOGRAPHICALLY_EXPLAINED1","245272566_American_Regional_Dialects_A_Word_Geography","243774936_Phonetic_transcription_a_methodological_and_empirical_study","242637644_An_Algorithm_for_Suffix_Stripping","242420381_A_Method_for_Comparing_Two_Hierachical_Clusterings"]}
