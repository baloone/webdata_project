{"id":"344028237_Controversies_in_artificial_intelligence","abstract":"Purpose of review: \nTo review four recent controversial topics arising from deep learning applications in ophthalmology.\n\nRecent findings: \nThe controversies of four recent topics surrounding deep learning applications in ophthalmology are discussed, including the following: lack of explainability, limited generalizability, potential biases and protection of patient confidentiality in large-scale data transfer.\n\nSummary: \nThese controversial issues spanning the domains of clinical medicine, public health, computer science, ethics and legal issues, are complex and likely will benefit from an interdisciplinary approach if artificial intelligence in ophthalmology is to succeed over the next decade.","authors":["Tin Yan Alvin Liu","Neil M.
