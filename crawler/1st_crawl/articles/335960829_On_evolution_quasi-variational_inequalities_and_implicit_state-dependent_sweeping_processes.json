{"id":"335960829_On_evolution_quasi-variational_inequalities_and_implicit_state-dependent_sweeping_processes","abstract":"In this paper, we study a variant of the state-dependent sweeping process with velocity constraint. The constraint \nC\n(\n⋅\n,\nu\n)\nC(⋅,u) depends upon the unknown state \nu\nu, which causes one of the main difficulties in the mathematical treatment of quasi-variational inequalities. Our aim is to show how a fixed point approach can lead to an existence theorem for this implicit differential inclusion. By using Schauder's fixed point theorem combined with a recent existence and uniqueness theorem in the case where the moving set \nC\nC does not depend explicitly on the state \nu\nu (i.e. \nC\n:=\nC\n(\nt\n)\nC:=C(t)) given in [4], we prove a new existence result of solutions of the quasi-variational sweeping process in the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces with a velocity constraint. Contrary to the classical state-dependent sweeping process, no conditions on the size of the Lipschitz constant of the moving set, with respect to the state, is required.","authors":["Samir Adly","Tahar Haddad"],"meta":["September 2019Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems - Series S","DOI:10.3934/dcdss.2020105","Project: Sweeping processes"],"references":["325080202_An_Implicit_Sweeping_Process_Approach_to_Quasistatic_Evolution_Variational_Inequalities","316638568_On_semicoercive_sweeping_process_with_velocity_constraint","271213864_Convex_sweeping_process_in_the_framework_of_measure_differential_inclusions_and_evolution_variational_inequalities","222080828_A_method_using_the_approach_of_Moreau_and_Panagiotopoulos_for_the_mathematical_formulation_of_non-regular_circuits_in_electronics","321744203_Evolution_problem_associated_with_a_moving_convex_set_in_a_Hilbert_space","246970347_Nonlinear_Functional_Analysis_and_Applications_I_Fixed-Point_The-orems","245925471_Differential_Inclusions_in_Nonsmooth_Mechanical_Problems_Shocks_and_Dry_Friction","243007285_An_existence_theorem_for_a_class_of_differential_equations_with_multivalued_right-hand_side","228977431_On_parabolic_quasi-variational_inequalities_and_state-dependent_sweeping_processes","228825010_Numerical_aspect_of_sweeping_process","224010939_A_mathematical_framework_for_a_crowd_motion_model","47363551_Nonsmooth_Modeling_and_Simulation_for_Switched_Circuits"]}
