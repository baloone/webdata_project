{"id":"11769019_Image_restoration_using_the_Q-Ising_spin_glass","abstract":"We investigate static and dynamic properties of gray-scale image restoration (GSIR) by making use of the Q-Ising spin glass model, whose ladder symmetry allows to take in account the distance between two spins. We thus give an explicit expression of the Hamming distance between the original and restored images as a function of the hyper-parameters in the mean field limit. Finally, numerical simulations for real-world pictures are carried out to prove the efficiency of our model. PACS numbers: 02.50.-r, 05.20.-y, 05.50.-q In the last decade, the problem of the image restoration (IR) has been successfully investigated by means of techniques borrowed from the field of statistical mechanics. Among them, it is certainly worthy mentioning the Maximum Posterior Marginal (MPM) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimations.
