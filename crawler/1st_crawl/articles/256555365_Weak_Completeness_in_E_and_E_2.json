{"id":"256555365_Weak_Completeness_in_E_and_E_2","abstract":"The notions of weak P m -completeness for the complexity classes E = DTIME(2 linear ) and E 2 = DTIME(2 polynomial ) are compared. An element C of one of these classes is weakly P m - complete for the class if the set Pm (C), consisting of all languages A P m C, does not have measure 0 in the class. The following two results are proven. (i) Every problem that is weakly P m -complete for E is weakly P m -complete for E 2 . (ii) There is a problem in E that is weakly P m -complete for E 2 , but not for E. 1 Introduction The completeness phenomenon is, to date, our principal tool for ascertaining the complexities of seemingly intractable computational problems. Problems that are complete for NP, PSPACE, or classes in between are presumably intractable because we are inclined to believe that P 6= NP. Problems that are complete for exponential time are provably intractable by the time hierarchy theorem of Hartmanis and Stearns [3]. In fact, such problems are now known to ha...","authors":["David Juedes","Jack H.
