{"id":"265990523_From_Regular_Tree_Expression_to_Position_Tree_Automaton","abstract":"The word position automaton was introduced by Glushkov and McNaughton in the early 1960. This automaton is homogeneous and has (∥E∥+1) states for an expression of alphabetic width ∥E∥. In this paper this type of automata is extended to regular tree expressions and it is shown that the conversion of a regular tree expression of size |E| and alphabetic width ∥E∥ into its reduced tree automaton can be done in O(|E|·∥E∥) time. The time complexity of the algorithm proposed by Dietrich Kuske and Ingmar Meinecke is also proved in order to reach an O(∥E∥·|E|) time complexity for the problem of the construction of the equation automaton from a regular tree expression.","authors":["Éric Laugerotte","Nadia Ouali Sebti","Djelloul Ziadi"],"meta":["April 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-37064-9_35","Conference: International Conference on Language and Automata Theory and Applications"],"references":["220320851_Rational_Kernels_Theory_and_Algorithms","220165910_Efficient_weighted_expressions_conversion","220165346_Construction_of_tree_automata_from_regular_expressions","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","222734141_Partial_derivatives_of_regular_expressions_and_finite_automaton_constructions","221313897_From_regular_expressions_to_DFA's_using_compressed_NFA's","220980282_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","29655265_Passage_d'une_expression_rationnelle_a_un_automate_fini_non-deterministe","3656828_Origins_and_metamorphoses_of_the_Trinity_logic_nets_automata","2354986_From_Regular_Expressions_to_DFA's_Using_Compressed_NFA's"]}
