{"id":"313857891_A_Survey_on_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Image_Analysis","abstract":"Deep learning algorithms, in particular convolutional networks, have rapidly become a methodology of choice for analyzing medical images. This paper reviews the major deep learning concepts pertinent to medical image analysis and summarizes over 300 contributions to the field, most of which appeared in the last year. We survey the use of deep learning for image classification, object detection, segmentation, registration, and other tasks and provide concise overviews of studies per application area. Open challenges and directions for future research are discussed.","authors":["Geert Litjens","Thijs Kooi","Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi","Arnaud Arindra Adiyoso Setio"],"meta":["February 2017Medical Image Analysis 42","DOI:10.1016/j.media.2017.07.005"],"references":["319600380_Corrigendum_Towards_automatic_pulmonary_nodule_management_in_lung_cancer_screening_with_deep_learning","317725063_Deep_learning-based_assessment_of_tumor-associated_stroma_for_diagnosing_breast_cancer_in_histopathology_images","316283273_Understanding_the_Mechanisms_of_Deep_Transfer_Learning_for_Medical_Images","313212493_Spatial_Aggregation_of_Holistically-Nested_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Automated_Pancreas_Localization_and_Segmentation","319770414_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","319770411_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770174_Practical_recommendations_for_gradient-based_training_of_deep_architectures","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","318854264_Ensemble_of_Expert_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Spatio-Temporal_Denoising_of_Contrast-Enhanced_MRI_Sequences"]}
