{"id":"348198392_MetaNetXMNXref_unified_namespace_for_metabolites_and_biochemical_reactions_in_the_context_of_metabolic_models","abstract":"MetaNetX/MNXref is a reconciliation of metabolites and biochemical reactions providing cross-links between major public biochemistry and Genome-Scale Metabolic Network (GSMN) databases. The new release brings several improvements with respect to the quality of the reconciliation, with particular attention dedicated to preserving the intrinsic properties of GSMN models. The MetaNetX website (https://www.metanetx.org/) provides access to the full database and online services. A major improvement is for mapping of user-provided GSMNs to MXNref, which now provides diagnostic messages about model content. In addition to the website and flat files, the resource can now be accessed through a SPARQL endpoint (https://rdf.metanetx.org).","authors":["Sébastien Moretti","Van Du T Tran","Florence Mehl","Mark Ibberson"],"meta":["January 2021Nucleic Acids Research 49(D1):D570-D574","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkaa992"],"references":["343900659_Community_standards_to_facilitate_development_and_address_challenges_in_metabolic_modeling","343897506_SBML_Level_3_an_extensible_format_for_the_exchange_and_reuse_of_biological_models","343316007_Systems_Biology_Approaches_to_Understanding_the_Human_Immune_System","341574776_A_biochemically-interpretable_machine_learning_classifier_for_microbial_GWAS","339635928_MEMOTE_for_standardized_genome-scale_metabolic_model_testing","337101704_The_reactome_pathway_knowledgebase","337101645_BiGG_Models_2020_Multi-strain_genome-scale_models_and_expansion_across_the_phylogenetic_tree","333763268_Current_status_and_applications_of_genome-scale_metabolic_models","330509488_UniProt_a_worldwide_hub_of_protein_knowledge","330334757_SLIMEr_Probing_flexibility_of_lipid_metabolism_in_yeast_with_an_improved_constraint-based_modeling_framework"]}
