{"id":"335038223_Open_Vocabulary_Arabic_Diacritics_Restoration","abstract":"Diacritics restoration is a necessary component in order to develop Arabic text to speech systems. When diacritics are present, the phonetic transcription algorithm can be implemented based on a few rules. Restoring Arabic diacritics based on language model scoring is the dominant approach. A fixed vocabulary is usually used to build the language model used for scoring. Since Arabic is a morphologically rich language, the number of the Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words is large and the diacritization algorithm fails to restore diacritics for these words. In this paper, we present a novel approach to support open vocabulary diacritics restoration based on the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) method. The BPE method segments the words into variable length sub-word units and allows open vocabulary from fixed sub-word units dictionary. On the Tashkeela diacritization task, this open vocabulary approach outperforms the word and character based methods commonly used in the literature.","authors":["Yasser Hifny"],"meta":["August 2019Signal Processing Letters, IEEE PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LSP.2019.2933721"],"references":["326163674_Diacritizing_Arabic_Text_Using_a_Single_Hidden_Markov_Model","318738613_Arabic_Diacritization_Stats_Rules_and_Hacks","318738608_SHAKKIL_An_Automatic_Diacritization_System_for_Modern_Standard_Arabic_Texts","313358210_Tashkeela_Novel_corpus_of_Arabic_vocalized_texts_data_for_auto-diacritization_systems","312671188_Automatic_Diacritics_Restoration_for_Dialectal_Arabic_Text","308672285_Automatic_diacritics_restoration_for_modern_standard_arabic_text","301446042_Arabic_Diacritization_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","281427452_Neural_Machine_Translation_of_Rare_Words_with_Subword_Units","277021918_A_Hybrid_Approach_for_Arabic_Diacritization","273918305_Automatic_diacritization_of_Arabic_text_using_recurrent_neural_networks","266798715_Hybrid_Approaches_For_Automatic_Vowelization_of_Arabic_Texts","259453069_A_survey_of_automatic_Arabic_diacritization_techniques","237050987_Diacritics_Restoration_for_Arabic_Dialects","234798866_An_HMM_approach_to_vowel_restoration_in_Arabic_and_Hebrew","233735067_A_Hybrid_Approach_for_Building_Arabic_Diacritizer","220816874_Arabic_Diacritization_through_Full_Morphological_Tagging","327000565_Hybrid_LSTMMaxEnt_Networks_for_Arabic_Syntactic_Diacritics_Restoration","322516492_Investigating_hybrid_approaches_for_Arabic_text_diacritization_with_recurrent_neural_networks","318741532_A_Layered_Language_Model_based_Hybrid_Approach_to_Automatic_Full_Diacritization_of_Arabic","307174896_An_Empirical_Study_of_Smoothing_Techniques_for_Language_Modeling","306093632_Neural_Machine_Translation_of_Rare_Words_with_Subword_Units","305880532_A_multi-layered_approach_for_Arabic_text_diacritization","282987495_Restoration_of_Arabic_Diacritics_Using_a_Multilevel_Statistical_Model","271643271_Deep_Learning_Framework_with_Confused_Sub-Set_Resolution_Architecture_for_Automatic_Arabic_Diacritization","266055670_Smoothing_Techniques_for_Arabic_Diacritics_Restoration","261861145_A_new_algorithm_for_data_compression","261037881_Restoration_of_Arabic_diacritics_using_dynamic_programming","255687082_ARABTALK_An_implementation_for_arabic_text_to_speech_system","224123580_A_Stochastic_Arabic_Diacritizer_Based_on_a_Hybrid_of_Factorized_and_Unfactorized_Textual_Features","224102263_An_Arabic_morphological_system","222835593_A_Bit_of_Progress_in_Language_Modeling","220875255_An_Empirical_Study_of_Smoothing_Techniques_for_Language_Modeling","220873450_Maximum_Entropy_Based_Restoration_of_Arabic_Diacritics","38412697_Arabic_diacritization_using_weighted_finite-state_transducers","3081191_Error_Bounds_for_Convolutional_Codes_and_an_Asymptotically_Optimum_Decoding_Algorithm","2602251_Srilm_---_An_Extensible_Language_Modeling_Toolkit"]}
