{"id":"277334392_On_Nested_Sequents_for_Constructive_Modal_Logics","abstract":"We present deductive systems for various modal logics that can be obtained\nfrom the constructive variant of the normal modal logic CK by adding\ncombinations of the axioms d, t, b, 4, and 5. This includes the constructive\nvariants of the standard modal logics K4, S4, and S5. We use for our\npresentation the formalism of nested sequents and give a syntactic proof of cut\nelimination.","authors":["Ryuta Arisaka","Anupam Das","Lutz Stra√üburger"],"meta":["May 2015Logical Methods in Computer Science 11(3)","DOI:10.2168/LMCS-11(3:7)2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267111975_Nested_Sequents_for_Intuitionistic_Logics","244456515_Constructive_CK_for_Contexts","226515897_On_An_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logic","50853889_Label-free_Natural_Deduction_Systems_for_Intuitionistic_and_Classical_Modal_Logics","4350440_From_Axioms_to_Analytic_Rules_in_Nonclassical_Logics","2645922_Logical_Modalities_and_Multi-Stage_Programming","2570102_Categorical_and_Kripke_Semantics_for_Constructive_S4_Modal_Logic","284534533_Intuitionistic_modal_logic_with_quantifiers","281886444_Label-free_Modular_Systems_for_Classical_and_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logics","281162586_An_introduction_to_proof_theory","261961346_On_the_Computational_Interpretation_of_CKn_for_Contextual_Information_Processing","243767800_The_Proof_Theory_and_Semantics_of_Intu-itionistic_Modal_Logic","243713232_Axiomatizations_for_some_intuitionistic_modal_logics","241855244_Basic_Proof_Theory","238809484_Sequent_Caluli_for_Normal_Modal_Propositional_Logics","229342296_An_Introduction_to_Proof_Theory","226570137_Deep_Sequent_Systems_for_Modal_Logic","223780325_Constructive_modal_logics_I","222331698_2-Sequent_calculus_a_proof_theory_of_modalities","222314372_Propositional_Lax_Logic","221551219_A_Framework_for_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logics","221342820_Taming_Displayed_Tense_Logics_Using_Nested_Sequents_with_Deep_Inference","220394720_Prefixed_Tableaus_and_Nested_Sequents","220388126_2-Sequent_Calculus_Intuitionism_and_Natural_Deduction","220298004_Cut-Free_Sequent_Calculi_for_Some_Tense_Logics","220248469_Cut-free_Gentzen_Calculus_for_Multimodal_CK","36138485_Natural_Deduction_A_Proof-Theoretical_Study","2926806_The_Undecidability_of_k-Provability","2899211_A_Modal_Analysis_of_Staged_Computation","2520348_A_Judgmental_Reconstruction_of_Modal_Logic","2240390_A_Modal_Analysis_of_Staged_Computation"]}
