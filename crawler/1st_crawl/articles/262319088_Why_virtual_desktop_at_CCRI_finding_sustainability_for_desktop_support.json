{"id":"262319088_Why_virtual_desktop_at_CCRI_finding_sustainability_for_desktop_support","abstract":"There is an ever-increasing demand being placed on desktop resources to get the desktop replacement cycle and imaging of computers complete for the start of classes. Time is constantly being whittled from the larger windows of opportunity that used to exist. So now there is a need to be more efficient with less time consumed and it is becoming unsustainable. There must be a way to reduce the time needed and enable more success at the desktop support level. CCRI is implementing a virtual desktop initiative that will satisfy several requirements of the growing demand being placed on the desktop support staff. Doing away with the annual replacement of \"old\" technology and finding a means of deploying new software without delay are two main focal points of the virtual desktop. With over 3000 computers and 800 laptops on the four campuses, a staff that is not going to get any larger, will find it simpler to virtualize applications and get it to students, faculty and staff faster without having to worry about downtime or long sessions of testing. Additionally, the virtual desktop allows the software to be delivered to the user anytime, anywhere thus eliminating the need for seat-dependent or classroom-dependent copies of software. Concentration can now be placed on getting the right tools to the right people rather than trying to figure out how to load endless software requested on particular classroom computers. Virtual desktop gets the desktop staff out of the business of replacing hard drives, power supplies and tackling virus or malware from desk to desk.","authors":["Stephen A.
