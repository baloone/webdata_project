{"id":"332688534_An_Investigation_of_the_Third_Hankel_Determinant_Problem_for_Certain_Subfamilies_of_Univalent_Functions_Involving_the_Exponential_Function","abstract":"In the current article, we consider certain subfamilies S e ∗ and C e of univalent functions associated with exponential functions which are symmetric along real axis in the region of open unit disk. For these classes our aim is to find the bounds of Hankel determinant of order three. Further, the estimate of third Hankel determinant for the family S e ∗ in this work improve the bounds which was investigated recently. Moreover, the same bounds have been investigated for 2-fold symmetric and 3-fold symmetric functions.","authors":["Lei Shi","Hari Mohan Srivastava","Muhammad Arif","Shehzad Hussain"],"meta":["April 2019Symmetry 11(5):598","DOI:10.3390/sym11050598"],"references":["331592832_Inclusion_relations_for_certain_families_of_integral_operators_associated_with_conic_regions","331588697_Upper_Bound_of_the_Third_Hankel_Determinant_for_a_Subclass_of_q-Starlike_Functions","331288825_Some_Subclasses_of_Uniformly_Univalent_Functions_with_Respect_to_Symmetric_Points","331158966_Hankel_and_Toeplitz_Determinants_for_a_Subclass_of_q-Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_a_General_Conic_Domain","328311264_Third-Order_Hankel_Determinant_for_Certain_Class_of_Analytic_Functions_Related_with_Exponential_Function","328271641_The_Bound_of_the_Hankel_Determinant_of_the_Third_Kind_for_Starlike_Functions","328152336_Some_Coefficient_Inequalities_of_Q-Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_Conic_Domain_Defined_by_Q-Derivative","326189147_The_Sharp_Bound_of_the_Hankel_Determinant_of_the_Third_Kind_for_Starlike_Functions_of_Order_1_2","329389658_Hankel_Determinant_for_a_Subclass_of_Bi-Univalent_Functions_Defined_by_Using_a_Symmetric_q-Derivative_Operator","324231370_THE_SHARP_BOUND_FOR_THE_HANKEL_DETERMINANT_OF_THE_THIRD_KIND_FOR_CONVEX_FUNCTIONS"]}
