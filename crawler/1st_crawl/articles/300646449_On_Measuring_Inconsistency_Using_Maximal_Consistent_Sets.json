{"id":"300646449_On_Measuring_Inconsistency_Using_Maximal_Consistent_Sets","abstract":"An important problem in knowledge-based systems is inconsistency handling. This problem has recently been attracting a lot of attention in AI community. In this paper, we tackle the problem of evaluating the amount of conflicts in knowledge bases, and provide a new fine grained inconsistency measure, denoted MCSC, based on maximal consistent sets. In particular, it is suitable in systems where inconsistency results from multiple consistent sources. We show that our measure satisfies several rational postulates proposed in the literature. Moreover, we provide an encoding in integer linear programming for computing MCSC.","authors":["Meriem Ammoura","Raddaoui Badran","Yakoub Salhi","Brahim Oukacha"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-20807-7_24","Conference: European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning and Uncertainty"],"references":["271914121_Measuring_Inconsistency_in_Multi-Agent_Systems","262288770_Distance-Based_Measures_of_Inconsistency","256660078_Inconsistency_measures_for_probabilistic_logics","220813915_Measuring_conflict_and_agreement_between_two_prioritized_belief_bases","220811880_Quantifying_information_and_contradiction_in_propositional_logic_through_test_actions","220616298_Measuring_inconsistency_in_knowledgebases","220283588_A_general_framework_for_measuring_inconsistency_through_minimal_inconsistent_sets","38356197_Classifications_for_inconsistent_theories","29596665_Measuring_Inconsistency_in_DL-Lite_Ontologies","2479666_Quantifying_Information_and_Contradiction_in_Propositional_Logic_Through_Test_Actions","291072447_Revisiting_Postulates_for_Inconsistency_Measures","280787255_Inconsistency_Measurement_Thanks_to_MUS_Decomposition","266192314_Measuring_inconsistency_in_a_network_intrusion_detection_rule_set_based_on_Snort","227280985_Measuring_Inconsistency","226611442_Minimally_Inconsistent_LP","223432599_Measuring_conflict_and_agreement_between_two_prioritized_knowledge_bases_in_possibilistic_logic","222826318_On_the_measure_of_conflicts_Shapley_Inconsistency_Values","222513209_How_to_act_on_inconsistent_news_Ignore_resolve_or_reject","221239895_A_Verification_Model_for_Electronic_Transaction_Protocols","220907727_How_Dirty_Is_Your_Relational_Database_An_Axiomatic_Approach"]}
