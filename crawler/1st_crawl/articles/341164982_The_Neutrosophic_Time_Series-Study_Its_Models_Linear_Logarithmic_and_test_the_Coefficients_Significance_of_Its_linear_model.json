{"id":"341164982_The_Neutrosophic_Time_Series-Study_Its_Models_Linear_Logarithmic_and_test_the_Coefficients_Significance_of_Its_linear_model","abstract":"In this paper, we present the Neutrosophic time series by studying the classical time series\nwithin the framework of the Neutrosophic logic. (Logic established by the American philosopher and\nmathematician Florentin Smarandache presented it as a generalization of fuzzy logic, especially\nintuitionistic fuzzy logic). As an extension of this, A.A. Salama presented the theory of Neutrosophic\ncrisp sets as a generalization of crisp sets theory. This study enables us to deal with all the time series\nvalues whether it is specified or not specified, we present the linear model for the Neutrosophic time\nseries, and we test the significant of its coefficient based on Student's distribution. We present an\nexample in which we pave the Neutrosophic time series according to the linear model, test the\nsignificant of its coefficient, and show how to deal with the unspecified values of the time series. Then\nwe present the logarithmic model of the Neutrosophic time series. We conclude that the existence of\nindeterminacy in the matter we cannot ignored because it actually affects the estimated values of the\ntime series and thus affects the prediction of the future of the series.","authors":["Rafif Alhabib","A.
