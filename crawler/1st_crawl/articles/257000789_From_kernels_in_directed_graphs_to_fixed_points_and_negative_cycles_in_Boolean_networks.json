{"id":"257000789_From_kernels_in_directed_graphs_to_fixed_points_and_negative_cycles_in_Boolean_networks","abstract":"We consider a class of Boolean networks called and-nets, and we address the question of whether the absence of negative cycle in local interaction graphs implies the existence of a fixed point. By defining correspondences with the notion of kernel in directed graphs, we prove a particular case of this question, and at the same time, we prove new theorems in kernel theory, on the existence and unicity of kernels.","authors":["Adrien Richard","Paul Ruet"],"meta":["May 2013Discrete Applied Mathematics 161(s 7–8):1106–1117","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2012.10.022"],"references":["222829692_Negative_circuits_and_sustained_oscillations_in_asynchronous_automata_networks","220568280_Local_negative_circuits_and_fixed_points_in_non-expansive_Boolean_networks","37811275_The_Origins_of_Order_Self-Organization_and_Selection_in_Evolution","10732808_Multistationarity_the_basis_of_cell_differentiation_and_memory_I_Structural_conditions_of_multistationarity_and_other_nontrivial_behavior","265462109_On_the_Relation_Between_the_Logical_Structure_of_Systems_and_Their_Ability_to_Generate_Multiple_Steady_States_or_Sustained_Oscillations","265367053_Errata_Solutions_of_Irreflexive_Relations","251123055_Basic_Terminology_Notation_and_Results","250138398_Positive_or_negative_regulatory_circuit_inference_from_multilevel_dynamics","228818136_An_extension_of_a_combinatorial_fixed_point_theorem_of_Shih_and_Dong","223067330_A_combinatorial_analogue_of_the_Jacobian_problem_in_automata_networks","222788312_Perfect_graphs_kernels_and_cores_of_cooperative_games","222578735_Graphic_requirements_for_multistability_and_attractive_cycles_in_a_Boolean_dynamical_framework","222431716_Necessary_conditions_for_multistationarity_in_discrete_dynamical_systems","220185624_On_kernels_and_semikernels_of_digraphs","37811203_The_Theory_of_Self-Reproducing_Automata","23158588_From_minimal_signed_circuits_to_the_dynamics_of_Boolean_regulatory_networks","18578234_Boolean_formalization_of_genetic_control_circuits","17383444_Metabolic_Stability_and_Epigenisis_in_Randomly_Connected_Genetic_Nets"]}
