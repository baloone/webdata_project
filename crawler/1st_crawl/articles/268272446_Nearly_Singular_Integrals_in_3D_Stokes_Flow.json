{"id":"268272446_Nearly_Singular_Integrals_in_3D_Stokes_Flow","abstract":"A straightforward method is presented for computing three-dimensional Stokes flow, due to forces on a surface, with high accuracy at points near the sur-face. The flow quantities are written as boundary integrals using the free-space Green's function. To evaluate the integrals near the boundary, the singular kernels are regu-larized and a simple quadrature is applied in coordinate charts. High order accuracy is obtained by adding special corrections for the regularization and discretization er-rors, derived here using local asymptotic analysis. Numerical tests demonstrate the uniform convergence rates of the method.","authors":["Svetlana Tlupova","J Thomas Beale"],"meta":["November 2013Communications in Computational Physics 14(5)","DOI:10.4208/cicp.020812.080213a"],"references":["267557064_A_Fast_Accurate_Boundary_Integral_Method_for_Potentials_on_Closely_Packed_Cells","247931625_The_Method_of_Regularized_Stokeslets","228756838_The_method_of_regularized_Stokeslets_in_three_dimensions_Analysis_validation_and_application_to_helical_swimming","321521132_Applied_Mathematical_Sciences","296730241_Application_of_sigmoidal_transformations_to_weakly_singular_and_near-singular_boundary_element_integrals","266966932_Boundary_Integral_Equations","266750789_A_partially_implicit_hybrid_method_for_computing_interface_motion_in_Stokes_flow","265681716_Vectors_Tensors_and_the_Basic_Equations_of_Fluid_Mechanics","265620792_Introduction_to_Theoretical_and_Computational_Fluid_Dynamics","261992919_Linear_Integral_Equations","260506558_Introduction_to_Theoretical_and_Computational_Fluid_Dynamics","246485525_Integral_Equation_Methods_for_Stokes_Flow_and_Isotropic_Elasticity_in_the_Plane","243778646_Boundary_Integral_And_Singularity_Methods_For_Linearised_Viscous_Flow","242655750_Integral_Equation_Method_in_Scattering_Theory","231911118_Cusping_capture_and_breakup_of_interacting_drops_by_a_curvatureless_boundary-integral_algorithm","229493247_Application_of_sigmoidal_transformations_to_weakly_singular_and_near-singular_boundary_element_integrals","228795542_A_higher_order_numerical_method_for_3-D_doubly_periodic_electromagnetic_scattering_problems","226096311_Helical_distributions_of_Stokeslets","222821705_A_high-order_3D_boundary_integral_equation_solver_for_elliptic_PDEs_in_smooth_domains","222677659_Interfacial_Dynamics_for_Stokes_Flow","222654129_A_Fast_High-Order_Algorithm_for_the_Solution_of_Surface_Scattering_Problems_Basic_Implementation_Tests_and_Applications","222556372_On_the_evaluation_of_layer_potentials_close_to_their_sources","220206888_A_fast_algorithm_for_simulating_vesicle_flows_in_three_dimensions","220206180_Boundary_integral_solutions_of_coupled_Stokes_and_Darcy_flows","220179197_A_Grid-Based_Boundary_Integral_Method_for_Elliptic_Problems_in_Three_Dimensions","30760539_Accelerated_Stokesian_Dynamics_simulations","8040237_A_study_of_bacterial_bundling","2242516_A_Method_for_Computing_Nearly_Singular_Integrals"]}
