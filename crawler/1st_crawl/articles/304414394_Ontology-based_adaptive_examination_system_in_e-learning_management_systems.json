{"id":"304414394_Ontology-based_adaptive_examination_system_in_e-learning_management_systems","abstract":"E-learning environment is spreading in education process especially adaptive e-learning systems. This approach of learning means that learning content is created and distributed in a very different manner to comply with differences among individuals. Providing personalized content is the major research topic for a huge no. of researchers. And sequentially is Computer adaptive test (CAT). Almost all of (CAT) systems' aim is to measure the examinees' ability to solve the selected questions regardless the quality of the learning process. Their objective is to choose the items which have the high probability to be solved with the current ability estimation. The proposed system aim is to measure the examinees' knowledge outcome in addition to evaluate the course itself in order to improve integrity of learning process pipe lines. Evaluating instructors is not based only on survey forms which may be affected by some good or bad feelings; but it also depends some scientific methods.","authors":["Eman Khater","Hegazy Abdelfatah","Mohamed Elemam"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1109/IntelCIS.2015.7397228","Conference: 2015 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS)","Project: Ontology-based adaptive examination system in e-learning management systems"],"references":["238362506_Towards_methodological_principles_for_ontology_engineering","226143316_Implementing_the_Graduate_Management_Admission_Test_Computerized_Adaptive_Test","51962025_Roulette-wheel_selection_via_stochastic_acceptance","50435905_Building_a_chemical_ontology_using_METHON-_TOLOGY_and_the_ontology_design_environment","291784396_Computerized_Adaptive_Testing_A_Primer","254872017_Computerized_adaptive_testing_A_Primer_2nd_Edition","236736642_Computerized_Adaptive_Testing_A_Primer"]}
