{"id":"336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","abstract":"The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor¹. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2,3,4,5,6,7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 2⁵³ (about 10¹⁶). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8,9,10,11,12,13,14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.","authors":["Frank Arute","Kunal Arya","Ryan Babbush","Dave Bacon"],"meta":["October 2019Nature 574(7779):505-510","DOI:10.1038/s41586-019-1666-5"],"references":["336379581_A_flexible_high-performance_simulator_for_verifying_and_benchmarking_quantum_circuits_implemented_on_real_hardware","335412116_Quantum_convolutional_neural_networks","329299787_Massively_parallel_quantum_computer_simulator_eleven_years_later","328581827_On_the_complexity_and_verification_of_quantum_random_circuit_sampling","324104887_Barren_plateaus_in_quantum_neural_network_training_landscapes","324078174_Quantum_Chemistry_Calculations_on_a_Trapped-Ion_Quantum_Simulator","324055328_Tunable_Coupling_Scheme_for_Implementing_High-Fidelity_Two-Qubit_Gates","339858872_Establishing_the_quantum_supremacy_frontier_with_a_281_Pflops_simulation","339522782_Quantum-Teleportation-Inspired_Algorithm_for_Sampling_Large_Random_Quantum_Circuits","327357793_Fluctuations_of_Energy-Relaxation_Times_in_Superconducting_Qubits","323302402_64-Qubit_Quantum_Circuit_Simulation","322243414_Quantum_Computing_in_the_NISQ_era_and_beyond","320442135_Breaking_the_49-Qubit_Barrier_in_the_Simulation_of_Quantum_Circuits","323257435_Classification_with_Quantum_Neural_Networks_on_Near_Term_Processors","321823829_Simulation_of_low-depth_quantum_circuits_as_complex_undirected_graphical_models"]}
