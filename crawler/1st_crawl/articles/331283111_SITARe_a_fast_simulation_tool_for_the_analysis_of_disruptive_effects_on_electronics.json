{"id":"331283111_SITARe_a_fast_simulation_tool_for_the_analysis_of_disruptive_effects_on_electronics","abstract":"This paper is devoted to an exhaustive presentation of a fast computation numerical tool, dedicated to the simulation of transient currents induced by stochastic events in microelectronic devices. This is a part of a numerical platform, SITARe, combining a spice simulator with the semi-analytical model presented here. The paper describes the theoretical model, the calibration. An instance of application illustrates the ability of the tool.","authors":["Gilles Micolau","Karine Coulie-Castellani","Wenceslas Rahajandraibe","J.M.
