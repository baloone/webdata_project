{"id":"325689923_MPC_A_RSUs_deployment_strategy_for_VANET","abstract":"A Vehicle AdHoc Network is mainly composed of mobile vehicles and fixed Road Site Units (RSUs). The latter is usually very expensive to deploy and has a crucial role in maintaining the network connectivity. Therefore, the design of an efficient RSU deployment strategy that enables a high coverage ratio and a lower deployment cost has been of paramount importance. In this respect, we introduce in this paper a new spatiotemporal coverage strategy for nonsafety Vehicle AdHoc Network applications like driving assistance and business promotion, called Minimal Mobility Patterns Coverage (MPC). The main thrust of MPC is to (1) depict the mobility patterns of moving vehicles from their trace files and then (2) compute the adequate RSU locations in order to cover the extracted mobility patterns by the minimal possible number of RSUs. To this end, we firstly provide a new method to depict the mobility patterns of vehicles by mining the correlations between the kept track connections of vehicle trajectories versus crossed junctions. Secondly, we introduce a new way to compute the adequate RSU locations through the instantiation of the well‚Äêknown problem of extracting minimal transversals of a hypergraph. Experimental results show that our RSUs deployment strategy performs better than baseline strategies.","authors":["Taoufik Yeferny","Sabri Allani"],"meta":["June 2018International Journal of Communication Systems 31(4)","DOI:10.1002/dac.3712","Project: Data dissemination and aggregation in vehicular adhoc networks"],"references":["321828834_A_Scalable_Data_Dissemination_Protocol_Based_on_Vehicles_Trajectories_Analysis","258397060_RoadGate_Mobility-Centric_Roadside_Units_Deployment_for_Vehicular_Networks","224010752_On_the_mathematical_theory_of_vehicular_traffic_flow_I_Fluid_dynamic_and_kinetic_modeling","220640262_Probabilistic_Delay_Control_and_Road_Side_Unit_Placement_for_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks_with_Disrupted_Connectivity","7173591_Centrality_Measures_in_Spatial_Networks_of_Urban_Streets","3436240_Broadcast_storm_mitigation_techniques_in_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","3156616_Optimal_Placement_of_Gateways_in_Vehicular_Networks","299375039_QUALITYCOVER_Efficient_binary_relation_coverage_guided_by_induced_knowledge_quality","296116597_Proceedings_of_the_International_Multiconference_on_Computer_Science_and_Information_Technology_IMCSIT_Editorial","288424605_Traffic-Aware_Access-Points_Deployment_Strategies_for_VANETS","285756221_Scalable_TDB_based_RSUs_deployment_in_VANETs","278711118_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","254058364_On_Maximizing_Delay-Constrained_Coverage_of_Urban_Vehicular_Networks","240160860_Ordre_et_classification_algmaobre_et_combinatoire","228653668_Effect_of_Position_of_Fixed_Infrastructure_on_Data_Dissemination_in_VANETs","224310488_Spatial_Propagation_of_Information_in_Vehicular_Networks","224156572_Bidirectionally_Coupled_Network_and_Road_Traffic_Simulation_for_Improved_IVC_Analysis","220926431_Data_aggregation_and_roadside_unit_placement_for_a_VANET_traffic_information_system","220850069_A_Roadside_Unit_Placement_Scheme_for_Vehicular_Telematics_Networks","220211936_Planning_roadside_infrastructure_for_information_dissemination_in_intelligent_transportation_systems","48209988_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Dualizing_Large-Scale_Hypergraphs"]}
