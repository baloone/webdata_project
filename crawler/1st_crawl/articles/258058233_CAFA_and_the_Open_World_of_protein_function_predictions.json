We do not accept anonymous comments. Please include your email address; the address will not be displayed in the posted comment. Cell Press Editors will screen the comments to ensure that they are relevant and appropriate but comments will not be edited.

Note that symbols (e.g. Greek letters) may not transmit properly in this form due to potential software compatibility issues. Please spell out the words in place of the symbols (e.g. replace “α” with “alpha”). Comments should be no more than 8,000 characters (including spaces ) in length. References may be included when necessary but should be kept to a minimum. Be careful if copying and pasting from a Word document. Smart quotes can cause problems in the form. If you experience difficulties, please convert to a plain text file and then copy and paste into the form.","authors":["Christophe Dessimoz","Nives Skunca","Paul D Thomas"],"meta":["October 2013Trends in Genetics 29(11)","DOI:10.1016/j.tig.2013.09.005","SourcePubMed"],"references":["260730887_Reorganizing_the_protein_space_at_the_Universal_Protein_Resource_UniProtThe_UniProt_ConsortiumNucleic_Acids_Res201140D1D71D75324512022102590","235375403_A_large-scale_evaluation_of_computational_protein_function_prediction","234028756_The_Gene_Ontology_in_2010_extensions_and_refinements_The_Gene_Ontology_Consortium","225301997_Quality_of_Computationally_Inferred_Gene_Ontology_Annotations","221855988_On_the_Use_of_Gene_Ontology_Annotations_to_Assess_Functional_Similarity_among_Orthologs_and_Paralogs_A_Short_Report","51832897_The_UniProt-GO_Annotation_database_in_2011","51808307_InterPro_in_2011_New_developments_in_the_family_and_domain_prediction_database","44711723_The_Gene_Ontology_in_2010_extensions_and_refinements","310441655_Reorganizing_the_protein_space_at_the_Universal_Protein_Resource_UniProt","283304597_A_large-scale_evaluation_of_computational_protein_function_prediction"]}
