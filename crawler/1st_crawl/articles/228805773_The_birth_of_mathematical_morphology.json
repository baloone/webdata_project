{"id":"228805773_The_birth_of_mathematical_morphology","abstract":"Foreword It may be useful to add a few lines in preamble of the document below, in order to explain the context. Following G. Matheron's retirement, in December 1996, one could hear the most fanciful tales concerning the birth of Mathematical Morphology. I told G. Matheron about them, which prompted our decision to clarify this question publicly before the Research Committee of the Ecole des Mines. We sketched an outline together and I took charge of the first draft, which I transmitted to G. Matheron a few weeks later. We discussed it and produced the final version published here for the first time. We attended together the Research Committee meeting, during which we were granted a right of reply of a half hour. This was the last act of presence of G. Matheron at the Ecole des Mines de Paris. When somebody asked him which memories he had today of these remote days, he answered \"They were the happiest in my life\".","authors":["G Matheron","Jean Serra"],"meta":["November 2001"],"references":["292022690_Remarques_sur_une_lame_mince_de_minerai_lorrain","284685755_Morphologie_mathematique_et_granulometrie_en_place","237127862_Random_Sets_and_Integral_Geometry","229755875_Stereology_and_structuring_elements","226665935_Les_structures_gigognes_morphologie_mathmatique_et_interprtation_mtallognique","44555376_Elements_Pour_Une_Theorie_Des_Milieux_Poreux"]}
