{"id":"342934129_A_Bayesian_estimation_method_for_variational_phase-field_fracture_problems","abstract":"In this work, we propose a parameter estimation framework for fracture propagation problems. The fracture problem is described by a phase-field method. Parameter estimation is realized with a Bayesian approach. Here, the focus is on uncertainties arising in the solid material parameters and the critical energy release rate. A reference value (obtained on a sufficiently refined mesh) as the replacement of measurement data will be chosen, and their posterior distribution is obtained. Due to time- and mesh dependencies of the problem, the computational costs can be high. Using Bayesian inversion, we solve the problem on a relatively coarse mesh and fit the parameters. In several numerical examples our proposed framework is substantiated and the obtained load-displacement curves, that are usually the target functions, are matched with the reference values.","authors":["Amirreza Khodadadian","Nima Noii","Maryam Parvizi","Mostafa Abbaszadeh"],"meta":["October 2020Computational Mechanics 66(8)","DOI:10.1007/s00466-020-01876-4"],"references":["337628641_An_adaptive_global-local_approach_for_phase-field_modeling_of_anisotropic_brittle_fracture","337229680_Bayesian_inversion_for_nanowire_field-effect_sensors","334597863_A_new_method_for_selective_functionalization_of_silicon_nanowire_sensors_and_Bayesian_inversion_for_its_parameters","325227933_A_non-intrusive_globallocal_approach_applied_to_phase-field_modeling_of_brittle_fracture","321499936_The_Variational_Approach_to_Fracture","335353658_Mesh_adaptivity_for_quasi-static_phase-field_fractures_based_on_a_residual-type_a_posteriori_error_estimator","332420204_A_phase-field_description_for_pressurized_and_non-isothermal_propagating_fractures","330199879_Characterization_of_elastic-plastic_coated_material_properties_by_indentation_techniques_using_optimisation_algorithms_and_finite_element_analysis","329725016_Parallel_solution_adaptivity_computational_convergence_and_open-source_code_of_2d_and_3d_pressurized_phase-field_fracture_problems","326190744_Phase-Field_Modeling_of_Brittle_Fracture_Using_an_Efficient_Virtual_Element_Scheme"]}
