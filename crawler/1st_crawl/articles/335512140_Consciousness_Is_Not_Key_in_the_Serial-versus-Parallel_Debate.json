{"id":"335512140_Consciousness_Is_Not_Key_in_the_Serial-versus-Parallel_Debate","abstract":"In response to our recent claim that Readers are Parallel Processors (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2019.04.006), two excellent commentary letters were written by respectively Schotter & Payne, and White, Boynton & Yeatman. \nThis is our rebuttal, wherein we emphasize that the serial-versus-parallel debate is not about whether or not words are consciously identified one-by-one, but rather whether ongoing word processing (lexical activation, syntactic and semantic processing) can proceed for multiple words in parallel. We also share more ideas for future research, in the hopes to move together with our peers towards broad scientific consensus.","authors":["Joshua Snell","Jonathan Grainger"],"meta":["August 2019Trends in Cognitive Sciences 23(10)","DOI:10.1016/j.tics.2019.07.010"],"references":["333383404_Readers_Are_Parallel_Processors","332632621_Parallel_cascaded_interactive_processing_of_words_during_sentence_reading","328509245_You_That_Read_Wrong_Again_A_Transposed-Word_Effect_in_Grammaticality_Judgments","326857734_OB1-Reader_A_Model_of_Word_Recognition_and_Eye_Movements_in_Text_Reading","325002128_Evidence_of_Serial_Processing_in_Visual_Word_Recognition","318436214_The_sentence_superiority_effect_revisited","335507403_You_Can't_Recognize_Two_Words_Simultaneously","335506911_Eye_Movements_and_Comprehension_Are_Important_to_Reading","332278336_Parallel_spatial_channels_converge_at_a_bottleneck_in_anterior_word-selective_cortex","319409942_Evidence_of_serial_processing_in_visual_word_recognition"]}
