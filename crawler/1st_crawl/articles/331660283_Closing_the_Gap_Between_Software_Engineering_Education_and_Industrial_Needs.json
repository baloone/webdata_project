{"id":"331660283_Closing_the_Gap_Between_Software_Engineering_Education_and_Industrial_Needs","abstract":"According to different reports, many recent software engineering graduates often face difficulties when beginning their professional careers, due to misalignment of the skills learnt in their university education with what is needed in industry. To address that need, many studies have been conducted to align software engineering education with industry needs. To synthesize that body of knowledge, we present in this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) which summarizes the findings of 33 studies in this area. By doing a meta-analysis of all those studies and using data from 12 countries and over 4,000 data points, this study will enable educators and hiring managers to adapt their education / hiring efforts to best prepare the software engineering workforce.","authors":["Vahid Garousi","Görkem Giray","Eray Tüzün","Cagatay Catal"],"meta":["March 2020IEEE Software 37(2):68 - 77","DOI:10.1109/MS.2018.2880823"],"references":["342364539_Software_Engineering_Body_of_Knowledge_SWEBOK_Guide","322060213_We_know_about_software_test_maturity_and_test_process_improvement","319893490_Exploring_the_importance_of_soft_and_hard_skills_as_perceived_by_IT_internship_students_and_industry_A_gap_analysis","311488521_Industry_expectations_of_soft_skills_in_IT_graduates_A_regional_survey","308878035_Desired_Skills_for_Entry_Level_IS_Positions_Identification_and_Assessment","325726433_Are_computer_science_and_engineering_graduates_ready_for_the_software_industry_experiences_from_an_industrial_student_training_program","323609649_Employers'_Needs_for_Computer_Science_Information_Technology_and_Software_Engineering_Skills_Among_New_Graduates","321684847_Software_University_Courses_versus_Workplace_Practice","315117289_Knowledge_and_Skills_Requirements_for_Software_Developer_Students","308873427_What_Makes_a_Great_Software_Engineer"]}
