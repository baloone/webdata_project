{"id":"222679264_Vertex-Coloring_2-Edge-Weighting_of_Graphs","abstract":"A k-edge-weightingw of a graph G is an assignment of an integer weight, w(e)∈{1,…,k}, to each edge e. An edge weighting naturally induces a vertex coloring c by defining c(u)=∑u∼ew(e) for every u∈V(G). A k-edge-weighting of a graph G is vertex-coloring if the induced coloring c is proper, i.e., c(u)≠c(v) for any edge uv∈E(G).Given a graph G and a vertex coloring c0, does there exist an edge-weighting such that the induced vertex coloring is c0? We investigate this problem by considering edge-weightings defined on an abelian group.It was proved that every 3-colorable graph admits a vertex-coloring 3-edge-weighting (Karoński et al. (2004) [12]). Does every 2-colorable graph (i.e., bipartite graphs) admit a vertex-coloring 2-edge-weighting? We obtain several simple sufficient conditions for graphs to be vertex-coloring 2-edge-weighting. In particular, we show that 3-connected bipartite graphs admit vertex-coloring 2-edge-weighting.","authors":["Hongliang Lu","Qinglin Yu","Cun-quan Zhang"],"meta":["January 2011European Journal of Combinatorics 32(1):21-27","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2010.08.002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220075635_Vertex-coloring_edge-weightings_Towards_the_1-2-3-conjecture","278543742_Vertex-distinguishing_edge_colorings_of_graphs","262154698_Vertex-distinguishing_edge_colorings_of_graphs","248321426_Vertex-Distinguishing_Proper_Edge-Colorings","246543947_Irregular_assignments_and_vertex-distinguishing_edge-colorings_of_graphs","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","231945578_The_Harmonious_Chromatic_Number_of_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","226963348_On_vertex-coloring_13-edge-weighting","220570958_Degree_constrained_subgraphs","220441404_Vertex-Colouring_Edge-Weightings","220074779_Vertex_coloring_edge_partitions","200621929_Modern_Graph_Theory"]}
