{"id":"285850994_A_Novel_Optimization_Method_to_Automated_Wet-Etch_Station_Scheduling_in_Semiconductor_Manufacturing_Systems","abstract":"This work addresses the short-term scheduling of one of the most critical stages in the semiconductor industry, the automated wet-etch station (AWS). An efficient MILP-based computer-aided tool is developed in order to achieve a proper synchronization between the activities o f sequential chemical an d water baths and limited automated wafer's lot transfer devices. The major goal is to find the optimal integrated schedule that maximizes the whole process productivity without generating wafer contamination.","authors":["Adrián M.
