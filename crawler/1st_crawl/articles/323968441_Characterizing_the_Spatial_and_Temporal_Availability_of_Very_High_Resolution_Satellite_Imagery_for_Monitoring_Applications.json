{"id":"323968441_Characterizing_the_Spatial_and_Temporal_Availability_of_Very_High_Resolution_Satellite_Imagery_for_Monitoring_Applications","abstract":"Very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery from Google Earth and Bing Maps is increasingly being used in a variety of applications from computer sciences to arts and humanities. In the field of remote sensing, this imagery is used to create detailed time-sensitive maps, e.g. for emergency response purposes, or to validate coarser resolution products such as global land cover maps. However, little is known about where VHR satellite imagery exists globally or the dates of the imagery. Here we present a global snapshot of the spatial and temporal distribution of VHR satellite imagery in Google Earth and Bing Maps. The results show an uneven availability globally, with biases in certain areas such as the USA, Europe and India. We also show that the availability of VHR imagery is currently not adequate for monitoring protected areas and deforestation, but is better suited for monitoring changes in cropland or urban areas.
