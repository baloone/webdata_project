{"id":"346302290_A_Mixed-Methods_Evaluation_of_a_Hybrid_Course_Modality_to_Increase_Student_Engagement_and_Mastery_of_Course_Content_in_Undergraduate_Research_Methods_Classes","abstract":"An undergraduate Research Methods in Criminal Justice class was taught in two different modalities, traditional and hybrid, over 8 semesters. The hybrid course sought to increase student engagement through student-driven active learning modules delivered online while maintaining mastery of course content. Using a mixed-methods research design, engagement with course material was evaluated by assessing a mid-semester student survey in the hybrid offerings and comparing the two modalities using qualitative and quantitative data from end of semester student ratings of teaching effectiveness. Mastery of course content was assessed by comparing exam scores between the two modalities. Qualitative data suggest greater course engagement among students enrolled in the hybrid sections. A quantitative analysis revealed significantly higher average mean test scores among students in the hybrid group across all three exams. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research and extensions of the hybrid modality to other criminal justice courses.","authors":["Eileen Ahlin"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Criminal
