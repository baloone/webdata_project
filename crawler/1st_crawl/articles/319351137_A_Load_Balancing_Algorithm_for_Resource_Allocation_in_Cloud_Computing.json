{"id":"319351137_A_Load_Balancing_Algorithm_for_Resource_Allocation_in_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"Utilizing dynamic resource allocation for load balancing is considered as an important optimization process of task scheduling in cloud computing. A poor scheduling policy may overload certain virtual machines while remaining virtual machines are idle. Accordingly, this paper proposes a hybrid load balancing algorithm with combination of Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) and Grey Wolves Optimization algorithms (GWO), which can well contribute in maximizing the throughput using well balanced load across virtual machines and overcome the problem of trap into local optimum. The hybrid algorithm is benchmarked on eleven test functions and a comparative study is conducted to verify the results with particle swarm optimization (PSO), Biogeography-based optimization (BBO), and GWO. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for load balancing, the hybrid algorithm is simulated and the experimental results are presented. 1 Introduction Cloud computing is an emerging technology and new trend for computing based on virtualization of resources [1]. In cloud environment the physical machines run multiple virtual machines (VM) which are presented to the clients as the computing resources. The architecture of a VM is based on a physical computer with similar functionality [2]. In fact VM is a guest program with software resources functioning similar to a physical computer. Resource allocation technique is an important process to allocate resources based on user's application demands to achieve an optimal number of servers in use [3]. This process is done dynamically for the purpose of load balancing of non-preemptive tasks. Load balancing is an NP-hard optimization problem in cloud computing. This technique strives to balance the workload across VMs, which aims to minimize response time in order to keep promises and quality of service in accordance with service level agreements (SLA) between the clients and the provider.","authors":["Seyedmajid Mousavi","Amir Mosavi","Annamaria R.
