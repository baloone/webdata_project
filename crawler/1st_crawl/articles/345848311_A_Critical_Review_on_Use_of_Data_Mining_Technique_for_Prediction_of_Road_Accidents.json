{"id":"345848311_A_Critical_Review_on_Use_of_Data_Mining_Technique_for_Prediction_of_Road_Accidents","abstract":"Road accidents in India have become one of the serious issues that need to be resolved. The statistics revealed that India's 3% of total gross domestic product (GDP) is getting waste in road crashes. This issue not only causes the social problem but the financial burden to the country as well. In order to reduce accidents, several techniques have been given by different researchers, but modeling road accidents using computer science techniques has gained increasing attention over the years as they have the power to predict road accidents with high accuracy. Practically, road crashes are rare events, thus the binary-dependent variable is categorized by dozens to thousands of times rarer events (accidents) than non-rare events (non-accidents). This paper aims at introducing a review of data mining (DM) applications for the analysis of road crash data in road safety and the most commonly available data mining software in the market with their advantages and disadvantages. The study concluded that DM technique can be used by different government agencies and departments for sustainable road management.","authors":["Navdeep Mor","Hemant Sood","Tripta Goyal"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-981-15-7907-3_11"],"references":["331225571_Data_Mining_and_Machine_Learning_to_Promote_Smart_Cities_A_Systematic_Review_from_2000_to_2018","331059282_Data_mining_applications_in_transportation_engineering","317421409_Road_Traffic_Accidents_in_India_Issues_and_Challenges","303899564_Using_Data_Mining_Technique_to_Predict_Cause_of_Accident_and_Accident_Prone_Locations_on_Highways","301707407_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Traffic_Accident_Modeling_and_Prediction_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates","272870129_Road_Safety_Analysis_in_Gyor","271261216_A_Data_Mining_Approach_to_Identify_Key_Factors_of_Traffic_Injury_Severity","269775327_A_Crash_Severity-Based_Black_Spot_Identification_Model","267398137_A_Perspective_Analysis_of_Traffic_Accident_using_Data_Mining_Techniques","263711177_A_review_of_models_relevant_to_road_safety","26526470_Data_mining_applications_in_transportation_engineering","236178626_Aspects_of_Road-Accident_Death_Analyses","232655637_Traffic_Incident_Duration_Prediction_Based_on_Artificial_Neural_Network","232628551_Severity_Analyses_of_Single-Vehicle_Crashes_Based_on_Rough_Set_Theory","222383371_A_method_of_measuring_exposure_to_pedestrian_accident_risk"]}
