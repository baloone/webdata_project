{"id":"295863661_The_Effects_of_Test_Driven_Development_on_Internal_Quality_External_Quality_and_Productivity_A_systematic_review","abstract":"Context: Test Driven Development (TDD) is an agile practice that has gained popularity when it was defined as a fundamental part in eXtreme Programming (XP). Objective: This study analyzed the conclusions of previously published articles on the effects of TDD on internal and external software quality and productivity, comparing TDD with Test Last Development (TLD). Method: In this study, a systematic literature review has been conducted considering articles published between 1999 and 2014. Results: In about 57% of the analyzed studies, the results were validated through experiments and in 32% of them, validation was performed through a case study. The results of this analysis show that 76% of the studies have identified a significant increase in internal software quality while 88% of the studies identified a meaningful increase in external software quality. There was an increase in productivity in the academic environment, while in the industrial scenario there was a decrease in productivity. Overall, about 44% of the studies indicated lower productivity when using TDD compared to TLD. Conclusion: According to our findings, TDD yields more benefits than TLD for internal and external software quality, but it results in lower developer productivity than TLD.","authors":["Wilson Bissi","Adolfo Gustavo Serra Seca Neto","Maria Claudia Figueiredo Pereira Emer"],"meta":["February 2016Information and Software Technology 74","DOI:10.1016/j.infsof.2016.02.004","Project: Evaluation of Agile Methods and Practices"],"references":["302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","261072107_How_the_Practice_of_TDD_Influences_Class_Design_in_Object-Oriented_Systems_Patterns_of_Unit_Tests_Feedback","260649027_The_Effects_of_Test-Driven_Development_on_External_Quality_and_Productivity_A_Meta-Analysis","259992054_Considering_Rigor_and_Relevance_when_Evaluating_Test_Driven_Development_A_Systematic_Review","313446650_Towards_empirical_evaluation_of_test-driven_development_in_a_university_environment","304160532_On_the_Influence_of_Test-Driven_Development_on_Software_Design","304160443_Evaluating_Test-Driven_Development_in_an_Industry-Sponsored_Capstone_Project","304160208_Test-Driven_Learning_in_Early_Programming_Courses","280645955_Systematic_Reviews_in_the_Social_Sciences_A_Practical_Guide","261075446_Systematic_literature_studies_Database_searches_vs_backward_snowballing"]}
