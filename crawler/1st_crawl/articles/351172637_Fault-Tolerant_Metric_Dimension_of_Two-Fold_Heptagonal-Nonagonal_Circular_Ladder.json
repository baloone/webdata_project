{"id":"351172637_Fault-Tolerant_Metric_Dimension_of_Two-Fold_Heptagonal-Nonagonal_Circular_Ladder","abstract":"The problem of characterizing the classes of plane graphs with the bounded metric dimension, edge metric dimension, and fault-tolerant metric dimension is of great interest nowadays. In this paper, we study the metric dimension, the fault-tolerant metric dimension, and the edge metric dimension of a two-fold heptagonal-nonagonal circular ladder (denoted by [Formula: see text]). We show that the metric dimension and the edge metric dimension of [Formula: see text] are the same. We also study its fault-tolerant metric dimension and prove that the metric basis and the edge metric basis sets are independent.","authors":["Sunny KUMAR Sharma","Vijay Kumar Bhat"],"meta":["April 2021Discrete Mathematics Algorithms and Applications","DOI:10.1142/S1793830921501329"],"references":["343347695_Computing_the_edge_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes_related_graphs","349639786_Graphs_with_the_edge_metric_dimension_smaller_than_the_metric_dimension","334860639_Edge_Metric_Dimension_of_Some_Graph_Operations"]}
