{"id":"4355018_Separating_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy_by_oracles","abstract":"We present exponential lower bounds on the size of depth-k Boolean circuits for computing certain functions. These results imply that there exists an oracle set A such that, relative to A, all the levels in the polynomial-time hierarchy are distinct, i.e., ΣkP,A is properly contained in Σk+1P,A for all k.","authors":["Andrew Chi-Chih Yao"],"meta":["November 1985Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on","DOI:10.1109/SFCS.1985.49","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Foundations of Computer Science, 1985., 26th Annual Symposium on"],"references":["234804082_On_monotone_formulae_with_restricted_depth","262247897_Relativized_Questions_Involving_Probabilistic_Algorithms","256554871_A_second_step_toward_the_polynomial_hierarchy","242911284_Relative_to_a_Random_Oracle_A_bf_PA_ne_bf_NPA_ne_textco-bf_NPA_with_Probability_1","242807208_-Formulae_on_Finite_Structures","238831367_Relativizations_of_the_mathcalP_mathcalNP_Question","234829345_Languages_which_capture_complexity_classes","225264758_Parity_circuits_and_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy","222459053_The_polynomial_hierarchy","222240977_On_counting_problems_and_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy","221590808_Borel_Sets_and_Circuit_Complexity","221499650_The_Equivalence_Problem_for_Regular_Expressions_with_Squaring_Requires_Exponential_Space","220618012_Quantitative_Relativizations_of_Complexity_Classes","220574407_Threshold_Functions_and_Bounded_Depth_Monotone_Circuits","220431058_Relativized_Questions_Involving_Probabilistic_Algorithms","220268297_Exponential_Lower_Bounds_for_Restricted_Monotone_Circuits","4354915_Lower_bounds_by_probabilistic_arguments"]}
