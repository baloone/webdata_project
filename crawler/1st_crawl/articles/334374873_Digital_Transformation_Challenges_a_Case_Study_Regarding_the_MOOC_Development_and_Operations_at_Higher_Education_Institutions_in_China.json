{"id":"334374873_Digital_Transformation_Challenges_a_Case_Study_Regarding_the_MOOC_Development_and_Operations_at_Higher_Education_Institutions_in_China","abstract":"As development and operation of the massive open online courses (MOOCs) involve multiple stakeholders to work in cooperation, this paper inquired two key stakeholders in the MOOC development, teaching, and operation: administrators and faculty in 50 higher education institutions in China. We sought the experiences and expectations from MOOC administrators and faculty. The result showed that the government and institutions held either sole or joint leadership in MOOC development and operation. Although colleges and universities in China have established certain mechanisms to develop and operate MOOCs, they faced challenges and issues such as insufficient technical support, inadequate curriculum/instructional design training, and a lack of national curriculum/instructional design and development standards as well as platform standards. In the end, the paper provided some suggestions for improving the development and operation of MOOCs in China.","authors":["Mingzhuo Liu","Shenghua Zha","Wu He"],"meta":["July 2019TechTrends 63(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11528-019-00409-y"],"references":["320025594_Institutional_Collaboration_on_MOOCs_in_Education-A_Literature_Review","297420303_Validation_of_Non-formal_MOOC-based_Learning_An_Analysis_of_Assessment_and_Recognition_Practices_in_Europe","287717473_Investigating_MOOCs_through_blog_mining","282610361_Public_Response_to_the_MOOC_Movement_in_China_Examining_the_Time_Series_of_Microblogging","276247459_Influencing_Factors_of_Success_and_Failure_in_MOOC_and_General_Analysis_of_Learner_Behavior","271841177_MOOCs_Expectations_and_reality","260205419_The_MOOC_model_for_digital_practice","237091973_Studying_Learning_in_the_Worldwide_Classroom_Research_into_edX's_First_MOOC","326310589_The_Development_of_MOOC_and_Its_Impact_on_Higher_Education_in_China","309962493_Learner_control_user_characteristics_platform_difference_and_their_role_in_adoption_intention_for_MOOC_learning_in_China","287690737_Managing_E-Learning_Strategies_Design_Delivery_Implementation_and_Evaluation","277827926_Things_to_think_about_in_e-learning","262239039_The_Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Mobile_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_Platform"]}
