{"id":"2821926_Graph_Layout_through_the_VCG_Tool","abstract":"The VCG tool allows the visualization of graphs that occur typically as data structures in programs. We describe the functionality of the VCG tool, its layout algorithm and its heuristics. Our main emphasis in the selection of methods is to achieve a very good performance for the layout of large graphs. The tool supports the partitioning of edges and nodes into edge classes and nested subgraphs, the folding of regions, and the management of priorities of edges. The algorithm produces good drawings and runs reasonably fast even on very large graphs.
