{"id":"2114770_Asymptotically_fast_group_operations_on_Jacobians_of_general_curves","abstract":"Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g$ over a field $k$. We describe probabilistic algorithms for addition and inversion of the classes of rational divisors in the Jacobian of $C$. After a precomputation, which is done only once for the curve $C$, the algorithms use only linear algebra in vector spaces of dimension at most $O(g \\log g)$, and so take $O(g^{3 + \\epsilon})$ field operations in $k$, using Gaussian elimination. Using fast algorithms for the linear algebra, one can improve this time to $O(g^{2.376})$. This represents a significant improvement over the previous record of $O(g^4)$ field operations (also after a precomputation) for general curves of genus $g$.","authors":["Kamal Khuri-Makdisi"],"meta":["October 2004Mathematics of Computation 76(260)","DOI:10.1090/S0025-5718-07-01989-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["256845040_A_Sampling_of_Vector_Bundle_Techniques_in_the_Study_of_Linear_Series","37443131_Algebraic_Complexity_Theory","2613318_Primary_Decomposition_Algorithms_and_Comparisons","268657082_The_Jacobian_Variety_of_an_Algebraic_Curve","256844620_Principles_of_Algebraic_Geometry","244407431_ON_DENSITY_OF_PRIMITIVE_ELEMENTS_FOR_FIELD_EXTENSIONS","239059459_Computing_in_the_Jacobian_of_a_Hyperelliptic_Curve","222877053_Computing_Riemann-Roch_Spaces_in_Algebraic_Function_Fields_and_Related_Topics","222703624_Efficient_Decomposition_of_Associative_Algebras_over_Finite_Fields","221591803_Matrix_Multiplication_via_Arithmetic_Progressions","221499145_Efficient_Algorithms_for_the_Riemann-Roch_Problem_and_for_Addition_in_the_Jacobian_of_a_Curve_Extended_Abstract","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220162039_Matrix_Multiplication_via_Arithmetic_Progressions","220161494_Efficient_Algorithms_for_the_Riemann-Roch_Problem_and_for_Addition_in_the_Jacobian_of_a_Curve","44491243_Algebraic_geometry_arcata_1974_edited_by_Robin_Hartshorne","30867274_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Computer_Algorithms","2733307_A_Linear_Lower_Bound_on_the_Gonality_of_Modular_Curves","2441585_The_Calculation_of_Radical_Ideals_in_Positive_Characteristic","2399983_Abeliants_And_Their_Application_To_An_Elementary_Construction_Of_Jacobians","2098977_Linear_algebra_algorithms_for_divisors_on_an_algebraic_curve"]}
