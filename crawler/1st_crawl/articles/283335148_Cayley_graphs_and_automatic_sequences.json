{"id":"283335148_Cayley_graphs_and_automatic_sequences","abstract":"We study those automatic sequences which are produced by an automaton whose\nunderlying graph is the Cayley graph of a finite group. For $2$-automatic\nsequences, we find a characterization in terms of what we call homogeneity, and\namong homogeneous sequences, we single out those enjoying what we call\nself-similarity. It turns out that self-similar $2$-automatic sequences (viewed\nup to a permutation of their alphabet) are in bijection with many interesting\nobjects, for example dessins d'enfants (covers of the Riemann sphere with three\npoints removed).\nFor any $p$ we show that, in the case of an automatic sequence produced \"by a\nCayley graph\", the group and indeed the automaton can be recovered canonically\nfrom the sequence.\nFurther, we show that a rational fraction may be associated to any automatic\nsequence. To compute this fraction explicitly, knowledge of a certain graph is\nrequired. We prove that for the sequences studied in the first part, the graph\nis simply the Cayley graph that we start from, and so calculations are\npossible.\nWe give applications to the study of the frequencies of letters.","authors":["Pierre Guillot"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics 45(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10801-016-0706-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258201513_Automatic_congruences_for_diagonals_of_rational_functions","276132234_An_elementary_approach_to_dessins_d'enfants_and_the_Grothendieck-Teichmuller_group","273526388_WHAT_ISan_Automatic_Sequence","256465058_An_elementary_approach_to_dessins_d'enfants_and_the_Grothendieck-Teichmuller_group","220719832_On_the_Frequency_of_Letters_in_Morphic_Sequences","220695808_Automata-Theoretic_Aspects_of_Formal_Power_Series","220690295_Automatic_Sequences_Theory_Applications_Generalizations"]}
