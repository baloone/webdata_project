{"id":"220370937_Distance_and_Measurement_in_Domain_Theory","abstract":"We investigate the notion of distance on domains. In particular, we show that measurement is a fundamental concept underlying partial metrics by proving that a domain in its Scott topology is partially metrizable only if it admits a measurement. Conversely, the natural notion of a distance associated with a measurement not only yields meaningful partial metrics on domains of essential importance in computation, such as I\n, Σ∞ and\nω, it also serves as a useful theoretical device by allowing one to establish the existence of partial metrics on arbitrary ω-continuous dcpo's.","authors":["Pawel Waszkiewicz"],"meta":["November 2001Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 45:448-462","DOI:10.1016/S1571-0661(04)80975-7","SourceDBLP"],"references":["2735925_Domain_Theory","267652898_Partial_metrics_valuations_and_domain_theory","243768113_A_foundation_for_computation","243069669_Distance_Functions_and_the_Metrization_Problem","229470329_Partial_Metrics_Valuations_and_Domain_Theory","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology","222445084_A_computational_model_for_metric_spaces","220608510_Sobriety_in_Terms_of_Nets","2513449_Approximation_of_Metric_Spaces_by_Partial_Metric_Spaces"]}
