{"id":"319875764_A_Constructor-Based_Reachability_Logic_for_Rewrite_Theories","abstract":"Reachability logic has been applied to $\\mathbb{K}$ rewrite-rule-based language definitions as a language-generic logic of programs. To be able to verify not just code but also distributed system designs, a new rewrite-theory-generic reachability logic is presented and proved sound for a wide class of rewrite theories. The logic's automation is increased by means of constructor-based semantic unification, matching, and satisfiability procedures. New methods for proving invariants of possibly never terminating distributed systems are developed, and experiments with a prototype implementation illustrating the new proof methods are presented.","authors":["Stephen Skeirik","Andrei Stefanescu","Jose Meseguer"],"meta":["September 2017Fundamenta Informaticae 173(4)","DOI:10.3233/FI-2020-1926"],"references":["280853066_Verifying_Reachability-Logic_Properties_on_Rewriting-Logic_Specifications","278743362_Normal_forms_and_normal_theories_in_conditional_rewriting","222300945_Symbolic_Reachability_Analysis_Using_Narrowing_and_its_Application_to_Verification_of_Cryptographic_Protocols","324142554_Metalevel_algorithms_for_variant_satisfiability","321629438_Variant-based_satisfiability_in_initial_algebras","310823795_Semantics-based_program_verifiers_for_all_languages","309184065_Rewriting_modulo_SMT_and_open_system_analysis","306262307_Variant-Based_Satisfiability_in_Initial_Algebras","306261651_Metalevel_Algorithms_for_Variant_Satisfiability","265775796_All-Path_Reachability_Logic","234806074_Initiality_induction_and_computability","220744151_Fostering_Proof_Scores_in_CafeOBJ","47655345_WITHDRAWN_On_the_Church-Rosser_and_coherence_properties_of_conditional_order-sorted_rewrite_theories","2712723_Rewrite_Systems"]}
