{"id":"265373941_Conforming_and_nonconforming_finite_element_methods_for_solving_the_stationary_Stokes_equations_I","abstract":"The paper is devoted to a general finite element approximation of the solution of the Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid. Both conforming and nonconforming finite-element methods are studied and various examples of simplistic elements well suited for the numerical treatment of the incompressibility condition are given. Optimal error estimates are derived in the energy norm and in the L**2-norm.","authors":["M. Crouzeix","P.-A.
