{"id":"228887510_On_Accurate_Localization_and_Uncertain_Sensors","abstract":"The necessity of accurate localization in mobile robotics is obvious -if a robot does not know where it is, it cannot navigate accurately and reach goal locations. Robots learn about their environment via sensors. Small robots require small, efficient, and, if they are to be deployed in large numbers, inexpensive sensors. The sensors used by robots to perceive the world are inherently inaccurate, providing noisy, erroneous data or even no data at all. Combined with estimation error due to imperfect modelling of the robot, there are many obstacles to successfully localizing in the world. Sensor fusion is used to overcome these difficulties -combining the available sensor data in order to derive a more accurate pose estimation for the robot. A feeling of \"ready-fire-aim\" pervades the discipline -filters are chosen on little to no information, and new filters are simply tested against a few peers and claimed as superior to all others. This is folly -the most appropriate filter is seldom the newest. This article provides an overview and in-depth tutorial of all modern robot localization methods and throughly discusses their strengths and weaknesses in order to assist a robot researcher in the task of choosing the most appropriate filter for their task.","authors":["Jeffrey Kramer","Abraham Kandel"],"meta":["May 2012International Journal of Intelligent Systems 25(23)","DOI:10.1002/int.21530"],"references":["246470737_Information_Complexity_and_Fuzzy_Control","233338716_Are_fuzzy_systems_universal_approximators","228572685_A_novel_data_fusion_approach_in_an_integrated_gpsins_system_using_adaptive_fuzzy_particle_filter","227943866_The_Uses_of_Fuzzy_Logic_in_Autonomous_Robot_Navigation","221605299_Monte_Carlo_Localization_Efficient_Position_Estimation_for_Mobile_Robots","221604522_Hybrid_Inference_for_Sensor_Network_Localization_Using_a_Mobile_Robot","221077764_Sensor_Fusion_Based_on_Fuzzy_Kalman_Filtering_for_Autonomous_Robot_Vehicle","221021372_Fuzzy_Adaptive_Particle_Filter_for_Localization_of_a_Mobile_Robot","322276903_The_unscented_particle_filter","322276704_Sigma-point_Kalman_filters_for_probabilistic_inference_in_dynamic_state-space_models","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","313311489_Improved_Kalman_Filter_Initialisation_using_Neurofuzzy_Estimation","312623183_A_new_extension_of_the_Kalman_filter_to_nonlinear_systems","302221108_Adaptive_filtering","284462342_Fuzzy_Sets_Outline_of_a_New_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_and_Decision_Processes","273453883_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","268312030_Fuzzy_controls_under_product-sum-gravity_methods_and_new_fuzzy_control_methods","264585676_Blanche-An_experiment_in_guidance_and_navigation_of_an_autonomous_mobile_Robot","260259673_Probabilistic_Robotics","256410545_Fuzzy_inference_and_its_applicability_to_control_systems","254708185_Accurate_localization_given_uncertain_sensors","247019481_On_sequential_Monte_Carlo_methods_for_Bayesian_filtering","243776639_The_Calculation_of_Posterior_Distributions_by_Data_Augmentation_Comment_A_Noniterative_SamplingImportance_Resampling_Alternative_to_the_Data_Augmentation_Algorithm_for_Creating_a_Few_Imputations_When_","243769869_Bayesian_state_estimation_for_tracking_and_guidance_using_the_bootstrap_filter","242800070_On_the_observability_of_fuzzy_dynamical_control_systems_I","235656843_Stochastic_Simulation_Algorithms_for_Dynamic_Probabilistic_Networks","234820347_Navigating_Mobile_Robots_Systems_and_Techniques","234014394_The_Monte_Carlo_method","233205509_A_principle_of_uncertainty_and_information_invariance","230561986_Fuzzy_logic_in_control_systems_Fuzzy_logic_controller","229792333_A_generalized_defuzzification_method_under_BADD_distribution","228611276_Sensor_fusion_for_robot_navigation_using_a_fuzzy-ekf_with_weighted_covariance","227280412_CONDENSATION-conditional_density_propagation_for_visual_tracking","225075551_A_New_Approach_to_Linear_Filtering_and_Prediction_Problems","224839919_A_New_Approach_To_Linear_Filtering_and_Prediction_Problems","224744358_Ultrasonic_self-localization_and_pose_tracking_of_an_autonomous_mobile_robot_via_fuzzy_adaptive_extended_information_filtering","224719817_Localisation_in_urban_environment_using_GPS_and_INS_aided_by_monocular_vision_system_and_3D_geographical_model","224581659_Least-squares_estimation_from_Gauss_to_Kalman","224567960_Fuzzy_approaches_to_driven_Kalman_filtering_for_small_robot_localization","224391019_On-Line_Detection_Correction_of_Kalman_Filter_Divergence_by_Fuzzy_Logic","224381731_Improved_Global_Localization_and_Pose_Tracking_of_an_Autonomous_Mobile_Robot_Via_Fuzzy_Adaptive_Extended_Information_Filtering","224112343_Outline_of_a_New_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_and_Decision_Processes_IEEE_Transactions_on_Systems_Man_and_Cybernetics_SMC_vol3128-45","224065735_Bayesian_estimation_and_Kalman_filtering_a_unified_framework_for_mobile_robot_localization","223891369_Development_of_an_automated_fuzzy-logic-based_expert_system_for_unmanned_landing","223771747_Design_and_implementation_of_a_fuzzy_supervisor_for_on-line_compensation_of_nonlinearities_An_instability_avoidance_module","223080507_Modeling_a_dynamic_environment_using_a_Bayesian_multiple_hypothesis_approach","222707929_Multisensor_On-the-Fly_Localization_Precision_and_Reliability_for_Applications","222324241_Multi-sensor_fusion_an_Evolutionary_algorithm_approach","220739691_A_New_Approach_to_Improve_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","220689095_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Fuzzy_Logic","220122328_Fast_Ego-motion_Estimation_with_Multi-rate_Fusion_of_Inertial_and_Vision","220313786_Exponential_data_weighting_in_the_Kalman-Bucy_filter","220159506_New_Developments_in_State_Estimation_of_Nonlinear_Systems","220103840_Improved_global_localization_of_an_indoor_mobile_robot_via_fuzzy_extended_information_filtering","215721589_Stochastic_Models_Estimation_and_Control"]}
