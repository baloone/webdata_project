{"id":"325051881_The_Gm-contraction_principle_for_mappings_on_an_M-metric_spaces_endowed_with_a_graph_and_fixed_point_theorems","abstract":"Fixed point theory is a very important tool in mathematics and applied sciences. Latterly, many application examples have been presented for communication network and computer science field [1], [2]. The proposed schema can be considered as a theoretical foundation for such type of applications. In this paper we introduce the notion of the Gm-contraction to generalize and extend the notion of G-contraction. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of fixed point for such contractions in M-metric space endowed with a graph. Our results extend and generalize various results in the existing literature in particular the results of Jachymski [3]. Some examples are included which illustrate the results proved herein.
