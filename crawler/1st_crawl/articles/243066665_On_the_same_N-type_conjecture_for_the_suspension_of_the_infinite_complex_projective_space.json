{"id":"243066665_On_the_same_N-type_conjecture_for_the_suspension_of_the_infinite_complex_projective_space","abstract":"Let [Φik, [Φik-1,..., [Φi1, Φi2],...]] be an iterated commutator of self-maps Φij. on the suspension of the infinite complex projective space. In this paper, we produce useful self-maps of the form I +[Φik, [Φik-1,..., [Φi1, Φi2],...]], where + means the addition of maps on the suspension structure of ΣℂP∞. We then give the answer to the conjecture saying that the set of all the same homotopy n-types of the suspension of the infinite complex projective space is the one element set consisting of a single homotopy type.","authors":["Dae-Woong Lee"],"meta":["March 2008Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 137(03):1161-1168","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9939-08-09666-4"],"references":["299126226_Projective_elements_in_K-theory_and_self_maps_of_Sigma_CP_infinity","267136214_An_example_in_homotopy_theory","266538678_An_example_in_homotopy_theory","266015908_Phantom_Maps_and_Rational_Equivalences","264960845_Torsion_in_Homotopy_Groups","256364631_On_spaces_with_the_same_n-type_for_all_n","256364528_Spaces_of_the_same_n-type_for_all_n","254207723_Projective_elements_in_K-theory_and_self_maps_of_sum_CPinfty","248725334_Phantom_maps_and_spaces_of_the_same_n-type_for_all_n","247481964_Self_Maps_of_Projective_Spaces","243059394_Classification_of_Spaces_of_the_Same_n-Type_for_All_n","243030678_An_example_in_homotopy_theory","225162541_On_infinite_dimensional_spaces_that_are_rationally_equivalent_to_a_Bouquet_of_spheres","50334283_Elements_of_Homotopy_Theory","31221286_Homotopical_Localization","27294098_Homotopy_Limits_Completions_and_Localizations"]}
