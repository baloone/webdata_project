{"id":"339889682_Prevalence_of_comorbidities_and_its_effects_in_patients_infected_with_SARS-CoV-2_a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","abstract":"Background: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China; the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.\n\nAims: The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infected patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. \n\nMethods: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models.\n\nResults: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86–97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59–76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34–68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21–40%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0–27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2– 12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8–13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9–2.1%). When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46–3.83), 2.46 (95% CI: 1.76–3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88–6.22) respectively.\n\nConclusion: We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 patients and found that underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe patients compared with non-severe patients.","authors":["Jing Yang","Ya Zheng","Xi Gou","Ke Pu"],"meta":["March 2020International journal of infectious diseases: IJID: official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases 94:91-95","DOI:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017"],"references":["339581314_Clinical_Characteristics_of_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_in_China","339459928_Initial_public_health_response_and_interim_clinical_guidance_for_the_2019_novel_coronavirus_outbreak_-_United_States_December_31_2019-February_4_2020","339380514_Clinical_characteristics_of_140_patients_infected_by_SARS-CoV-2_in_Wuhan_China","339210982_Clinical_characteristics_of_novel_coronavirus_cases_in_tertiary_hospitals_in_Hubei_Province","339112553_Clinical_Characteristics_of_138_Hospitalized_Patients_With_2019_Novel_Coronavirus-Infected_Pneumonia_in_Wuhan_China","339058627_Initial_Public_Health_Response_and_Interim_Clinical_Guidance_for_the_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_Outbreak_-_United_States_December_31_2019-February_4_2020","344941723_The_Epidemiological_Characteristics_of_an_Outbreak_of_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_Diseases_COVID-19_-_China_2020","339298142_Clinical_features_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_in_the_early_stage_from_a_fever_clinic_in_Beijing","339176279_Clinical_and_biochemical_indexes_from_2019-nCoV_infected_patients_linked_to_viral_loads_and_lung_injury","338933612_Genomic_characterisation_and_epidemiology_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_implications_for_virus_origins_and_receptor_binding"]}
