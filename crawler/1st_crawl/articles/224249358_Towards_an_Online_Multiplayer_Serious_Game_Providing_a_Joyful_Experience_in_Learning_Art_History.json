{"id":"224249358_Towards_an_Online_Multiplayer_Serious_Game_Providing_a_Joyful_Experience_in_Learning_Art_History","abstract":"Using prevalent teaching methods, such as classroom teaching, art historical facts can be tedious to communicate. Especially when it concentrates on teaching artists names, artworks and their corresponding era of art. Knowing about the cultural-historical background of art history can play an important role in raising a student's interest in contemporary culture and cultural heritage. We propose the online multiplayer Serious Game ThIATRO that helps students learn art history. This playful approach is intended to not only increases the motivation to learn but also compel the player to think about, organize and use information in ways that encourage active construction of knowledge.","authors":["Josef Wolfartsberger","Max Arends","Doron Goldfarb","Dieter Merkl"],"meta":["June 2011","DOI:10.1109/VS-GAMES.2011.47","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications (VS-GAMES), 2011 Third International Conference on"],"references":["234789305_Enhancing_the_educational_value_of_video_games","232416401_A_lightweight_XML_driven_architecture_for_the_presentation_of_virtual_cultural_exhibitions_ARCOLite","228938508_Experience_with_serious_games_for_learning_foreign_languages_and_cultures","228680386_User_centered_game_design_Evaluating_massive_multiplayer_online_role_playing_games_for_Second_Language_Acquisition","221308821_Kurio_A_museum_guide_for_families","221038689_A_game-engine_based_virtual_museum_authoring_and_presentation_system","221033626_Mystery_at_the_museum_a_collaborative_game_for_museum_education","221010858_Building_Virtual_and_Augmented_Reality_museum_exhibitions","247930603_Using_animation_and_interactive_virtual_technology_to_create_interpretive_materials_for_museum_learning_and_promotion","235316599_Digital_Natives_Digital_Immigrants_Part_1"]}
