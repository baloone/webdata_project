{"id":"356640705_Exploring_the_Usability_of_Virtual_Robotics_Programming_Curriculum_for_Robotics_Programming_Teaching","abstract":"This study aims to explore the usability of the virtual robotics programming curriculum (VRP-C) for robotics programming teaching. Pre-service computer science (CS) teachers were trained for robotics programming teaching by using VRP-C in a scientific education activity. After training, views of the participants were revealed by using a scale and an evaluation form consisting of open-ended questions. Results show that VRP-C is compatible with the curriculum for robotics programming teaching in schools, and pre-service CS teachers tend to use VRP-C in their courses. They think that VRP-C will be beneficial for robotics programming teaching in terms of content, functionality, and cost. Compatibility, visual design, feedback, time management, fiction, gamification, and cost are the characteristics that increase the usability of VRP-C. VRP-C can be used as an online tool for robotics programming training due to the necessity of transition to distance education because of the COVID-19 pandemic.","authors":["Servet Kılıç","Seyfullah Gökoğlu"],"meta":["November 2021Informatics in Education","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2022.20"],"references":["331424647_Teachers'_goals_predict_computational_thinking_gains_in_robotics","323455570_Developing_The_Acceptance_Scale_Of_LEGO_Robotics_Instructional_Practices_Validity_And_Reliability_Studies","301676970_A_review_Can_robots_reshape_K-12_STEM_education","292995504_Can_Computational_Thinking_Be_Taught_In_Robotics_Classrooms","321137502_Attending_to_structural_programming_features_predicts_differences_in_learning_and_motivation_in_a_virtual_robotics_programming_curriculum","320679330_Developing_Computational_Thinking_through_a_Virtual_Robotics_Programming_Curriculum","316652754_Different_underlying_motivations_and_abilities_predict_student_versus_teacher_persistence_in_an_online_course","314191072_Assessing_elementary_students'_computational_thinking_in_everyday_reasoning_and_robotics_programming","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","297056469_Educational_robotics_as_a_learning_tool_for_promoting_rich_environments_for_active_learning_REALs","292074357_Factors_Affecting_ICT_Adoption_among_Distance_Education_Students_based_on_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model-A_Case_Study_at_a_Distance_Education_University_in_Iran","283453083_Advancing_students'_computational_thinking_skills_through_educational_robotics_A_study_on_age_and_gender_relevant_differences","279642720_What_is_Educational_Robotics_Theories_behind_it_and_practical_implementation","276835949_Comparing_Virtual_and_Physical_Robotics_Environments_for_Supporting_Complex_Systems_and_Computational_Thinking","265092184_Constructionism_in_Practice_Designing_Thinking_and_Learning_in_a_Digital_World"]}
