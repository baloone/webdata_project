{"id":"337858612_A_Genetic_Algorithm_Approach_to_Multi-Agent_Mission_Planning_Problems","abstract":"Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have received great attention from scholars and engineers in different domains, including computer science and robotics. MASs try to solve complex and challenging problems (e.g., a mission) by dividing them into smaller problem instances (e.g., tasks) that are allocated to the individual autonomous entities (e.g., agents). By fulfilling their individual goals, they lead to the solution to the overall mission. A mission typically involves a large number of agents and tasks, as well as additional constraints, e.g., coming from the required equipment for completing a given task. Addressing such problem can be extremely complicated for the human operator, and several automated approaches fall short of scalability. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm for the automation of multi-agent mission planning. In particular, the contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the mission planning problem is cast into an Extended Colored Traveling Salesperson Problem (ECTSP), formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. Second, a precedence constraint reparation algorithm to allow the usage of common variation operators for ECTSP is developed. Finally, a new objective function minimizing the mission makespan for multi-agent mission planning problems is proposed.","authors":["Branko Miloradovic","Baran Çürüklü","Mikael Ekström","Alessandro Vittorio Papadopoulos"],"meta":["December 2019Communications in Computer and Information Science 1162","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-37584-3_6"],"references":["331439150_Extended_Colored_Traveling_Salesperson_for_Modeling_Multi-Agent_Mission_Planning_Problems","330477210_Adaptive_Autonomy_in_a_Search_and_Rescue_Scenario","324847369_Multi-Agent_Systems_A_survey","316685076_A_Genetic_Mission_Planner_for_Solving_Temporal_Multi-agent_Problems_with_Concurrent_Tasks","315886590_Underwater_Robot_Task_Planning_Using_Multi-Objective_Meta-Heuristics","325762946_Weighted_strategies_to_guide_a_multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithm_for_multi-UAV_mission_planning","318801103_A_research_framework_on_mission_planning_of_the_UAV_swarm","318386035_An_efficient_genetic_algorithm_to_solve_the_resource-constrained_project_scheduling_problem_with_transfer_times_The_single_mode_case","318294108_New_Artificial_Intelligence_approaches_for_future_UAV_Ground_Control_Stations","317596163_Variable_Neighborhood_Search_for_a_Colored_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","311457196_Combining_and_Projecting_Flow_Models_for_the_Precedence_Constrained_Asymmetric_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","309345848_A_taxonomy_for_task_allocation_problems_with_temporal_and_ordering_constraints","308994035_A_genetic_planner_for_mission_planning_of_cooperative_agents_in_an_underwater_environment","308877714_Solving_complex_multi-UAV_mission_planning_problems_using_multi-objective_genetic_algorithms","315595668_Handling_swarm_of_UAVs_based_on_evolutionary_multi-objective_optimization"]}
