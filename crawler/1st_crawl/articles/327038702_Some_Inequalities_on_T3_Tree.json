{"id":"327038702_Some_Inequalities_on_T3_Tree","abstract":"The article proves several inequalities derived from nodal multiplication on\nT3\ntree. The proved inequalities are helpful to estimate certain quantities related\nwith the T\n3 tree as well as examples of proving an inequality embedded\nwith the floor functions.","authors":["Xingbo Wang"],"meta":["January 2018Advances in Pure Mathematics 08(08):711-719","DOI:10.4236/apm.2018.88043","Project: rsa factorization"],"references":["326503795_Brief_Investigation_on_Square_Root_of_a_Node_of_T_3_Tree","326037107_A_Parallel_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Factorize_a_Semiprime","325445032_T_3_Tree_and_Its_Traits_in_Understanding_Integers","323851542_Some_New_Inequalities_With_Proofs_and_Comments_on_Applications","317193636_Two_More_Symmetric_Properties_of_Odd_Numbers","316913462_Strategy_for_Algorithm_Design_in_Factoring_RSA_Numbers","314954446_Genetic_Traits_of_Odd_Numbers_with_Applications_in_Factorization_of_Integers","311761879_Amusing_Properties_of_Odd_Numbers_Derived_From_Valuated_Binary_Tree","302589769_Valuated_Binary_Tree_A_New_Approach_in_Study_of_Integers"]}
