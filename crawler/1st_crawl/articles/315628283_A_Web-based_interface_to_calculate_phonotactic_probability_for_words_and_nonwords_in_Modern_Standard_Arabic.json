{"id":"315628283_A_Web-based_interface_to_calculate_phonotactic_probability_for_words_and_nonwords_in_Modern_Standard_Arabic","abstract":"A number of databases (Storkel Behavior Research Methods, 45, 1159–1167, 2013) and online calculators (Vitevitch & Luce Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers, 36, 481–487, 2004) have been developed to provide statistical information about various aspects of language, and these have proven to be invaluable assets to researchers, clinicians, and instructors in the language sciences. The number of such resources for English is quite large and continues to grow, whereas the number of such resources for other languages is much smaller. This article describes the development of a Web-based interface to calculate phonotactic probability in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). A full description of how the calculator can be used is provided. It can be freely accessed at http://phonotactic.drupal.ku.edu/.","authors":["Faisal Aljasser","Michael S Vitevitch"],"meta":["March 2017Behavior Research Methods
