{"id":"312908213_Lane_changing_on_the_motorway_factors_affecting_its_occurrence_and_their_implications","abstract":"This paper presents results on a possible model for lane change gap acceptance on a three lane motorway, and demonstrates the macroscopic validity of such a model through implementation in a microscopic motorway simulation model. Brief results are presented demonstrating the potential impact that driver education could have in increasing the observance of the KLEWO regulation in the Highway Code. The paper demonstrates that it is possible to formulate reasonably accurate behavioural models for lane changing, based on alternative sets of variables according to modelling and data collection constraints. Research is continuing into the effect of flow levels on the decision process and on the incorporation of an increased degree of fuzzy modelling. It is anticipated that a fully fuzzy approach will enable us to explain the variabilities in a more comprehensive way.","authors":["Mark Brackstone","M.
