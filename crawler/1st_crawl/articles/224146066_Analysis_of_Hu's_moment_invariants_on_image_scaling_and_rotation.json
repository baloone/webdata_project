{"id":"224146066_Analysis_of_Hu's_moment_invariants_on_image_scaling_and_rotation","abstract":"Moment invariants have been widely applied to image pattern recognition in a variety of applications due to its invariant features on image translation, scaling and rotation. The moments are strictly invariant for the continuous function. However, in practical applications images are discrete. Consequently, the moment invariants may change over image geometric transformation. To address this research problem, an analysis with respect to the variation of moment invariants on image geometric transformation is presented, so as to analyze the effect of image's scaling and rotation. Finally, the guidance is also provided for minimizing the fluctuation of moment invariants.","authors":["Zhihu Huang","J.
