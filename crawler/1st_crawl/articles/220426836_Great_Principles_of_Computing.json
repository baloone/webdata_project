{"id":"220426836_Great_Principles_of_Computing","abstract":"Peter J. Denning focuses on the evolution of computing and its principles. At the start of World War II, the militaries of the US and UK became interested in applying computation to the calculation of ballistic and navigation tables and to the cracking of ciphers. During its youth, computing was an enigma to the established fields of science and engineering. The term computational thinking has become popular to refer to the mode of thought that accompanies design and discovery done with computation. Peter refers to the Great Principles of Computing framework he and his colleagues developed. These principles fall into seven categories: computation, communication, coordination, recollection, automation, evaluation and design. A representation is a pattern of symbols that stands for something. The association between a representation and what it stands for can be recorded as a link in a table or database, or as a memory in people's brains.","authors":["Peter Denning"],"meta":["November 2003Communications of the ACM 46(11):15-20","DOI:10.1002/9780470050118.ecse548","SourceDBLP"],"references":["215930210_The_Feyman_Lectures_on_Physics","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","285441778_The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics","238701796_Great_ideas_in_computer_science","238700662_Great_ideas_in_computer_science_with_java","238676527_The_Pattern_On_the_Stone","220478735_Computing_as_a_discipline","200680168_Computer_programming_as_an_art","48078064_Cosmos","17148133_Computer_Science"]}
