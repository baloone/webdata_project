{"id":"283680994_Nonoccurring_Behavior_Analytics_A_New_Area","abstract":"Nonoccurring behaviors (NOBs) refer to those behaviors that should happen but do not take place for some reasons. They are widely seen in online, business, government, health, medical, scientific, and social data and applications. Very limited research has been undertaken to explore such behaviors owing to their invisibility and the significant challenges in analyzing NOBs. This article outlines the concept, intrinsic characteristics, significant challenges, main issues, research directions, and state-of-the-art work related to NOBs, followed by the prospects for and applications of NOB analytics.","authors":["Longbing Cao","Philip S.
