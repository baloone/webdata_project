{"id":"249731229_Embodiment_Academics_and_the_Audit_Culture_A_Story_Seeking_Consideration","abstract":"In response to the plea by Pelias (2004) for a methodology of the heart, this article presents a story about the embodied struggles of an academic at a university that is permeated by an audit culture. It is based on informal interviews with academics at various universities in England and selected personal experiences. Thus, the constructive process is inspired by partial happenings, fragmented memories, echoes of conversations, whispers in corridors, fleeting glimpses of myriad reflections seen through broken glass, and multiple layers of fiction and narrative imaginings. Methodological issues abound in the telling and showing but, quite rightly, remain dormant on this occasion. In the end, the story simply asks for your consideration.","authors":["Andrew Sparkes"],"meta":["November 2007Qualitative Research 7(4):521-550","DOI:10.1177/1468794107082306"],"references":["313659621_Bodies_identities_selves_Autoethnographic_fragments_and_reflections","307633232_Autoethnography_Self-indulgence_or_something_more","249735760_Getting_Personal_Reflexivity_and_Autoethnographic_Vignettes","249714199_Analyzing_Analytic_AutoethnographyAn_Autopsy","287004129_Fictional_Representations_On_Difference_Choice_and_Risk","279598295_Making_the_Case_for_Poetic_Representations_An_Example_in_Action","269521301_Breaking_Out_Again_Feminist_Ontology_And_Epistemology","261773556_Feminist_Praxis_Research_Theory_and_Epistemology_in_Feminist_Sociology","258207458_Feminist_Theory_and_the_Body","249825277_Called_to_Account_The_CV_as_an_Autobiographical_Practice","249735376_The_Fatal_Flaw_A_Narrative_of_the_Fragile_Body-Self","249714198_Analytic_Autoethnography_or_Deja_Vu_all_Over_Again","248067015_The_Wounded_Story_Teller","246182972_Fields_of_Play_Constructing_an_Academic_Life","240526780_Poetic_Representations_in_Sport_and_Physical_Education_Insider_Perspectives_1","234667987_Performative_Writing_as_Scholarship_An_Apology_an_Argument_an_Anecdote","222217824_The_physical_activity_experiences_of_men_with_serious_mental_illness_Three_short_stories","200027189_Writing_A_Method_of_Inquiry","27399293_Researching_life_stories_Method_theory_and_analyses_in_a_biographical_age"]}
