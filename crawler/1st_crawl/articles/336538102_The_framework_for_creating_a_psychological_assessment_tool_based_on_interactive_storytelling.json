{"id":"336538102_The_framework_for_creating_a_psychological_assessment_tool_based_on_interactive_storytelling","abstract":"In recent years personality assessment utilizing computer science methods has received a lot of interest among researchers. Many teams are looking to use different approaches to measure personality traits, using technology as an alternative to self-report based questionnaires. Many interesting studies have been carried out using social behavior analysis, natural language analysis or player modeling in a computer game. However, despite being promising, the results also show that the effectiveness of these solutions has definitely an area for development. Additionally, it should be noted that the theoretical underpinnings in psychology regarding personality models, in particular, the Big Five model, are extensive. And hold the promise that a combination of such psychological theory and computer science has a lot more to offer. In this publication, we propose a method that allows to design and manufacture a personality assessment tool, using an interactive story in which the user makes choices and actions on the basis of which her/his trait standings are estimated.","authors":["Marcin Prys","Przemysław Różewski","Matthias Ziegler"],"meta":["January 2019Procedia Computer Science 159(28):2206-2215","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.395"],"references":["331752499_Personality_in_Situations_Going_Beyond_the_OCEAN_and_Introducing_the_Situation_Five","329960429_Multi-criteria_decision_support_for_planning_and_evaluation_of_performance_of_viral_marketing_campaigns_in_social_networks","326541537_Generalised_framework_for_multi-criteria_method_selection","309375962_Player_Behavior_Modeling_for_Interactive_Storytelling_in_Games","304412617_Personality_classification_based_on_Twitter_text_using_Naive_Bayes_KNN_and_SVM","286390842_Recognising_personality_traits_using_facebook_status_updates","312638171_Fusing_Social_Media_Cues_Personality_Prediction_from_Twitter_and_Instagram","303835137_50_Facets_of_a_Trait_-_50_Ways_to_Mess_Up","300386878_Personality_Traits_Below_Facets_The_Consensual_Validity_Longitudinal_Stability_Heritability_and_Utility_of_Personality_Nuances","291421753_Towards_a_system_of_customized_video_game_mechanics_based_on_player_personality_Relating_the_Big_Five_personality_traits_with_difficulty_adaptation"]}
