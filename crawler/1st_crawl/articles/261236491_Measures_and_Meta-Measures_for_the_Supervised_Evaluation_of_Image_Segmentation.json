{"id":"261236491_Measures_and_Meta-Measures_for_the_Supervised_Evaluation_of_Image_Segmentation","abstract":"This paper tackles the supervised evaluation of image segmentation algorithms. First, it surveys and structures the measures used to compare the segmentation results with a ground truth database, and proposes a new measure: the precision-recall for objects and parts. To compare the goodness of these measures, it defines three quantitative meta-measures involving six state of the art segmentation methods. The meta-measures consist in assuming some plausible hypotheses about the results and assessing how well each measure reflects these hypotheses. As a conclusion, this paper proposes the precision-recall curves for boundaries and for objects-and-parts as the tool of choice for the supervised evaluation of image segmentation. We make the datasets and code of all the measures publicly available.","authors":["Jordi Pont-Tuset","Ferran Marques"],"meta":["June 2013Proceedings / CVPR, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
