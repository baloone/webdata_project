{"id":"282072541_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Regular_Ideals","abstract":"The state complexity of a regular language is the number of states in a\nminimal deterministic finite automaton accepting the language. The syntactic\ncomplexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup.\nThe syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the worst-case\nsyntactic complexity taken as a function of the state complexity $n$ of\nlanguages in that class. We prove that $n^{n-1}$, $n^{n-1}+n-1$, and\n$n^{n-2}+(n-2)2^{n-2}+1$ are tight upper bounds on the syntactic complexities\nof right ideals and prefix-closed languages, left ideals and suffix-closed\nlanguages, and two-sided ideals and factor-closed languages, respectively.\nMoreover, we show that the transition semigroups meeting the upper bounds for\nall three types of ideals are unique, and the numbers of generators (4, 5, and\n6, respectively) cannot be reduced.","authors":["Janusz Brzozowski","Marek Szyku≈Ça","Yuli Ye"],"meta":["July 2018Theory of Computing Systems 62(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-017-9803-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319489076_Syntactic_complexity_of_suffix-free_languages","318140519_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Bifix-Free_Languages","301870808_State_Complexity_and_the_Monoid_of_Transformations_of_a_Finite_Set","301648141_Syntactic_complexity_of_bifix-free_languages","283518703_Estimates_of_the_number_of_states_of_finite_automata","281529114_Sur_les_suites_infinies_de_fonctions_definies_dans_les_ensembles_quelconques","269339553_Upper_Bound_on_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Suffix-Free_Languages","267439070_Finite_Automata","267201171_Syntactic_Complexities_of_Some_Classes_of_Star-Free_Languages","265677369_Some_Combinatorial_Properties_of_Factorial_Languages"]}
