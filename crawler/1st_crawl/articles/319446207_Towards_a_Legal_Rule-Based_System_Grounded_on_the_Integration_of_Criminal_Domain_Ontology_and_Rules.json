{"id":"319446207_Towards_a_Legal_Rule-Based_System_Grounded_on_the_Integration_of_Criminal_Domain_Ontology_and_Rules","abstract":"This research aims to define an integrated strategy for modelling legal norms in the criminal domain for supporting the legal reasoning. For this purpose, OWL-DL criminal domain ontology is captured from legal texts, using a middle-out approach, and legal rules are then formalized based on the ontology. The goal is to construct a legal rule-based decision support system for the Lebanese criminal domain, grounded on the integration of the criminal domain ontology and set of logic rules which are defined using the expressive ability of SWRL rule language.","authors":["Mirna El Ghosh","Hala Naja","Habib Abdulrab","Mohamad A Khalil"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Computer Science 112:632-642","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.109"],"references":["314521901_Ontology_Learning_Process_as_a_Bottom-up_Strategy_for_Building_Domain-specific_Ontology_from_Legal_Texts","304814412_Towards_a_Middle-out_Approach_for_Building_Legal_Domain_Reference_Ontology","283318337_Legal_Expert_Systems_The_Inadequacy_of_a_Rule-Based_Approach","283316905_A_Pragmatic_Legal_Expert_System","326341675_Query_Answering_for_OWL-DL_with_rules","289858325_ROWLer_-_A_hybrid_rule_engine_for_legal_reasoning","288363150_Research_on_Construction_and_SWRL_Reasoning_of_Ontology_of_Maize_Diseases","269032076_Description_logic_programs","268978965_Classical_Negation_in_Logic_Programs_and_Deductive_Databases","265258452_Legal_Rules_Text_and_Ontologies_Over_Time"]}
