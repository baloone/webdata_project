{"id":"276939158_Implicit_Stereotype_Content","abstract":"The stereotype content model (SCM) postulates that stereotype content can be mixed in terms of diverging evaluations on the warmth and competence dimensions. The present study is the first to demonstrate this with implicit measures. Two Implicit Associations Tests (IATs) were developed, one capturing the warmth dimension and the other the competence dimension. Both IATs compared preschool teachers (stereotypically warm and incompetent) with lawyers (stereotypically cold and competent). As predicted, two samples of students from various areas of study showed the mixed implicit stereotypes, while a group of preschool-teacher students showed a univalent positive implicit stereotype of their own group, suggesting in-group favoritism. The results support the SCM.","authors":["Rickard Carlsson","Fredrik Bj√∂rklund"],"meta":["January 2010Social Psychology 41(4):213-222","DOI:10.1027/1864-9335/a000029"],"references":["247784628_Discrimination_and_the_Implicit_Association_Test","247720407_Implicit_and_Explicit_Consequences_of_Exposure_to_Violent_and_Misogynous_Rap_Music","38413489_Pervasiveness_and_Correlates_of_Implicit_Attitudes_and_Stereotypes","26655629_Understanding_and_Using_the_Implicit_Association_Test_III_Meta-Analysis_of_Predictive_Validity","11321314_A_model_of_often_mixed_stereotype_content_Competence_and_warmth_respectively_follow_from_perceived_status_and_competition","11215089_Implicit_Measures_in_Social_Cognition_Research_Their_Meaning_and_Use","10614534_Understanding_and_Using_the_Implicit_Association_Test_I_An_Improved_Scoring_Algorithm","8110281_Understanding_and_Using_the_Implicit_Association_Test_II_Method_Variables_and_Construct_Validity","7337614_Arbitrary_Metrics_in_Psychology","6781407_Stereotyping_and_Evaluation_in_Implicit_Race_Bias_Evidence_for_Independent_Constructs_and_Unique_Effects_on_Behavior","6360012_The_BIAS_Map_Behaviors_from_Intergroup_Affect_and_Stereotypes","325670955_A_model_of_often_mixed_stereotype_content_Competence_and_warmth_respectively_follow_from_perceived_status_and_competition","310334116_Implicit_and_Explicit_Consequences_of_Exposure_to_Violent_and_Misogynous_Rap_Music","279800614_Understanding_and_Using_the_Implicit_Association_Test_I_An_Improved_Scoring_Algorithm","250064576_3_Understanding_and_Using_the_Implicit_Association_Test_IV","237809323_What_Do_Implicit_Measures_Tell_Us_Scrutinizing_the_Validity_of_Three_Common_Assumptions","237243542_Stereotype_content_model_across_cultures_To_wards_universal_similarities_and_some_differences","225768033_The_Structure_of_Female_Subgroups_An_Exploration_of_Ambivalent_Stereotypes","23958917_Stereotype_content_model_across_cultures_Towards_universal_similarities_and_some_differences","15321390_Implicit_Social_Cognition_Attitudes_Self-Esteem_and_Stereotypes","13629558_Measuring_Individual_Differences_in_Implicit_Cognition_The_Implicit_Association_Test","7617121_A_Meta-Analysis_on_the_Correlation_Between_the_Implicit_Association_Test_and_Explicit_Self-Report_Measures","7453328_Moderators_of_the_Relationship_Between_Implicit_and_Explicit_Evaluation","7131971_The_Influence_of_One's_Own_Body_Weight_on_Implicit_and_Explicit_Anti-Fat_Bias","6611134_Universal_Dimensions_of_Social_Cognition_Warmth_and_Competence"]}
