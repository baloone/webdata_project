{"id":"280969636_Minority_Population_in_the_One-Dimensional_Schelling_Model_of_Segregation","abstract":"The Schelling model of segregation looks to explain the way in which a\npopulation of agents or particles of two types may come to organise itself into\nlarge homogeneous clusters, and can be seen as a variant of the Ising model in\nwhich the system is subjected to rapid cooling. While the model has been very\nextensively studied, the unperturbed (noiseless) version has largely resisted\nrigorous analysis, with most results in the literature pertaining to versions\nof the model in which noise is introduced into the dynamics so as to make it\namenable to standard techniques from statistical mechanics or stochastic\nevolutionary game theory. We rigorously analyse the one-dimensional version of\nthe model in which one of the two types is in the minority, and establish\nvarious forms of threshold behaviour. Our results are in sharp contrast with\nthe case when the distribution of the two types is uniform (i.e. each agent has\nequal chance of being of each type in the initial configuration), which was\nstudied by Brandt, Immorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg.","authors":["George Barmpalias","Richard Elwes","Andy Lewis-Pye"],"meta":["December 2018Journal of Statistical Physics 173(6)","DOI:10.1007/s10955-018-2146-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["287396979_Emergence_of_Frontiers_in_Networked_Schelling_Segregationist_Models","281885178_How_to_Prevent_Intolerant_Agents_from_High_Segregation","343010045_Individual_Strategy_and_Social_Structure_An_Evolutionary_Theory_of_Institutions","329648617_Growing_Artificial_Societies_Social_Science_from_the_Bottom_Up","312077874_Exponential_Segregation_in_a_Two-Dimensional_Schelling_Model_with_Tolerant_Individuals","305881947_Unperturbed_Schelling_segregation_in_two_or_three_dimensions","303620146_Tipping_Points_in_1-dimensional_Schelling_Models_with_Switching_Agents","303620052_Digital_Morphogenesis_via_Schelling_Segregation","283912710_Clustering_and_Mixing_Times_for_Segregation_Models_on_Z_2","283658774_Exponential_Segregation_in_a_Two-Dimensional_Schelling_Model_with_Tolerant_Individuals"]}
