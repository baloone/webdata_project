{"id":"329163835_Evaluation_of_Speech-to-Gesture_Generation_Using_Bi-Directional_LSTM_Network","abstract":"We present a novel framework to automatically generate natural\ngesture motions accompanying speech from audio utterances.\nBased on a Bi-Directional LSTM Network, our deep network learns\nspeech-gesture relationships with both backward and forward consistencies\nover a long period of time. Our network regresses a full\n3D skeletal pose of a human from perceptual features extracted\nfrom the input audio in each time step. Then, we apply combined\ntemporal filters to smooth out the generated pose sequences. We\nutilize a speech-gesture dataset recorded with a headset and markerbased\nmotion capture to train our network. We validated our approach\nwith a subjective evaluation and compared it against “original”\nhuman gestures and “mismatched” human gestures taken from\na different utterance. The evaluation result shows that our generated\ngestures are significantly better than the “mismatched” gestures\nwith respect to time consistency. The generated gesture also\nshows marginally significant improvement in terms of semantic\nconsistency when compared to “mismatched” gestures.","authors":["Dai Hasegawa","Naoshi KANEKO","Shinichi Shirakawa","Hiroshi Sakuta"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.1145/3267851.3267878","Conference: 18th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA2018)At: SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA."],"references":["313397132_What_is_Qualitative_Interviewing","283807716_Predicting_Co-verbal_Gestures_A_Deep_and_Temporal_Modeling_Approach","317172800_Creating_a_Gesture-Speech_Dataset_for_Speech-Based_Automatic_Gesture_Generation","307719713_Efficient_object_localization_using_Convolutional_Networks","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","285976647_Comparison_of_Parametric_Representations_for_Monosyllabic_Word_Recognition_in_Continuously_Spoken_Sentences","272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","271854240_Embodied_Collaborative_Model_for_Referring_Expression_Generation_in_Situated_Human-Robot_Interaction","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","269722411_DeepSpeech_Scaling_up_end-to-end_speech_recognition"]}
