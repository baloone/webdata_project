{"id":"320369547_Quantizer_Design_for_Generalized_Locally-Optimum_Detectors_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"We tackle distributed detection of a non-cooperative (i.e. whose emitted power is unknown) target with a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). When the target is present, sensors observe an (unknown) randomly-fluctuating signal with attenuation depending on the distance between the sensor and the (unknown) target positions, embedded in Gaussian noise. The Fusion Center (FC) receives (only) sensor decisions through error-prone Binary Symmetric Channels (BSCs) and is in charge of performing a more-accurate global inference. The resulting test is one-sided with nuisance parameters (i.e. the target position) present only under the hypothesis H₁. To reduce the complexity of Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), a generalized locally-optimum detection test (based on Davies’ framework) is investigated and a corresponding sensor threshold optimization (based on a semi-theoretical criterion) is developed and verified through simulations.","authors":["Domenico Ciuonzo","Pierluigi Salvo Rossi"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Wireless Communication Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LWC.2017.2762305"],"references":["314605052_Generalized_Rao_Test_for_Decentralized_Detection_of_an_Uncooperative_Target","311736900_Distributed_Detection_of_a_Non-cooperative_Target_via_Generalized_Locally-optimum_Approaches","282513896_One-Bit_Quantization_and_Distributed_Detection_with_an_Unknown_Scale_Parameter","259212234_Decision_Fusion_With_Unknown_Sensor_Detection_Probability","230813581_Channel-Aware_Decision_Fusion_in_Distributed_MIMO_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Decode-and-Fuse_vs_Decode-then-Fuse","221933063_Distributed_Detection_and_Data_Fusion","261237122_Detection_of_a_non-cooperative_transmitter_in_Rayleigh_fading_with_binary_observations","258791958_One-Bit_Quantizer_Design_for_Multisensor_GLRT_Fusion","242624905_Fundamentals_of_Statistical_Signal_Processing_Vol_II_Detection_Theory","224699536_Joint_Detection_and_Localization_in_Sensor_Networks_Based_on_Local_Decisions"]}
