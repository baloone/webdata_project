{"id":"322651286_Brain_tumor_segmentation_in_multi-spectral_MRI_using_convolutional_neural_networks_CNN","abstract":"A tumor could be found in any area of the brain and could be of any size, shape, and contrast. There may exist multiple tumors of different types in a human brain at the same time. Accurate tumor area segmentation is considered primary step for treatment of brain tumors. Deep Learning is a set of promising techniques that could provide better results as compared to nondeep learning techniques for segmenting timorous part inside a brain. This article presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment brain tumors in MRIs. The proposed network uses BRATS segmentation challenge dataset which is composed of images obtained through four different modalities. Accordingly, we present an extended version of existing network to solve segmentation problem. The network architecture consists of multiple neural network layers connected in sequential order with the feeding of Convolutional feature maps at the peer level. Experimental results on BRATS 2015 benchmark data thus show the usability of the proposed approach and its superiority over the other approaches in this area of research.","authors":["Sajid Iqbal","Muhammad Usman Ghani Khan","Tanzila Saba","Amjad Rehman"],"meta":["January 2018Microscopy Research and Technique 81(10)","DOI:10.1002/jemt.22994"],"references":["320461853_Structural_Evaluation_for_Distribution_Networks_with_Distributed_Generation_Based_on_Complex_Network","320344644_Interactive_Medical_Image_Segmentation_Using_Deep_Learning_With_Image-Specific_Fine_Tuning","320220558_Computer-assisted_brain_tumor_type_discrimination_using_magnetic_resonance_imaging_features","318168153_Automatic_Brain_Tumor_Detection_and_Segmentation_Using_U-Net_Based_Fully_Convolutional_Networks","320460879_Fully_automated_segmentation_of_prostate_whole_gland_and_transition_zone_in_diffusion-weighted_MRI_using_convolutional_neural_networks","319501512_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","318360147_Generalised_Dice_overlap_as_a_deep_learning_loss_function_for_highly_unbalanced_segmentations","318168318_Evaluation_of_an_Automatic_ASPECT_Scoring_System_for_Acute_Stroke_in_Non-Contrast_CT","318140711_Fully_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Segmentation_of_the_Prostate_Gland_in_Diffusion-Weighted_MR_Images","318092072_Ear_biometrics_for_human_classification_based_on_region_features_mining"]}
