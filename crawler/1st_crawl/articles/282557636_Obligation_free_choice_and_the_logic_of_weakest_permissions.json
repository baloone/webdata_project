{"id":"282557636_Obligation_free_choice_and_the_logic_of_weakest_permissions","abstract":"We introduce a new understanding of deontic modals that we call\nobligations as weakest permissions\n. We argue for its philosophical plausibility, study its expressive power in neighborhood models, provide a complete Hilbert-style axiom system for it and show that it can be extended and applied to practical norms in decision and game theory.","authors":["Albert Anglberger","Norbert Gratzl","OLIVIER ROY"],"meta":["July 2015The Review of Symbolic Logic -1(4):1-21","DOI:10.1017/S1755020315000209"],"references":["266990431_Axioms_vs_Hypersequent_Rules_with_Context_Restrictions_Theory_and_Applications","264672351_Open_Reading_without_Free_Choice","258912389_A_systematics_of_deontic_action_logics_based_on_Boolean_algebra","233990266_A_Norm-giver_Meets_Deontic_Action_Logic","228811330_On_deontic_action_logics_based_on_Boolean_algebra","227001617_Free_Choice_Permission_is_Strong_Permission","346670872_Practical_Ethics","292782525_The_Logic_of_Best_Actions_from_a_Deontic_Perspective","267084951_Sequent_Calculi_for_Multi-modal_Logic_with_Interaction","266700065_Action_and_Deontology","259811114_Free_Choice_Permission","254897529_Minimal_Deontic_Logics","246869394_Moral_Conflict_and_Its_Structure","245773370_Consistency_in_Rationalist_Moral_Systems","243770768_A_Problem_About_Permission","242264807_Reasons_as_Defaults","238601234_Common_Reasoning_in_Games_A_Lewisian_Analysis_of_Common_Knowledge_of_Rationality","229487166_Stenius'_approach_to_disjunctive_permission","226943278_Regret_and_instability_in_causal_decision_theory","222670331_Action_negation_and_alternative_reductions_for_dynamic_deontic_logics","222515110_Intrinsic_Correlation_in_Games","222437972_Circumscription-A_Form_of_Non-Mon-otonic_Reasoning"]}
