{"id":"301528888_Beyond_Coverage_Toward_a_Bibliometrics_for_the_Humanities","abstract":"In this chapter, the possibility of using bibliometric measures for evaluating research in the humanities is pondered. A review of recent attempts to develop bibliometric methods for studying the humanities shows that organizational, epistemological differences as well as distinct research practices in research fields ought to be considered. The dependence on colleagues, interdisciplinarity and the ‘rural’ nature of research in many humanistic disciplines are identified as factors that influence the possibilities of applying bibliometric methods. A few particularly promising approaches are highlighted, and the possibility of developing a ‘bibliometrics for the humanities’ is examined. Finally, the intellectual characteristics of specific disciplines should be considered when quality indicators are constructed, and the importance of including scholars from the humanities in the process is stressed.","authors":["Björn Hammarfelt"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-29016-4_10","In book: Research Assessment in the Humanities (pp.115-131)"],"references":["284078906_A_performance_indicator_based_on_complete_data_for_the_scientific_publication_output_at_research_institutions","279553954_Assessing_the_Mendeley_readership_of_social_sciences_and_humanities_research","271919328_Using_altmetrics_for_assessing_research_impact_in_the_humanities","266620796_Disciplinary_differences_in_Twitter_scholarly_communication","291809211_The_death_of_the_scholarly_monograph_in_the_humanities_Citation_patterns_in_literary_scholarship","286958559_Characteristics_of_references_in_international_classification_systems_literature","270113262_Academic_Tribes_and_Territories_Intellectual_Enquiry_and_the_Cultures_of_Disciplines","269633767_Accountability_in_context_Effects_of_research_evaluation_systems_on_publication_practices_disciplinary_norms_and_individual_working_routines_in_the_faculty_of_Arts_at_Uppsala_University","264516065_Opportunities_for_and_Limitations_of_the_Book_Citation_Index","263682375_Harvesting_footnotes_in_a_rural_field_Citation_patterns_in_Swedish_literary_studies"]}
