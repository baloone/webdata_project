{"id":"262292459_Targeting_the_Fitts_Law","abstract":"Paul Fitts wrote the classic paper in 1954 that laid the foundations for one of the most successful laws in human-computer interaction. The Fitts Law guided users on the time taken to hit something, such as tapping a screen button. The law helped designers in making every interactive technology, ranging from iPhones to PCs, faster to use. The Accot and Zhai paper about the Fitts Law had a clever title that demonstrated the rules on letters. The Fitts Law continued to drive research, giving rise conflicting ideas and opinions. There were also several references to the incorrect Fitt's Law in the literature. MacKenzie's well-known paper was repeatedly cited in the literature as Fitt's law as a research and design tool in human-computer interaction. These problems could be avoided by using the compound noun form, as mentioned in the Fitts Law.","authors":["Harold Thimbleby"],"meta":["January 2013interactions 20(1):12-13","DOI:10.1145/2405716.2405720"],"references":["259609807_A_New_Test_of_Throughput_Invariance_in_Fitts'_Law_Role_of_the_Intercept_and_of_Jensen's_Inequality","234801527_Improving_text_entry_performance_for_Spanish-speaking_non-expert_and_impaired_users","2515900_More_than_dotting_the_i's_-_Foundations_for_crossing-based_interfaces","257482019_Action_graphs_and_user_performance_analysis","228351073_Information_Theoretic_Models_of_HCI_A_Comparison_of_the_Hick-Hyman_Law_and_Fitts'_Law","221097526_Extending_effective_target_width_in_Fitt's_law_to_two-dimensional_pointing_task","213799223_Fitts'_Law_as_a_Research_and_Design_Tool_in_Human-Computer_Interaction","21752413_The_Information_Capacity_of_the_Human_Motor_System_in_Controlling_the_Amplitude_of_Movement"]}
