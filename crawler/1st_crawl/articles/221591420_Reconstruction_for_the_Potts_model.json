{"id":"221591420_Reconstruction_for_the_Potts_model","abstract":"The reconstruction problem on the tree has been studied in numerous contexts including statistical physics, information theory and computational biology. However, rigorous reconstruction thresholds have only been established in a small number of models. We prove the first exact reconstruction threshold in a nonbinary model establishing the Kesten–Stigum bound for the 3-state Potts model on regular trees of large degree. We further establish that the Kesten–Stigum bound is not tight for the q-state Potts model when q ≥ 5. Moreover, we determine asymptotics for these reconstruction thresholds.","authors":["Allan Sly"],"meta":["January 2009The Annals of Probability 39(2011):581-590","DOI:10.1214/10-AOP584","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 41st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, STOC 2009, Bethesda, MD, USA, May 31 - June 2, 2009"],"references":["221591080_Optimal_phylogenetic_reconstruction","221498731_Randomly_Coloring_Constant_Degree_Graphs","24304845_Reconstruction_and_Clustering_in_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","24167497_A_Computational_Method_for_Bounding_the_Probability_of_Reconstruction_on_Trees","6268915_Gibbs_States_and_the_Set_of_Solutions_of_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","5915439_Phase_Transitions_in_the_Coloring_of_Random_Graphs","2392143_Broadcasting_on_Trees_and_the_Ising_Model","2108379_Glauber_Dynamics_on_Trees_and_Hyperbolic_Graphs","2099361_Information_flow_on_trees","1848720_Reconstruction_on_Trees_and_Spin_Glass_Transition","265669279_Convergence_of_Stochastic_Process","227701665_Fast_mixing_for_independent_sets_coloring_and_other_models_on_trees","226508411_On_the_Extremality_of_the_Disordered_State_for_the_Ising_Model_on_the_Bethe_Lattice","226205967_On_the_purity_of_limiting_Gibbs_state_for_the_Ising_model_on_the_Bethe_lattice","224678309_The_Kesten-Stigum_Reconstruction_Bound_Is_Tight_for_Roughly_Symmetric_Binary_Channels","222300178_On_the_Purity_of_the_free_boundary_condition_Potts_measure_on_random_trees_ArXiv08100677","220780162_Fast_mixing_for_independent_sets_colorings_and_other_models_on_trees","38365393_Additional_Limit_Theorems_for_Indecomposable_Multidimensional_Galton-Watson_Processes","38329907_A_mean_field_spin_glass_with_short-range_interactions","2387233_Reconstruction_on_Trees_Beating_the_Second_Eigenvalue","2113428_Survey_Information_flow_on_trees","2106819_Phase_Transitions_in_Phylogeny","1915177_Algorithmic_Barriers_from_Phase_Transitions","1912380_Reconstruction_of_Random_Colourings","1890418_On_the_Freezing_of_Variables_in_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","1887727_Reconstruction_for_Models_on_Random_Graphs","1756815_Gibbs_Rapidly_Samples_Colorings_of_Gndn"]}
