{"id":"324055874_Efficient_Interactive_Annotation_of_Segmentation_Datasets_with_Polygon-RNN","abstract":"Manually labeling datasets with object masks is extremely time consuming. In this work, we follow the idea of Polygon-RNN to produce polygonal annotations of objects interactively using humans-in-the-loop. We introduce several important improvements to the model: 1) we design a new CNN encoder architecture, 2) show how to effectively train the model with Reinforcement Learning, and 3) significantly increase the output resolution using a Graph Neural Network, allowing the model to accurately annotate high-resolution objects in images. Extensive evaluation on the Cityscapes dataset shows that our model, which we refer to as Polygon-RNN++, significantly outperforms the original model in both automatic (10% absolute and 16% relative improvement in mean IoU) and interactive modes (requiring 50% fewer clicks by annotators). We further analyze the cross-domain scenario in which our model is trained on one dataset, and used out of the box on datasets from varying domains. The results show that Polygon-RNN++ exhibits powerful generalization capabilities, achieving significant improvements over existing pixel-wise methods. Using simple online fine-tuning we further achieve a high reduction in annotation time for new datasets, moving a step closer towards an interactive annotation tool to be used in practice.","authors":["David Acuna","Huan Ling","Amlan Kar","Sanja Fidler"],"meta":["March 2018"],"references":["322060459_SGN_Sequential_Grouping_Networks_for_Instance_Segmentation","322060396_Mask_R-CNN","322058841_3D_Graph_Neural_Networks_for_RGBD_Semantic_Segmentation","322058819_TorontoCity_Seeing_the_World_with_a_Million_Eyes","320971443_Full-Resolution_Residual_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation_in_Street_Scenes","320971241_Annotating_Object_Instances_with_a_Polygon-RNN","320968206_Pyramid_Scene_Parsing_Network","319770420_Semantic_Image_Segmentation_with_Deep_Convolutional_Nets_and_Fully_Connected_CRFs","319770327_Multi-Scale_Context_Aggregation_by_Dilated_Convolutions","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks"]}
