{"id":"342541738_New_generalized_reverse_Minkowski_and_related_integral_inequalities_involving_generalized_fractional_conformable_integrals","abstract":"This paper gives some novel generalizations by considering the generalized conformable fractional integrals operator for reverse Minkowski type and reverse HÃ¶lder type inequalities. Furthermore, novel consequences connected with this inequality, together with statements and confirmation of various variants for the advocated generalized conformable fractional integral operator, are elaborated. Moreover, our derived results are provided to show comparisons of convergence between old and modified operators towards a function under different parameters and conditions. The numerical approximations of our consequence have several utilities in applied sciences and fractional integro-differential equations.","authors":["Saima Rashid","Ahmet Ocak Akdemir","Kottakkaran Sooppy Nisar","Thabet Abdeljawad"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Inequalities and Applications 2020(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13660-020-02445-2"],"references":["341044509_Some_New_Inequalities_Involving_k_-Fractional_Integral_for_Certain_Classes_of_Functions_and_Their_Applications","340960108_A_Note_on_Reverse_Minkowski_Inequality_via_Generalized_Proportional_Fractional_Integral_Operator_with_respect_to_Another_Function","340829225_On_Gruss_inequalities_within_generalized_K-fractional_integrals","340583675_A_New_Version_of_the_Hermite-Hadamard_Inequality_for_Riemann-Liouville_Fractional_Integrals","340136668_New_weighted_generalizations_for_differentiable_exponentially_convex_mapping_with_application","339900749_Ostrowski_type_inequalities_in_the_sense_of_generalized_K-fractional_integral_operator_for_exponentially_convex_functions","339569301_New_Investigation_on_the_Generalized_K-Fractional_Integral_Operators","339186229_Modification_of_certain_fractional_integral_inequalities_for_convex_functions","338709530_Delay_dynamic_double_integral_inequalities_on_time_scales_with_applications","344458077_Stability_analysis_and_numerical_simulation_of_fractional_order_HIVAIDS_model"]}
