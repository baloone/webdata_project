{"id":"348683742_Quantum-Computing-Inspired-Algorithms-in-Machine-Learning-RG","abstract":"In this chapter, the authors discuss the use of quantum computing concepts to optimize the decisionmaking\ncapability of classical machine learning algorithms. Machine learning, a subfield of artificial\nintelligence, implements various techniques to train a computer to learn and adapt to various real-time\ntasks. With the volume of data exponentially increasing, solving the same problems using classical algorithms\nbecomes more tedious and time consuming. Quantum computing has varied applications in many\nareas of computer science. One such area which has been transformed a lot through the introduction\nof quantum computing is machine learning. Quantum computing, with its ability to perform tasks in\nlogarithmic time, aids in overcoming the limitations of classical machine learning algorithms.","authors":["Deeksha Kaul","Harika Raju","B.K.
