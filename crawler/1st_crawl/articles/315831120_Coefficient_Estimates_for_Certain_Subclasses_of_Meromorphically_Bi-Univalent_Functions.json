{"id":"315831120_Coefficient_Estimates_for_Certain_Subclasses_of_Meromorphically_Bi-Univalent_Functions","abstract":"In the present investigation, we obtain the estimates on the initial Taylor-Maclaurin coefficients for functions in two new subclasses of meromorphically bi-univalent functions defined on the domain ∆ given by ∆ = {z : z ∈ C and 1 < |z| < ∞}. Several other closely-related earlier results are also indicated.","authors":["Hari Mohan Srivastava","S.B Joshi","Sayali S Joshi","Haridas Pawar"],"meta":["January 2016"],"references":["311976583_On_l-pseudo-starlike_functions","283097492_Coefficient_Bounds_for_a_Certain_Class_of_Analytic_and_Bi-Univalent_Functions","282317741_OEFFICIENT_BOUND_FOR_A_NEW_CLASS_OF_ANALYTIC_AND_BI-UNIVALENT_FUNCTIONS","265051200_COEFFICIENT_ESTIMATES_OF_MEROMORPHIC_BI-STARLIKE_FUNCTIONS_OF_COMPLEX_ORDER","262193800_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","260986777_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_class_of_meromorphic_bi-univalent_functions","258394567_Faber_Polynomial_Coefficient_Estimates_for_Meromorphic_Bi-Starlike_Functions","266049714_On_some_classes_of_bi-univalent_functions","265109585_On_a_Coefficient_Problem_for_Bi-Univalent_Functions","265051280_Coefficient_Estimates_of_Meromorphic_Bi-_Starlike_Functions_of_Complex_Order"]}
