We prove this via an extension of Kawarabayashi and Reed's result about parity-k-linked graphs (Combinatorica 29, 215–225). From this result, it is easy to deduce several other well-known results about the Erdős–Pósa property of odd cycles in highly connected graphs. This strengthens results due to Thomassen (Combinatorica 21, 321–333), and Rautenbach and Reed (Combinatorica 21, 267–278), respectively.","authors":["Felix Joos"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Graph Theory 85(4)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.22103"],"references":["269417196_Long_cycles_through_prescribed_vertices_have_the_ErdHos-P'osa_property","225978555_The_Erdos-Posa_Property_For_Long_Circuits","225417666_The_Erdos-Posa_Property_for_Odd_Cycles_in_Highly_Connected_Graphs","327014508_A_Unified_Erdos-Posa_Theorem_for_Constrained_Cycles","318237678_Long_cycles_through_prescribed_vertices_have_the_Erdos-Posa_property_BRUHN_et_al","269029198_On_the_maximal_number_of_disjoint_circuits_of_a_graph","265995772_On_the_minimal_number_of_vertices_representing_the_edges_of_a_graph","263343275_Half-integral_packing_of_odd_cycles_through_prescribed_vertices","256935637_Disjoint_cycles_intersecting_a_set_of_vertices","230344625_In_abstrakten_Graphen_vorhandene_vollstandige_4-Graphen_und_ihre_Untereilungen","225594529_Cycles_through_specified_vertices_of_a_graph","225540132_The_Erdos-Posa_Property_for_Odd_Cycles_in_Graphs_of_Large_Connectivity","225473510_Existenz_n-Fach_Zusammenhangender_Teilgraphen_in_Graphen_Genugend_Grosser_Kantendichte","222834126_On_the_odd-minor_variant_of_Hadwiger's_conjecture","222825116_Packing_cycles_through_prescribed_vertices","222559358_Non-zero_disjoint_cycles_in_highly_connected_group_labelled_graphs","222509237_Graph_minors_V_Excluding_a_planar_graph","220441736_Highly_parity_linked_graphs","220441445_Mangoes_and_Blueberries","2928374_An_Improved_Linear_Edge_Bound_for_Graph_Linkages"]}
