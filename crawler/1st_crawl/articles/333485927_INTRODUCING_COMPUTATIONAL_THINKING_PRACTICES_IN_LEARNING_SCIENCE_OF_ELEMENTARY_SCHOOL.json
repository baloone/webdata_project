{"id":"333485927_INTRODUCING_COMPUTATIONAL_THINKING_PRACTICES_IN_LEARNING_SCIENCE_OF_ELEMENTARY_SCHOOL","abstract":"Science is becoming a computational endeavor therefore Computational Thinking (CT) is gradually being accepted as a required skill for the 21st centu-ry science student. Students deserve relevant conceptual learning accessible through practical, constructionist approaches in cross-curricular applications therefore it is required for educators to define, practice and assess practical ways of introducing CT to science education starting from elementary school.","authors":["Gilad Shamir","Dina Tsybulsky","Ilya Levin"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.28945/4327","Conference: Proceeding of the Informing Science + Information Technology Education ConferenceAt: Jerusalem, Israel","Project: Science Education in Digital Society"],"references":["285208267_Interactive_Assessment_Tools_for_Computational_Thinking_in_High_School_STEM_Classrooms","284207908_Guest_Editorial_Exploring_the_Science_Framework_and_the_NGSS_Computational_Thinking_in_Elementary_School_Classrooms","283155060_Defining_Computational_Thinking_for_Mathematics_and_Science_Classrooms","258123665_Integrating_computational_thinking_with_K-12_science_education_using_agent-based_computation_A_theoretical_framework","257659783_Learning_Natural_Selection_in_4th_Grade_with_Multi-Agent-Based_Computational_Models","243618627_How_Do_Scientists_Think_Capturing_the_Dynamics_of_Conceptual_Change_in_Science","326840767_Coding_as_a_Playground_Programming_and_Computational_Thinking_in_the_Early_Childhood_Classroom","324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","312974828_Modeling_in_mathematics_and_science","282748526_Integrating_computational_thinking_across_the_K-8_curriculum"]}
