{"id":"324066687_Planning_chemical_syntheses_with_deep_neural_networks_and_symbolic_AI","abstract":"Computers teach themselves to make molecules\nChemical reaction databases that are automatically filled from the literature have made the planning of chemical syntheses, whereby target molecules are broken down into smaller and smaller building blocks, vastly easier over the past few decades. However, humans must still search these databases manually to find the best way to make a molecule. This involves many steps and choices. Some degree of automation has been achieved by encoding 'rules' of synthesis into computer programs, but this is time consuming owing to the numerous rules and subtleties involved. Here, Mark Waller and colleagues apply deep neural networks to plan chemical syntheses. They trained an algorithm on essentially every reaction published before 2015 so that it could learn the 'rules' itself and then predict synthetic routes to various small molecules not included in the training set. In blind testing, trained chemists could not distinguish between the solutions found by the algorithm and those taken from the literature.","authors":["Marwin H. S. Segler","Mike Preuss","Mark P.
