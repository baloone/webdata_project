{"id":"340107639_The_Limitations_of_Stylometry_for_Detecting_Machine-Generated_Fake_News","abstract":"Recent developments in neural language models (LMs) have raised concerns about their potential misuse for automatically spreading misinformation. In light of these concerns, several studies have proposed to detect machine-generated fake news by capturing their stylistic differences from human-written text. These approaches, broadly termed stylometry, have found success in source attribution and misinformation detection in human-written texts. However, in this work, we show that stylometry is limited against machine-generated misinformation. Whereas humans speak differently when trying to deceive, LMs generate stylistically consistent text, regardless of underlying motive. Thus, though stylometry can successfully prevent impersonation by identifying text provenance, it fails to distinguish legitimate LM applications from those that introduce false information. We create two benchmarks demonstrating the stylistic similarity between\nmalicious and legitimate uses of LMs, utilized in auto-completion and editing-assistance settings. 1","authors":["Tal Schuster","Roei Schuster","Darsh J Shah","Regina Barzilay"],"meta":["March 2020Computational Linguistics 46(302):1-18","DOI:10.1162/COLI_a_00380"],"references":["339031969_INFORMATION_DISORDER_Toward_an_interdisciplinary_framework_for_research_and_policy_making_Information_Disorder_Toward_an_interdisciplinary_framework_for_research_and_policymaking","336998946_MultiFC_A_Real-World_Multi-Domain_Dataset_for_Evidence-Based_Fact_Checking_of_Claims","335778843_The_Language_of_Legal_and_Illegal_Activity_on_the_Darknet","336996961_Evaluating_adversarial_attacks_against_multiple_fact_verification_systems","336995731_Towards_Debiasing_Fact_Verification_Models","335781128_GLTR_Statistical_Detection_and_Visualization_of_Generated_Text","335517139_Automatic_Detection_of_Fake_News","334118103_The_Fact_Extraction_and_VERification_FEVER_Shared_Task","334115090_DeClarE_Debunking_Fake_News_and_False_Claims_using_Evidence-Aware_Deep_Learning","334115084_A_Stylometric_Inquiry_into_Hyperpartisan_and_Fake_News"]}
