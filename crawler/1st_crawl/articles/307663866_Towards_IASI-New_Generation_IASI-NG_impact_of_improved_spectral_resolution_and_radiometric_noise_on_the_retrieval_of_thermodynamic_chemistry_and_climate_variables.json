The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument\ndeveloped by the French space agency (CNES) and launched by EUMETSAT onboard\nthe Metop satellite series is providing essential inputs for weather\nforecasting and pollution/climate monitoring owing to its smart combination\nof large horizontal swath, good spectral resolution and high radiometric\nperformance. EUMETSAT is currently preparing the next polar-orbiting program\n(EPS-SG) with the Metop-SG satellite series that should be launched around\n2020. In this framework, CNES is studying the concept of a new instrument,\nthe IASI-New Generation (IASI-NG), characterized by an improvement of both\nspectral and radiometric characteristics as compared to IASI, with three\nobjectives: (i) continuity of the IASI/Metop series; (ii) improvement of\nvertical resolution; and (iii) improvement of the accuracy and detection\nthreshold for atmospheric and surface components. In this paper, we show\nthat an improvement of spectral resolution and radiometric noise fulfil\nthese objectives by leading to (i) a better vertical coverage in the lower\npart of the troposphere, thanks to the increase in spectral resolution; and (ii)\nan increase in the accuracy of the retrieval of several thermodynamic,\nclimate and chemistry variables, thanks to the improved signal-to-noise\nratio as well as less interference between the signatures of the absorbing\nspecies in the measured radiances. The detection limit of several\natmospheric species is also improved. We conclude that IASI-NG has the\npotential to strongly benefit the numerical weather prediction,\nchemistry and climate communities now connected through the European\nGMES/Copernicus initiative.","authors":["C.
