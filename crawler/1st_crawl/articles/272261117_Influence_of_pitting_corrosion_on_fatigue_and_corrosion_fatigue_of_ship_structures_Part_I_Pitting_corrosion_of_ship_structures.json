Mechanisms of a shortand long-term pitting corrosion in marine environment have been described including pit nucleation and growth phases. Some models of pit growth versus time of exposure have been presented. Some factors which influence the pit growth rate have been discussed briefly","authors":["Marek Jakubowski"],"meta":["January 2013Polish Maritime Research 21(1)","DOI:10.2478/pomr-2014-0009"],"references":["289945617_Pitting_corrosion_model_of_mild_and_low-alloy_steel_in_marine_environment_-_Part_2_The_shape_of_corrosion_pits","317855812_21101_Tensile_Strength_of_Hull_Structural_Members_with_Pitting_Corrosion","315150113_Fatigue_Strength_of_Corroded_Weld_Joints","298883729_The_effect_of_pitting_corrosion_on_fatigue_life","297126119_Fatigue_strength_of_coated_steel_plate_in_seawater","288295322_Simplified_maximum_pit_depth_model_of_mild_and_low_alloy_steels_in_marine_immersion_environments","275937942_A_Study_on_Static_Strength_of_Corroded_Fillet_Welded_Joints_for_Ship_Structures","274675097_Passivity_Breakdown_of_Mild_Steel_in_Sea_Water_in_the_Presence_of_Sulfate_Reducing_Bacteria","271393359_Effect_of_Corrosion_and_its_Protection_on_Hull_Strength_1st_Report","267603759_Pitting_Corrosion_and_Its_Influence_on_Local_Strength_of_Hull_Structural_Members"]}
