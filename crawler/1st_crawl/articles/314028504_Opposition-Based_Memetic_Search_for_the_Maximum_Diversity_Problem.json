{"id":"314028504_Opposition-Based_Memetic_Search_for_the_Maximum_Diversity_Problem","abstract":"As a usual model for a variety of practical applications, the maximum diversity problem (MDP) is computational challenging. In this paper, we present an opposition-based memetic algorithm (OBMA) for solving MDP, which integrates the concept of opposition-based learning (OBL) into the wellknown memetic search framework. OBMA explores both candidate solutions and their opposite solutions during its initialization and evolution processes. Combined with a powerful local optimization procedure and a rank-based quality-and-distance pool updating strategy, OBMA establishes a suitable balance between exploration and exploitation of its search process. Computational results on 80 popular MDP benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm matches the best-known solutions for most of instances, and finds improved best solutions (new lower bounds) for 22 instances. We provide experimental evidences to highlight the beneficial effect of opposition-based learning for solving MDP.","authors":["Yangming Zhou","Jin-Kao Hao","Beatrice Duval"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE transactions on neural networks / a publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council 21(5):731-745","DOI:10.1109/TEVC.2017.2674800"],"references":["301899345_Reinforcement_learning_based_local_search_for_grouping_problems_A_case_study_on_graph_coloring","299416769_Memetic_Search_for_the_Generalized_Quadratic_Multiple_Knapsack_Problem","283187518_Opposition-Based_Magnetic_Optimization_Algorithm_With_Parameter_Adaptation_Strategy","280688578_A_hybrid_metaheuristic_method_for_the_Maximum_Diversity_Problem","267475401_Heuristic_algorithms_for_the_maximum_diversity_problem","267125000_Optimal_results_and_tight_bounds_for_the_Maximum_Diversity_Problem","265413756_Understanding_the_Empirical_Hardness_of_NP-Complete_Problems","313629838_A_template_for_scatter_search_and_path_relinking","308805057_Using_association_rules_to_guide_evolutionary_search_in_solving_constraint_satisfaction","281748844_Partition-distance_A_problem_and_class_of_perfect_graphs_arising_in_clustering"]}
