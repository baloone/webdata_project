{"id":"243698150_Intelligence_and_Cooperation_in_Heterarchic_Manufacturing_Systems","abstract":"During the past 30 years, our thinking about complex computer-controlled system has been conditioned by the concepts of hierarchic structures. Recent advances in distributed computing power and open system architectures (particularly local-area networks) have opened the way for heterarchic structures. Based on incomplete and non-algorithmic architecture specifications, these systems will have to exercise a high degree of local intelligence to cope with unforeseen situations. The distribution of information and of decision-making powers requires the development of new architectural tools to achieve cooperation between functions and the emergency transfer of functions. New modes of man-machine synergy and new synthesis methods for such systems are also necessary.","authors":["J.
