{"id":"235584084_Spin-flip_excitations_spin_waves_and_magnetoexcitons_in_graphene_Landau_levels_at_integer_filling_factors","abstract":"We study collective electronic excitations in graphene in the integer quantum-Hall regime, concentrating mainly on excitations with spin reversal such as spin-flip and spin-wave excitations. We show that these excitations are correctly accounted for in the time-dependent Hartree-Fock and strong magnetic field approximations, in contrast to spin-conserving (magnetoexciton) modes which involve a strong Landau-level mixing at nonzero wave vectors. The collective excitations are discussed in view of prominent theorems, such as Kohn’s and Larmor’s. Whereas the latter remains valid in graphene and yields insight into the understanding of spin-dependent modes, Kohn’s theorem does not apply to relativistic electrons in graphene. We finally calculate the exchange correction to the chemical potential in the weak magnetic field limit.","authors":["R. Roldán","J.-N. Fuchs","M. O. Goerbig"],"meta":["November 2010Physical review.
