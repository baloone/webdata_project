{"id":"328612102_Making_Learning_Materials_Accessible_in_Higher_Education-Attitudes_Among_Technology_Faculty_Members","abstract":"With the increasing popularity of digital technologies, more and more digital learning materials are available in education. However, making digital learning materials accessible to diverse students can be a challenging task. In higher education institutions, faculty members play a vital role in ensuring the accessibility of digital learning materials. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the attitudes among faculty members towards this task by conducting a thematic analysis of 35 semi-structured interviews with computer science and engineering faculty members at four universities in Norway and Poland.","authors":["Weiqin Chen","Norun C Sanderson","Siri Kessel"],"meta":["January 2018Studies in Health Technology and Informatics 256:87-97"],"references":["290395915_Assessing_Faculty_Attitudes_toward_Universal_Design_Instructional_Techniques","273828466_Measuring_university_faculty_attitudes_toward_disability_Willingness_to_accommodate_and_adopt_Universal_Design_principles","263046112_University_faculty_attitudes_toward_disability_and_inclusive_instruction_Comparing_two_institutions","323207780_'We_are_just_ordinary_people_working_hard_to_reach_our_goals'_Disabled_students'_participation_in_Norwegian_higher_education","316953445_Universal_Design_for_Instruction_and_Learning_A_Pilot_Study_of_Faculty_Instructional_Methods_and_Attitudes_Related_to_Students_with_Disabilities_in_Higher_Education","297657618_Inclusion_of_Students_with_Disabilities_in_Higher_Education_Performance_and_participation_in_student's_experiences","297657010_Disability_and_eLearning_Opportunities_and_Barriers","277849189_Students_with_Disabilities_at_Degree-Granting_Postsecondary_Institutions_First_Look_NCES_2011-018","258166645_Associations_between_Prior_Disability-Focused_Training_and_Disability-Related_Attitudes_and_Perceptions_among_University_Faculty","257946502_Universal_design_for_learning_in_postsecondary_education_Reflections_on_principles_and_their_application"]}
