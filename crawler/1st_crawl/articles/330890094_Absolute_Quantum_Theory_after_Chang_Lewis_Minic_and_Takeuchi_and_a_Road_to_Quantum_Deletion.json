{"id":"330890094_Absolute_Quantum_Theory_after_Chang_Lewis_Minic_and_Takeuchi_and_a_Road_to_Quantum_Deletion","abstract":"In a recent paper, Chang et al. have proposed studying “quantum F u n ”: the q ↦ 1 limit of modal quantum theories over finite fields F q , motivated by the fact that such limit theories can be naturally interpreted in classical quantum theory. In this letter, we first make a number of rectifications of statements made in that paper. For instance, we show that quantum theory over F 1 does have a natural analogon of an inner product, and so orthogonality is a well-defined notion, contrary to what was claimed in Chang et al. Starting from that formalism, we introduce time evolution operators and observables in quantum F u n , and we determine the corresponding unitary group. Next, we obtain a typical no-cloning result in the general realm of quantum F u n . Finally, we obtain a no-deletion result as well. Remarkably, we show that we can perform quantum deletion by almost unitary operators, with a probability tending to 1. Although we develop the construction in quantum F u n , it is also valid in any other quantum theory (and thus also in classical quantum theory in complex Hilbert spaces).","authors":["Koen Thas"],"meta":["February 2019Symmetry 11(2):174","DOI:10.3390/sym11020174"],"references":["259312606_Quantum_F_un_the_q1_Limit_of_Galois_Field_Quantum_Mechanics_Projective_Geometry_and_the_Field_with_One_Element","329275317_Projective_spaces_over_F1l_THAS","285331549_A_set_of_assumptions_for_projective_geometry","266551983_Points_and_lines_Characterizing_the_classical_geometries","265374085_Projective_Geometries_Over_Finite_Fields","263316523_The_combinatorial-motivic_nature_of_mathbbF_1-schemes","255946444_The_no-cloning_theorem","234083279_Optimal_Information_Transfer_and_Real-Vector-Space_Quantum_Theory","232253026_Real-Vector-Space_Quantum_Theory_with_a_Universal_Quantum_Bit","228109669_A_Single_Quantum_Cannot_be_Cloned","225090800_Spin_and_Rotations_in_Galois_Field_Quantum_Mechanics","225045184_Galois_Field_Quantum_Mechanics","47663308_Introduction_to_A_Quantum_Theory_over_A_Galois_Field","47405394_Modal_Quantum_Theory","222459031_Communication_by_EPR_devices"]}
