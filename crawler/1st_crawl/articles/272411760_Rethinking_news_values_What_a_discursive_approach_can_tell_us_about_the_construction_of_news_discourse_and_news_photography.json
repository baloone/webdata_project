{"id":"272411760_Rethinking_news_values_What_a_discursive_approach_can_tell_us_about_the_construction_of_news_discourse_and_news_photography","abstract":"The study of news values/factors has a long and rich history in journalism and communications research. Conceptually, they encompass not only the newsworthy aspects of happenings or news actors but also external aspects that impact journalism practice, such as the influence of proprietors or advertisers, meeting deadlines or competition among news providers to get exclusive stories. Some view news values as existing in the actual events and people who are reported on in the news, that is, in events in their material reality (a material perspective). Others conceive news values as existing in the minds of journalists (a cognitive perspective). News values are also constructed in the discourses involved in the production of news (a discursive perspective). The focus in this article is on this third perspective, with the aim of demonstrating what a discursive approach to news values can add to the two other, theoretical and analytical perspectives. The article has an additional focus on the much neglected area of visual analysis and investigates the construction of news values in news photography.","authors":["Helen Caple","Monika Bednarek"],"meta":["February 2015Journalism 17(4)","DOI:10.1177/1464884914568078"],"references":["330115028_Reading_Images-The_Grammar_of_Visual_Design","314199692_Journalistic_and_Commercial_News_Values","274993360_From_Grexit_to_Grecovery_Eurocrisis_discourses","263534281_DETERMINANTS_OF_NEWS_CONTENT","249939823_Predicting_news_decisions_An_empirical_test_of_the_two-component_theory_of_news_selection","242189101_Journalistic_and_Commercial_News_Values_News_Organizations_as_Patrons_of_an_Institution_and_Market_Actors","241732323_What_Is_News_Galtung_and_Ruge_Revisited","238431199_The_Structure_of_Foreign_News","349916834_Power_Without_Responsibility_Press_Broadcasting_and_the_Internet_in_Britain","318471047_Evaluation_in_media_discourse_Analysis_of_a_newspaper_corpus","316648564_Multimodality_and_Genre_A_Foundation_for_the_Systematic_Analysis_of_Multimodal_Documents","316159893_Photojournalism_A_Social_Semiotic_Approach","307981806_When_war_is_reduced_to_a_photograph","299534502_The_Language_of_Evaluation_Appraisal_in_English","289641931_Introduction_Evaluation_and_stance_in_war_news","283654115_News_media","277815731_Corpus-assisted_discourse_studies_on_the_Iraq_conflict_Wording_the_war","277815011_Discourse_and_Practice_New_Tools_for_Critical_Analysis","274993186_Why_do_news_values_matter_Towards_a_new_methodological_framework_for_analysing_news_discourse_in_Critical_Discourse_Analysis_and_beyond","274305563_Selection_and_impact_of_press_photography_An_empirical_study_on_the_basis_of_photo_news_factors","273545823_Journalists_at_Work_Specialist_Correspondents_Their_News_Organizations_News_Sources_Competitor-Colleagues","270150651_The_Language_of_News_Media","258155092_Factors_Influencing_the_Flow_of_News","258153939_Deviant_Acts_Risky_Business_and_US_Interests_The_Newsworthiness_of_World_Events","251446912_Celebrities_in_Action_and_Other_News_News_Factors_of_German_TV_news_1992_-_2004_Results_From_a_Content_Analysis","249713081_Introduction_Approaches_to_Tragedy","249689854_Psychology_of_News_DecisionsFactors_behind_Journalists'_Professional_Behavior","249682681_Determinants_of_International_News_Coverage_in_the_US_Media","249671480_Newspaper_design_as_cultural_change","247833640_The_determinations_of_news_photographs","245517786_News_Structure_and_People's_Awareness_of_Political_Events","240753315_News_factors_and_news_decisions_Theoretical_and_methodological_advances_in_Germany","240730091_Playing_with_environmental_stories_in_the_news_-_good_or_bad_practice","238687639_A_system_for_image-text_relations_in_new_and_old_media","238432160_Foreign_News_News_Values_and_Ideologies","235362356_Manufacturing_Consent_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media","234563798_News_Values_in_Award-Winning_Photos","233084669_News_values_of_sports_events_An_application_of_a_newsworthiness_model_on_the_World_Cup_coverage_of_US_and_Korean_media","227756531_Deconstructing_the_Diversity_Principle","36812075_Power_Without_Responsibility_The_Press_and_Broadcasting_in_Britain","32117398_News_Values","30387064_Asian_journalists_seek_values_worth_preserving","27650874_Introducing_Social_Semiotics","27477154_Media_fundamentalism_the_immediate_response_of_the_UK_national_press_to_September_11"]}
