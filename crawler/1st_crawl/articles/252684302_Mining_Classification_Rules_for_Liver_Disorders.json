{"id":"252684302_Mining_Classification_Rules_for_Liver_Disorders","abstract":"Abstract— Nowadays ,data mining ,is a ,very popular technique and has been successfully applied inmedical,area. Classification is aessential,approach ,in data ,mining. One of the ,classification methods,is a ArtificialNeural Networks. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) generally achieve high accuracy of classification. However, knowledge,acquired ,by ANN ,is incomprehensible for humans. This fact is causing a serious problem,in data mining,applications. The rules that are derived from ANN are needed ,to be ,formed ,to solve this problem ,and various methods ,have been improved ,to extract these rules. Selection of the activation function is important inthe,performance ,of ANN. Networks with adaptive activation function seem ,to provide ,better fitting properties than classical architectures with fixed activation function ,neurons ,[1]. In this study, first neural network has been trained with adaptive activation function. Then for the purpose ,of extracting rules from adaptive ANN which has been trained for classification, OptaiNET that is an Artificial Immune,Algorithm (AIS) has been used and a set of rules has been formed for liver disorder. Keywords—Adaptive Neural Networks, Artificial Immune Systems, Rule Extraction, Liver Disorders.","authors":["Humar Kahramanli","Novruz Allahverdi"],"meta":["January 2009International Journal of Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 3(1)","Project: Applications of Fuzzy Approach in Medicine.
