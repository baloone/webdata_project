{"id":"276083687_Asymptotic_Properties_of_Protected_Nodes_in_Random_Recursive_Trees","abstract":"We investigate protected nodes in random recursive trees. The exact mean of the number of such nodes is obtained by recurrence, and a linear asymptotic equivalent follows. A nonlinear recurrence for the variance shows that the variance grows linearly, too. It follows that the number of protected nodes in a random recursive tree, upon proper scaling, converges in probability to a constant.","authors":["Hosam M.
