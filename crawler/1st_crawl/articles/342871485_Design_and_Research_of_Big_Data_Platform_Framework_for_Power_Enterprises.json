{"id":"342871485_Design_and_Research_of_Big_Data_Platform_Framework_for_Power_Enterprises","abstract":"Big data technology is one of the most fashionable computer science and technology. Through the rational use of big data technology, traditional enterprises can accelerate the promotion and transformation of business informatization and intelligence. After long-term accumulation and precipitation, the power industry has accumulated a large number of structured and unstructured data of production, operation and management. Based on the actual demand of the electric power industry and the characteristics of the existing information system and mass data, this paper studied the big data platform framework system of electric power enterprises, and carried out the big data framework design from the overall architecture, technical architecture, data architecture, logical deployment architecture and other aspects. The overall design idea conforms to the development concept of “big data +\" and “Internet +\", and has a good technical foundation and application support, which can be widely used in the design and construction of power big data platform.","authors":["Rui Ma","Weibing Li","Nengwu Ma","Xiong Zhang"],"meta":["July 2020IOP Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science 529(1):012009","DOI:10.1088/1755-1315/529/1/012009"],"references":["303575700_Towards_Geo-spatial_Information_Science_in_Big_Data_Era"]}
