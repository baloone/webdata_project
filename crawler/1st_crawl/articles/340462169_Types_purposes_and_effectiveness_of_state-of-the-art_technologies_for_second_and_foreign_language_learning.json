{"id":"340462169_Types_purposes_and_effectiveness_of_state-of-the-art_technologies_for_second_and_foreign_language_learning","abstract":"Digital technologies have been widely used to enhance language learning, the effectiveness of which has been acknowledged in the literature. With the rapid development of digital devices and technologies, increasing technologies have been used in the most recent several years, leading to more diversified approaches to language education. This exceptional advance over the past few years calls for a summary of state-of-the-art technologies that have been used to enhance language learning and promote effective learning. The present study was conducted to fill this gap by reviewing all the relevant publications in 10 widely recognised journals in the field of technology-enhanced language learning. An analysis of 57 articles indicated five major types of technology for second and foreign language learning (i.e. technologies for mobile learning, multimedia learning and socialisation, speech-to-text and text-to-speech recognition, and digital-game-based learning). The results also showed four primary purposes and benefits of the state-of-the-art technologies: promoting practices, delivering instructional content, facilitating interactions, and restructuring teaching approaches. Moreover, these state-of-the-art technologies have been integrated into various aspects of language teaching and learning, the overall impact of which has been positive.","authors":["Ruofei Zhang","Di
