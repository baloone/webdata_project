{"id":"322015237_Neither_Completely_M-_Nor_E-_Learning_Integrating_both_is_the_Solution","abstract":"The rapid growth in technology and communication has a massive effect in all domains, including the education sector. The teaching paradigms were evolved from traditional face-to-face and distance learning to e-learning, open learning and recently m-learning. This paper spots the light on e-learning and m-learning, on specific, the common and different features between both. In addition the paper investigates the students' opinions at arab open university about moving completely from e-leaning towards m-learning or integrating both paradigms. Results reveal that students prefer integrating both paradigms to get benefit from both technologies and not to be restricted to some m-learning constraints such as the small size of screen, font, keypad buttons, and the limited storage capabilities.","authors":["Bayan Abu Shawar"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1145/3141128.3141144","Conference: the 2017 International Conference"],"references":["257716228_Is_M-learning_Versus_E-learning_or_are_They_Supporting_Each_Other","251285782_Effects_of_Information_Distributions_Strategies_on_Student_Performance_and_Satisfaction_in_a_Web-Based_Course_Management_System","250715030_A_Framework_for_Assessing_the_Quality_of_Mobile_Learning","228713176_Introducing_attribute_certificates_to_secure_distributed_E-learning_or_M-learning_services","228649793_Designing_learning_services_for_open_learning_systems_utilizing_IMS_learning_design","228419183_Learning_Management_System_and_its_Relationship_with_Knowledge_Management","220374785_Defining_Mobile_Learning_in_the_Higher_Education_Landscape","26468172_Defining_Discussing_and_Evaluating_Mobile_Learning_The_moving_finger_writes_and_having_writ","265288633_On-Line_Course_Effectiveness_An_Analysis_of_Student_Interactions_and_Perceptions_of_Learning","265092376_Educating_the_Net_Generation","257926027_Mobile_Learning_Transforming_the_Delivery_of_Education_and_Training","234660106_Using_Online_Learning_To_Meet_Workforce_Demand_A_Case_Study_of_Stakeholder_Influence","228698646_Educating_the_Net_Generation","228412876_Web_services_architecture_for_m-learning","222525217_Factors_affecting_engineers'_acceptance_of_asynchronous_e-learning_system_in_high-tech_companies","220942775_Quality_Assurance_and_Control_Model_for_E-Learning","220374411_A_theory_for_eLearning","42792151_Mobile_Learning_A_Handbook_for_Educators_and_Trainers","35319895_Long_distance_learning"]}
