{"id":"349230649_Synchronous_Mobility_Analysis_for_Institutional_Evaluationyanjiujiguanpingsinotamenotongshidenayanjiuzheyidongnofenxishoufa","abstract":"Organizational mobility of researchers plays an important role in knowledge diffusion and intellectual exchange in open science. In recent years, the impact of researcher mobility on creativity has been studied extensively, and it has been found that mobility has a positive effect on researchers both domestically and internationally, but what aspects of mobility contribute to researcher creativity remains unclear. In this research, we propose a method to analyze the bibliographic information of synchronous mobility,focusing on the simultaneous affiliation of researchers, which has recently been attracting attention in the field of computer science where migration is active. We compare synchronous mobilities with the case of a researcher who completely changes his or her organization, and discuss how the simultaneous acquisition of researchers functions as an organizational strategy in open science.","authors":["Takahiro Miura","Kimitaka ASATANI","Ichiro Sakata"],"meta":["January 2021Joho Chishiki Gakkaishi 30(4):467-470","DOI:10.2964/jsik_2021_010"],"references":["342990931_Cities_and_countries_in_the_global_scientist_mobility_network","327886798_Multiscale_impact_of_researcher_mobility","277351392_Accuracy_evaluation_of_Scopus_Author_ID_based_on_the_largest_funding_database_in_Japan"]}
