{"id":"327390895_Neutrosophic_Approach_to_Grayscale_Images_Domain","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new technique for the enhancing images. It will work on removing the noise contained in the image as well as improving its contrast based on three different enhancing transforms, we commence by embedding the image into a neutrosophic domain; where the image will be mapped in three different levels, a level of trueness, a level of falseness and a level of indeterminacy. Hence, we act separately on each level using the enhancement transforms. Finally, we introduce a new analysis in the field of analysis and processing of images using the neutrosophic crisp set theory via Mat lab program where has been obtained three images, which helps in a new analysis to improve and retrieve images. ranches of neutrosophic mathematics, as an extension of the concept of the fuzzy set theory introduced by Zadeh [25].","authors":["A.
