{"id":"3418989_MOEAD_A_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition","abstract":"Decomposition is a basic strategy in traditional multiobjective optimization. However, it has not yet been widely used in multiobjective evolutionary optimization. This paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and optimizes them simultaneously. Each subproblem is optimized by only using information from its several neighboring subproblems, which makes MOEA/D have lower computational complexity at each generation than MOGLS and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Experimental results have demonstrated that MOEA/D with simple decomposition methods outperforms or performs similarly to MOGLS and NSGA-II on multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problems and continuous multiobjective optimization problems. It has been shown that MOEA/D using objective normalization can deal with disparately-scaled objectives, and MOEA/D with an advanced decomposition method can generate a set of very evenly distributed solutions for 3-objective test instances. The ability of MOEA/D with small population, the scalability and sensitivity of MOEA/D have also been experimentally investigated in this paper.","authors":["Qingfu Zhang","Hui Li"],"meta":["January 2008IEEE transactions on neural networks / a publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council 11(6):712 - 731","DOI:10.1109/TEVC.2007.892759","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["316799364_Genetic_Algorithms_and_Evolutionary_Computation","303432344_Multicriteria_Optimization","302560124_A_fast_elitist_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II","299038134_Specification_of_genetic_search_directions_in_cellular_multi-objective_genetic_algorithms","284650886_An_updated_survey_of_GA-based_multiobjective_optimization","272929205_Nonlinear_Multiobjective_Optimization","270372091_Multiple_Criteria_Decision_Making","268539852_On_the_Approximation_of_Solutions_to_Multiple_Criteria_Decision_Making_Problems","266476598_Multi-Objective_Optimization_Using_Evolutionary_Algorithms","265505614_Multiple_criteria_optimization_theory_computation_and_application_Reprint_with_corr_of_the_orig_publ_by_Wiley_1986"]}
