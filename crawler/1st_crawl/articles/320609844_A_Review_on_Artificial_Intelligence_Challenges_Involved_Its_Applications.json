AI artificial intelligence is the imitation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. These processes comprise learning, reasoning and self-correction. Artificial Intelligence is becoming a trendy field in computer science because it has improved the human life in a lot of areas. Artificial intelligence has significantly enhanced the performance of the manufacturing and service systems in the last two decades. Study in the area of artificial intelligence has given ascend to the swiftly rising technology known as expert system. Application areas of Artificial Intelligence is having a massive impact on different fields of life as expert system is extensively used these days to crack the complex problems in various areas such as science, engineering, business, medicine & weather forecasting. The areas using the technology of Artificial Intelligence have seen a boost in the quality and efficiency. This paper presents an outline of this technology and the application areas of this technology.","authors":["Gagan Pabby","Neeraj Kumar"],"meta":["October 2017"],"references":["319178767_Challenges_Involved_in_Big_Data_Processing_Methods_to_Solve_Big_Data_Processing_Problems","303850262_Offline_Handwritten_Gurmukhi_Character_Recognition_A_Review","271207614_DESIGN_AND_DEVELOPMENT_OF_RFID_BASED_INTELLIGENT_SECURITY_SYSTEM"]}
