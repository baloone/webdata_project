{"id":"334286709_A_Lower_Bound_of_Fast_Algebraic_Immunity_of_A_Class_of_1-Resilient_Boolean_Functions","abstract":"Boolean functions should possess high fast algebraic immunity when used in stream ciphers in order to stand up to fast algebraic attacks. However, in previous research, the fast algebraic immunity of Boolean functions was usually calculated by computer. In 2017, Tang, Carlet and Tang first mathematically proved that every function belonging to a class of 1-resilient Boolean functions has fast algebraic immunity no less than n-6. Inspired by Tangâ€™s method, we also demonstrate that the fast algebraic immunity of another class of 1-resilient Boolean functions is no less than n-6. Meanwhile, we also prove some combinator facts originated from Tu-Deng Conjecture.","authors":["Yindong Chen","Liu Zhang","Jianlong Xu","Weihong Cai"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926765"],"references":["333831073_Fast_Algebraic_Immunity_of_2m2_2m3_Variables_Majority_Function","333546372_Balanced_Odd-Variable_RSBFs_with_Optimum_AI_High_Nonlinearity_and_Good_Behavior_against_FAAs","332129931_Translation_Equivalence_of_Boolean_Functions_Expressed_by_Primitive_Element","331910345_Constructing_odd-variable_RSBFs_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_good_nonlinearity_and_good_behavior_against_fast_algebraic_attacks","331746791_A_new_construction_of_rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_and_higher_nonlinearity","330526127_One_Note_About_the_Tu-Deng_Conjecture_in_Case_wt_5","318376303_Construction_of_Highly_Nonlinear_1-Resilient_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Provably_High_Fast_Algebraic_Immunity","309603543_The_Exact_Fast_Algebraic_Immunity_of_Two_Subclasses_of_the_Majority_Function","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","280212584_A_class_of_1-resilient_boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_and_good_behavior_against_fast_algebraic_attacks"]}
