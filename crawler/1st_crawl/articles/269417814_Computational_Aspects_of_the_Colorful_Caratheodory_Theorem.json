{"id":"269417814_Computational_Aspects_of_the_Colorful_Caratheodory_Theorem","abstract":"Let $P_1,...,P_{d+1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ be $d$-dimensional point sets such\nthat the convex hull of each $P_i$ contains the origin. We call the sets $P_i$\ncolor classes, and we think of the points in $P_i$ as having color $i$. A\ncolorful choice is a set with at most one point of each color. The colorful\nCaratheodory theorem guarantees the existence of a colorful choice whose convex\nhull contains the origin. So far, the computational complexity of finding such\na colorful choice is unknown.\nWe approach this problem from two directions. First, we consider\napproximation algorithms: an $m$-colorful choice is a set that contains at most\n$m$ points from each color class. We show that for any constant $\\varepsilon >\n0$, an $\\lceil \\varepsilon(d+1)\\rceil$-colorful choice containing the origin in\nits convex hull can be found in polynomial time. This notion of approximation\nhas not been studied before, and it is motivated through the applications of\nthe colorful Caratheodory theorem in the literature. In the second part, we\npresent a natural generalization of the colorful Caratheodory problem: in the\nNearest Colorful Polytope problem (NCP), we are given sets $P_1,...,P_n \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^d$ that do not necessarily contain the origin in their convex hulls.\nThe goal is to find a colorful choice whose convex hull minimizes the distance\nto the origin. We show that computing local optima for the NCP problem is\nPLS-complete, while computing a global optimum is NP-hard.","authors":["Wolfgang Mulzer","Yannik Stein"],"meta":["October 2018Discrete & Computational Geometry 60(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-018-9979-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["244954707_A_Generalization_of_Radon's_Theorem","235694479_Very_Colorful_Theorems","313759587_Fast_algorithms_for_convex_quadratic_programming_and_multicommodity_flows","312252363_The_Rainbow_at_the_End_of_the_Line_-_A_PPAD_Formulation_of_the_Colorful_Caratheodory_Theorem_with_Applications","292215841_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_and_Dense_Bipartite_Subgraphs_via_an_Approximate_Version_of_Caratheodory's_Theorem","265644626_Colorful_linear_programming_Nash_equilibrium_and_pivots","265447611_A_generalization_of_Caratheodory's_theorem","262164131_The_complexity_of_pure_Nash_equilibria","256221965_How_Easy_Is_Local_Search","244956494_A_generalization_of_Radon's_theorem_II","234804319_Points_spheres_and_separators_a_unified_geometric_approach_to_graph_partitioning","234799288_Lectures_on_Discrete_Geometry","232342553_Polynomial_solvability_of_convex_quadratic_programming","228574747_Colourful_Linear_Programming_and_its_Relatives","226173315_Tverberg's_theorem_via_number_fields"]}
