{"id":"346857140_Experimental_Implementation_of_Optical-CDMA_for_Medical_Extra-WBAN_Links","abstract":"We consider the use of optical wireless technology based on infrared signals for multi-user wireless body-area networks (WBANs) in medical applications. For the case of uplink extra-WBAN signal transmission, we propose a simple optical code-division multiple access (O-CDMA) signaling scheme to manage the multiple-access channel. We experimentally evaluate the link performance in terms of bit- and frame-error-rates by implementing the proposed scheme on the programmable logic, and show the efficiency of this approach in dealing with multi-user interference, as well as its low-complexity.","authors":["Jahid Hasan","Mohammad-Ali Khalighi","Bastien BÃ©chadergue"],"meta":["July 2020","DOI:10.1109/CSNDSP49049.2020.9249530","Conference: 2020 12th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)"],"references":["341812357_Channel_Characterization_and_Modeling_for_Optical_Wireless_Body-Area_Networks","317630235_An_Autonomous_Wireless_Body_Area_Network_Implementation_Towards_IoT_Connected_Healthcare_Applications","259005723_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_A_Survey","236235985_Performance_of_a_Mobile_Wireless_Optical_CDMA_Monitoring_System","3872510_A_photon_counting_approach_to_the_performance_analysis_of_indoors_wireless_infrared_CDMA_networks","3435856_Spread_spectrum_techniques_for_indoor_wireless_IR_communications","3338042_A_Scalable_Dual-Clock_FIFO_for_Data_Transfers_Between_Arbitrary_and_Haltable_Clock_Domains","3240467_Analytical_comparison_of_various_fiber-optic_CDMA_receiverstructures","338960652_Channel_characterization_for_optical_extra-WBAN_links_considering_local_and_global_user_mobility","335240602_Enabling_Communication_Technologies_for_Medical_Wireless_Body-Area_Networks","308843460_Wireless_Optical_technology_based_Body_Area_Network_for_health_monitoring_application","294838483_Performance_analysis_for_synchronization_and_system_on_CDMA_optical_fiber_networks","224358729_Wireless_optical_CDMA_LAN_digital_design_concepts","224085161_Wireless_optical_CDMA_LAN_Digital_implementation_analysis","220200814_Applications_challenges_and_prospective_in_emerging_body_area_networking_technologies","200705570_Digital_Communications","4240829_Analysis_of_power_control_for_indoor_wireless_infrared_CDMA_communication","3781378_Performance_of_non-directed_infrared_CDMA","3239753_Chip-level_detection_in_optical_code_division_multiple_access","3226002_Measuring_the_gap_between_FPGAs_and_ASICs","3162017_Code-division_multiple-access_techniques_in_optical_fiber_networks_-_Part_III_Optical_AND_logic_gate_receiver_structure_with_generalized_optical_orthogonal_codes","3160625_Optical_orthogonal_code_acquisition_in_fiber-optic_CDMA_systems_via_the_simple_serial-search_method","3158998_Performance_analysis_of_CDMA_with_imperfect_power_control","3157319_Code_division_multiple-access_techniques_in_optical_fiber_networks_Part_I_Fundamental_principles","3157318_Code_division_multiple-access_techniques_in_optical_fiber_networks_Part_II_Systems_performance_analysis","3077342_Optical_Orthogonal_Codes_Design_Analysis_and_Applications","3046011_Anomalous_Behavior_of_Synchronizer_and_Arbiter_Circuits","2985134_Wireless_Infrared_Communication"]}
