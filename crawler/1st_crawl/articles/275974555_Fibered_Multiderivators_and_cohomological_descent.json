{"id":"275974555_Fibered_Multiderivators_and_cohomological_descent","abstract":"The theory of derivators enhances and simplifies the theory of triangulated\ncategories. In this article a notion of fibered (multi-)derivator is developed,\nwhich similarly enhances fibrations of (monoidal) triangulated categories. We\npresent a theory of cohomological as well as homological descent in this\nlanguage. The main motivation is a descent theory for Grothendieck's six\noperations.","authors":["Fritz HÃ¶rmann"],"meta":["May 2015Theory and Applications of Categories 32","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265993800_Triangulated_categories","265987988_Foundations_of_Grothendieck_Duality_for_Diagrams_of_Schemes","259893607_Tilting_theory_via_stable_homotopy_theory","255523494_Images_directes_cohomologiques_dans_les_categories_de_modeles","237082575_Mayer-Vietoris_sequences_in_stable_derivators","228786288_Proprietes_universelles_et_extensions_de_Kan_derivees","222670868_Representable_Multicategories","221901074_Monoidal_derivators_and_additive_derivators","51965783_Derivators_pointed_derivators_and_stable_derivators","1735395_Localization_theory_for_triangulated_categories"]}
