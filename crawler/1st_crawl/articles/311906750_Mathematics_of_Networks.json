{"id":"311906750_Mathematics_of_Networks","abstract":"The patterns of interactions, both economic and otherwise, between individuals, groups or corporations form social networks whose structure can have a substantial effect on economic outcomes. The study of social networks and their implications has a long history in the social sciences and more recently in applied mathematics and related fields. This article reviews the main developments in the area with a focus on practical applications of network mathematics.","authors":["M. E. J.
