{"id":"313782314_A_Compact_Dual-Band_Beam-Sweeping_Antenna_Based_on_Active_Frequency_Selective_Surfaces","abstract":"A dual-band beam-sweeping antenna based on two independent cylindrical active frequency selective surfaces (AFSS) is proposed in this paper. This antenna is composed of a dual-band omnidirectional monopole antenna operating at 2.45 GHz and 5.2 GHz and two cylindrical AFSS screens. The dual-band omnidirectional monopole antenna is designed as a radiating source and surrounded by the proposed two cylindrical AFSS screens. The unit-cells of the two proposed AFSS screens consist of two metallic crosses connected by a pin-diode vertically. By switching the pin-diodes, the transmission and reflection characteristics of unit-cell of the two AFSS are investigated, respectively, at their own operating frequency. This leads to the variation of the radiation pattern when the cylindrical AFSS screens are loaded around the monopole antenna. Therefore, by switching the pin-diodes with specified combinations, the dual-band beamforming antenna with multiple discrete states can be achieved at 2.45 GHz and 5.2 GHz.","authors":["Jinxin Li","Qingsheng Zeng","Ruizhi Liu","Tayeb A.
