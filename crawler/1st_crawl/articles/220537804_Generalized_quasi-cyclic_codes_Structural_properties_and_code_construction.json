{"id":"220537804_Generalized_quasi-cyclic_codes_Structural_properties_and_code_construction","abstract":"Generalized quasi-cyclic (GQC) codes are defined by generator matrices comprised of circulant matrices of lengths not necessarily\nidentical. A decomposition of these codes is given by using the Chinese reminder theorem. The focus is to characterize œÅ-generator GQC codes in details. A good lower bound on the minimum distance of such a code in terms of the minimum distance \nof the constituent codes is given. Construction methods are given and a set of GQC codes is provided that from minimum distance \nperspective are optimal codes among the known linear codes having the same length and dimension.","authors":["Morteza Esmaeili","Saeideh Yari"],"meta":["June 2009Applicable Algebra in Engineering Communication and Computing 20(2):159-173","DOI:10.1007/s00200-009-0095-3","SourceDBLP"],"references":["248025403_The_structure_of_generalized_quasi_cyclic_codes","220638635_On_the_Algebraic_Structure_of_Quasi-cyclic_Codes_II_Chain_Rings","3080523_On_the_algebraic_structure_of_quasi-cyclic_codes_I_Finite_fields","222675536_Algebraic_structure_of_quasicyclic_codes","220538047_Structural_Properties_and_Enumeration_of_Quasi_Cyclic_Codes","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes","23868793_A_Connection_Between_Block_and_Convolutional_Codes","3085500_On_the_Algebraic_Structure_of_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes_III_Generator_Theory","3079416_A_Link_Between_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes_and_Convolutional_Codes","3079201_New_optimal_binary_linear_codes_of_dimensions_9_and_10","3078486_Six_New_Binary_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes","3078303_Twelve_good_rate_m-rpm_Quasi-cyclic_codes","3078068_Nine_Good_Rate_m_-_1pm_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes","3077802_Some_best_rate_1p_and_rate_p-1p_systematic_quasi-cyclic_codes"]}
