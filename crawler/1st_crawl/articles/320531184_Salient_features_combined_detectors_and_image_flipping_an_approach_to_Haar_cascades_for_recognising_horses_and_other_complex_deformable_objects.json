{"id":"320531184_Salient_features_combined_detectors_and_image_flipping_an_approach_to_Haar_cascades_for_recognising_horses_and_other_complex_deformable_objects","abstract":"The author describes a new 'shortcut' approach to automatically detecting horses in still images and video: salient features, combining and flipping. Horses are complex, deformable (non-rigid) target objects with high levels of intra-class shape variability. A prototype Haar cascade detector was trained to detect what the author calls a 'salient feature'. This a distinctive, minimally changing physical attribute that is easily recognisable from multiple viewpoints. The detector's target object is: 'horse ears' and it only required a total training time of 91 minutes. It was evaluated in combination with an existing, 'asymmetric' detector (trained only to recognise right-facing horses). By combining the existing horse detector with the author's salient feature ears detector, the hit rate for true positives was increased by 50% (relative to the existing detector's performance). Flipping each test image (or video frame) around its vertical axis increased the hit rate by 83% (relative to the unflipped results) for the existing, asymmetric detector, when tested on an image dataset of horses facing in both directions.","authors":["Steve North"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1145/3152130.3152143","Conference: The Fourth International Conference on Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI2017), November 21â€“23, 2017At: Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","Project: Computational Anthrozoology"],"references":["342259636_Horse_Detection_using_Haar_Like_Features","278783507_HABIT_Horse_Automated_Behaviour_Identification_Tool_-_A_Position_Paper","3940582_Rapid_Object_Detection_using_a_Boosted_Cascade_of_Simple_Features","317250827_Assessing_machine_learning_classifiers_for_the_detection_of_animals'_behavior_using_depth-based_tracking","240224936_Rapid_object_detection_using_a_boosted_cascade_of_simple_features"]}
