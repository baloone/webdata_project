{"id":"336885883_Information_diffusion_in_signed_networks","abstract":"Information diffusion has been widely discussed in various disciplines including sociology, economics, physics or computer science. In this paper, we generalize the linear threshold model in signed networks consisting of both positive and negative links. We analyze the dynamics of the spread of information based on balance theory, and find that a signed network can generate path dependence while structural balance can help remove the path dependence when seeded with balanced initialized active nodes. Simulation shows that the diffusion of information based on positive links contradicts that based on negative links. More positive links in signed networks are more likely to activate nodes and remove path dependence, but they can reduce predictability that is based on active states. We also find that a balanced structure can facilitate both the magnitude and speed of information diffusion, remove the path dependence, and cause polarization.","authors":["Xiaochen He","Haifeng Du","Marcus W Feldman","Guangyu Li"],"meta":["October 2019PLoS ONE 14(10):e0224177","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0224177"],"references":["328153719_The_evolution_of_cooperation_in_signed_networks_under_the_impact_of_structural_balance","323526986_Reversing_structural_balance_in_signed_networks","309092420_Efficient_Influence_Maximization_in_Weighted_Independent_Cascade_Model","307556037_Optimizing_transformations_of_structural_balance_in_signed_networks_with_potential_relationships","301417718_Diffusion_Maximization_in_Evolving_Social_Networks","299415966_Linking_Individual_and_Collective_Behavior_in_Adaptive_Social_Networks","297791217_Structural_balance_in_fully_signed_networks","283117754_Efficient_Influence_Maximization_in_Weighted_Independent_Cascade_Model","281273960_An_Integrative_Theory_of_Intergroup_Conflict","279411424_Contagion"]}
