{"id":"314596157_Maximum_ATSP_with_Weights_Zero_and_One_via_Half-Edges","abstract":"We present a fast combinatorial 3 / 4-approximation algorithm for the maximum asymmetric TSP with weights zero and one. The approximation factor of this algorithm matches the currently best one given by Bl√§ser in 2004 and based on linear programming. Our algorithm first computes a maximum size matching and a maximum weight cycle cover without certain cycles of length two but possibly with half-edges - a half-edge of a given edge e is informally speaking a half of e that contains one of the endpoints of e. Then from the computed matching and cycle cover it extracts a set of paths, whose weight is large enough to be able to construct a traveling salesman tour with the claimed guarantee.","authors":["Katarzyna Paluch"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-28684-6_3","Conference: International Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms"],"references":["259742989_Better_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Asymmetric_Traveling_Salesman_and_Shortest_Superstring","226633469_A_79_-_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","226478440_3544-approximation_for_Asymmetric_Maximum_TSP_with_Triangle_Inequality","220994326_Simpler_Approximation_of_the_Maximum_Asymmetric_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","220532704_A_58_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Asymmetric_TSP","265401252_Improved_Inapproximability_Results_for_the_Shortest_Superstring_and_Related_Problems","242929791_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Distances_One_and_Two","239066452_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Weight_Hamiltonian_Circuit","221498588_Long_Tours_and_Short_Superstrings_Preliminary_Version","221462624_Two_Approximation_Algorithms_for_3-Cycle_Covers","221462589_A_34-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Maximum_ATSP_with_Weights_Zero_and_One","220770624_Computing_Cycle_Covers_without_Short_Cycles","220406467_An_813-approximation_algorithm_for_the_asymmetric_maximum_TSP","220154189_Deterministic_78-approximation_for_the_metric_maximum_TSP","220114756_An_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Asymmetric_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_with_Distances_One_and_Two","2366475_Computing_Cycle_Covers_without_Short_Cycles"]}
