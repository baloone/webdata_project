{"id":"302592675_Toward_Self-Assembled_Plasmonic_Devices_High-Yield_Arrangement_of_Gold_Nanoparticles_on_DNA_Origami_Templates","abstract":"Plasmonic structures allow the manipulation of light with materials that are smaller than the optical wavelength. Such structures can consist of plasmonically-active metal nanoparticles and can be fabricated through scalable bottom-up self-assembly on DNA origami templates. To produce functional devices, the precise and high-yield arrangement of each of the nanoparticles on a structure is of vital importance as the absence of a single particle can destroy the functionality of the entire device. Nevertheless, the parameters influencing the yield of the multi-step assembly process are still poorly understood. To overcome this deficiency, we employed a test system consisting of a tubular 6-helix bundle DNA origami with binding sites for eight oligonucleotide-functionalized gold nanoparticles. We systematically studied the assembly yield as a function of a wide range of parameters such as ionic strength, stoichiometric ratio, oligonucleotide-linker chemistry and assembly kinetics by an automated high-throughput analysis of electron micrographs of the formed hetero-complexes. Our optimized protocols enable particle placement yields up to 98.7 % and promise the reliable production of sophisticated DNA-based multi-particle plasmonic devices for applications in photonics, optoelectronics and nanomedicine.","authors":["Fatih Nadi GÃ¼r","Friedrich Schwarz","Jingjing Ye","Stefan Diez"],"meta":["May 2016ACS Nano 10(5)","DOI:10.1021/acsnano.6b01537"],"references":["284022952_Scalable_amplification_of_strand_subsets_from_chip-synthesized_oligonucleotide_libraries","272079768_Mechanical_Design_of_DNA_Nanostructures","271711014_DNA-based_plasmonic_nanostructures","259109988_Hierarchical_assembly_of_metal_nanoparticles_quantum_dots_and_organic_dyes_using_DNA_origami_scaffolds","233806258_Three-Dimensional_Structures_Self-Assembled_from_DNA_Bricks","232742073_Fluorescence_Enhancement_at_Docking_Sites_of_DNA-Directed_Self-Assembled_Nanoantennas","221709110_DNA-based_Self-Assembly_of_Chiral_Plasmonic_Nanostructures_with_Tailored_Optical_Response","51385749_DNA-nanotube-induced_alignment_of_membrane_proteins_for_NMR_structure_determination","51057100_Building_plasmonic_nanostructures_with_DNA_Nat_Nanotechnol_65_268-276","50407863_Construction_of_a_Structurally_Defined_Double-Stranded_DNA_Catenane","41153521_Plasmonics_beyond_the_diffraction_limit","30761391_Observation_of_coupled_plasmon-polariton_modes_in_Au_nanoparticle_chain_waveguides_of_different_lengths_Estimation_of_waveguide_loss","30761389_Optical_pulse_propagation_in_metal_nanoparticle_chain_waveguides","26723443_Folding_DNA_into_Twisted_and_Curved_Nanoscale_Shapes","24442901_Douglas_S_M_Dietz_H_Liedl_T_Hogberg_B_Graf_F_Shih_W_M_Self-assembly_of_DNA_into_nanoscale_three-dimensional_shapes_Nature_459_414-418","23716392_Control_of_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Tubules_Through_Integration_of_Gold_Nanoparticles","7911119_Six-helix_bundles_designed_from_DNA","7237731_Rothemund_PWK_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns_Nature_440_297-302","5617417_DNA-Guided_Crystallization_of_Colloidal_Nanoparticles","283456784_Alignment_of_gold_nanoparticle-decorated_DNA_origami_nanotubes_substrate_prepatterning_vs_molecular_combing","276148866_DNA_Nanostructures_as_Programmable_Biomolecular_Scaffolds","271221660_DNA-Assembled_Nanoparticle_Rings_Exhibit_Electric_and_Magnetic_Resonances_at_Visible_Frequencies","266630710_High_Precision_and_High_Yield_Fabrication_of_Dense_Nanoparticle_Arrays_onto_DNA_Origami_at_Statistically_Independent_Binding_Sites","264902921_Addressing_the_Instability_of_DNA_Nanostructures_in_Tissue_Culture","263971053_Structural_DNA_Nanotechnology_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Perspective","262845318_Surface-Assisted_Large-Scale_Ordering_of_DNA_Origami_Tiles","261800217_Plasmonic_DNA-Origami_Nanoantennas_for_Surface-Enhanced_Raman_Spectroscopy","260759070_DNA_Origami_Based_Assembly_of_Gold_Nanoparticle_Dimers_for_Surface-Enhanced_Raman_Scattering","259387224_Topography-controlled_alignment_of_DNA_origami_nanotubes_on_nanopatterned_surfaces","259333578_DNA_Origami_Substrates_for_Highly_Sensitive_Surface-Enhanced_Raman_Scattering","248396314_Multiscaffold_DNA_Origami_Nanoparticle_Waveguides","234032234_Quantum-Dot_Fluorescence_Lifetime_Engineering_with_DNA_Origami_Constructs","229477390_Metal-nanoparticle_plasmonics","229008715_DNA-Templated_Self-Assembly_of_Metallic_Nanocomponent_Arrays_on_a_Surface","221720767_A_Study_of_the_Nucleation_and_Growth_Processes_in_the_Synthesis_of_Colloidal_Gold","51867820_Synthetically_programmable_nanoparticle_superlattices_using_a_hollow_three-dimensional_spacer_approach","51859009_Rolling_Up_Gold_Nanoparticle-Dressed_DNA_Origami_into_Three-Dimensional_Plasmonic_Chiral_Nanostructures","44614904_DNA_Minicircles_Connected_via_G-Quadruplex_Interaction_Modules","41464707_Gold_Nanoparticle_Self-Similar_Chain_Structure_Organized_by_DNA_Origami","24272176_PyrroleImidazole-Polyamide_Anchors_for_DNA_Tertiary_Interactions","21139270_Synthesis_From_DNA_of_a_Molecule_with_the_Connectivity_of_a_Cube","14445801_Organization_of_Nanocrystal_Molecules_Using_DNA","14445800_A_DNA-based_method_for_rationally_assembling_nanoparticles_into_macroscopic_materials","7271624_Why_Gold_Nanoparticles_Are_More_Precious_than_Pretty_Gold_Noble_Metal_Surface_Plasmon_Resonance_and_Its_Enhancement_of_the_Radiative_and_Nonradiative_Properties_of_Nanocrystals_of_Different_Shapes","6952096_Two-Dimensional_Nanoparticle_Arrays_Show_the_Organizational_Power_of_Robust_DNA_Motifs","6633794_Maximizing_DNA_Loading_on_a_Range_of_Gold_Nanoparticle_Sizes","5341293_Toward_Reliable_Gold_Nanoparticle_Patterning_On_Self-Assembled_DNA_Nanoscaffold"]}
