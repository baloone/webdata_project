{"id":"285530222_The_Detour_Index","abstract":"The detour index w is the sum of all entries in the upper triangle of the detour matrix Δ, where the ij-th entry Δij denotes the length of the longest path between vertices i and j of the underlying graph. The Wiener index W and w are equivalent for acyclic structures, but are different in cycle-containing graphs. Similarly the hyper-Wiener index Γ and its analogue the hyper-detour index γ are equivalent in acyclic structures and are different in cyclic structures. Several formulas were derived for w and γ- Excellent correlations between boiling points and the composite indices (Ww)1/8 and (Γγ)1/10 were found in a series consisting of 77 cyclic and acyclic alkanes.","authors":["I.
