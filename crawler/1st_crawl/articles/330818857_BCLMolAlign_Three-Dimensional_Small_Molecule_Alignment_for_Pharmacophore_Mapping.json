{"id":"330818857_BCLMolAlign_Three-Dimensional_Small_Molecule_Alignment_for_Pharmacophore_Mapping","abstract":"Small molecule flexible alignment is a critical component of both ligand- and structure-based methods in computer-aided drug discovery. Despite its importance, the availability of high-quality flexible alignment software packages is limited. Here, we present BCL::MolAlign, a freely available property-based molecular alignment program. BCL::MolAlign accommodates ligand flexibility through a combination of pre-generated conformers and on-the-fly bond rotation. BCL::MolAlign converges on alignment poses by sampling the relative orientations of mutually-matching atom pairs between molecules through Monte Carlo Metropolis sampling. Across six diverse ligand datasets, BCL::MolAlign flexible alignment outperforms MOE, ROCS, and FLEXS in recovering native ligand binding-poses. Moreover, the BCL::MolAlign alignment score is more predictive of ligand activity across 10 datasets. Finally, on a recently published benchmark set of 20 high quality congeneric ligand-protein complexes, BCL::MolAlign is able to recovery a larger fraction of native binding poses than maximum common substructure-based alignment and ROSETTALIGAND. BCL::MolAlign can be obtained as part of the BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) software package freely with an academic license, or can be accessed via webserver at
