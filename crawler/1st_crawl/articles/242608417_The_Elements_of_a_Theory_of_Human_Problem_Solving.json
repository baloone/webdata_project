{"id":"242608417_The_Elements_of_a_Theory_of_Human_Problem_Solving","abstract":"A description of a theory of problem-solving in terms of information processes amenable for use in a digital computer. The postulates are: \"A control system consisting of a number of memories, which contain symbolized information and are interconnected by various ordering relations; a number of primitive information processes, which operate on the information in the memories; a perfectly definite set of rules for combining these processes into whole programs of processing.\" Examples are given of how processes that occur in behavior can be realized out of elementary information processes. The heuristic value of this theory is pertinent to theories of learning, perception, and concept formation.","authors":["Allen Newell","J. C. Shaw","Herbert A.
