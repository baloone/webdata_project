{"id":"336407878_Computer_algorithm_can_match_physicians'_decisions_about_blood_transfusions","abstract":"Background: \nChecking appropriateness of blood transfusion for quality assurance required enormous usage of time and human resources from the healthcare system. We report here a new machine learning algorithm for checking blood transfusion quality.\n\nMaterials and methods: \nThe multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) was designed to learn an expert's judgement from 4946 clinical cases. The accuracy in predicting the blood transfusion was then reported.\n\nResults: \nWe achieved a 96.8% overall accuracy rate, with a 99% match rate to the experts' judgement on those appropriate cases and 90.9% on the inappropriate cases.\n\nConclusions: \nMachine learning algorithm can accurately match to human judgement by feeding in pre-surgical information and key laboratory variables.","authors":["Yuanyuan Yao","Jenny Alexandra Cifuentes Quintero","Bin Zheng","Min Yan"],"meta":["October 2019Journal of Translational Medicine 17(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12967-019-2085-y","Project: Clinical outcome assessment"],"references":["328947201_Improvements_in_blood_transfusion_management_Cross-sectional_data_analysis_from_nine_hospitals_in_Zhejiang_China","277411157_Deep_Learning","230625352_Clinical_Transfusion_Medicine_Committee_of_the_AABB_Clinical_Transfusion_Medicine_Committee_of_the_AABB_Red_blood_cell_transfusion_a_clinical_practice_guideline_from_the_AABB","326888625_Face_Space_Representations_in_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","321991370_What_can_machine_learning_do_Workforce_implications","269774964_Do_liberal_blood_transfusions_cause_more_harm_than_good","249967167_Transfusing_blood_safely_and_appropriately","236937957_Challenges_in_the_management_of_the_blood_supply","236937956_Alternatives_to_blood_transfusion","236937955_Concepts_of_blood_transfusion_in_adults"]}
