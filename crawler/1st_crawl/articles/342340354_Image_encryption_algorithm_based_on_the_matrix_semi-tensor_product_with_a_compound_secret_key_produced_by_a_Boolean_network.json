First, a new scrambling method is designed. The pixels of the initial plaintext image are randomly divided into four blocks. The pixels in each block are then subjected to different numbers of rounds of Arnold transformation, and the four blocks are combined to generate a scrambled image. Then, a compound secret key is designed. A set of pseudosecret keys is given and filtered through a synchronously updating Boolean network to generate the real secret key. This secret key is used as the initial value of the mixed linear-nonlinear coupled map lattice (MLNCML) system to generate a chaotic sequence. Finally, the STP operation is applied to the chaotic sequences and the scrambled image to generate an encrypted image. Compared with other encryption algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper is more secure and effective, and it is also suitable for color image encryption.","authors":["Xingyuan Wang","Suo Gao"],"meta":["June 2020Information Sciences 539(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2020.06.030"],"references":["340931926_SURVEY_ON_APPLICATIONS_OF_SEMI-TENSOR_PRODUCT_METHOD_IN_NETWORKED_EVOLUTIONARY_GAMES","334774288_DNA_key_based_visual_chaotic_image_encryption","334709365_An_encryption_protocol_for_NEQR_images_based_on_one-particle_quantum_walks_on_a_circle","331168304_A_New_Hybrid_Digital_Chaotic_System_with_Applications_in_Image_Encryption","329876077_Cosine-Transform-Based_Chaotic_System_for_Image_Encryption","328561865_Multi-image_encryption_scheme_based_on_quantum_3D_Arnold_transform_and_scaled_Zhongtang_chaotic_system","328318296_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Quantum_Key_Image","327967331_A_secure_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_fractional_transforms_and_scrambling_in_combination_with_multimodal_biometric_keys","324782403_Bit-level_quantum_color_image_encryption_scheme_with_quantum_cross-exchange_operation_and_hyper-chaotic_system","317734717_An_Alternative_Approach_to_Calculate_the_Structure_Matrix_of_Boolean_Network_with_Semi-Tensor_Product","317174397_Quantum_image_encryption_scheme_with_iterative_generalized_Arnold_transforms_and_quantum_image_cycle_shift_operations","270907125_Lag_Synchronization_of_Switched_Neural_Networks_via_Neural_Activation_Function_and_Applications_in_Image_Encryption","8156020_Genetic_Networks_with_Canalyzing_Boolean_Rules_are_Always_Stable","345520536_Block_Decoupling_of_Boolean_Control_Networks","344961587_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_system_and_compressive_sensing","344960681_Modified_diffractive-imaging-based_image_encryption","340506959_New_developments_in_control_design_techniques_of_logical_control_networks","338459301_Design_and_implementation_of_a_simple_dynamical_4-D_chaotic_circuit_with_applications_in_image_encryption","336181028_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_compressive_sensing_and_hyperchaotic_map","335879020_Stabilization_of_Probabilistic_Boolean_Networks_via_Pinning_Control_Strategy","333732150_Image_encryption_based_on_the_pseudo-orbits_from_1D_chaotic_map","333001201_Chaotic_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_using_Frequency-Domain_DNA_Encoding","332628848_On_the_ensemble_controllability_of_Boolean_control_networks_using_STP_method","332563977_An_adjoint_network_approach_to_design_stabilizable_switching_signals_of_switched_Boolean_networks","332121087_A_color_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_Hopfield_chaotic_neural_network","331282715_Fast_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Parallel_Computing_System","329437586_Fast-Time_Stability_of_Temporal_Boolean_Networks","328818763_A_novel_image_cipher_based_on_3D_bit_matrix_and_Latin_cubes","327444379_Observability_of_Boolean_networks_via_STP_and_graph_methods","325733381_The_transformation_between_the_Galois_NLFSRsand_the_Fibonacci_NLFSRsvia_semi-tensor_product_of_matrices","324527682_Generalized_inverses_of_tensors_via_a_general_product_of_tensors","322195935_A_survey_on_applications_of_semi-tensor_product_method_in_engineering","322090239_Designing_permutation-substitution_image_encryption_networks_with_Henon_map","321657790_DNA_Chaos_Blend_to_Secure_Medical_Privacy","319927883_Quasi_Kronecker_products_and_a_determinant_formula","307533293_A_novel_chaos-based_image_encryption_algorithm_using_DNA_sequence_operations","298428227_Image_compression-encryption_scheme_based_on_hyper-chaotic_system_and_2D_compressive_sensing","290781583_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_double_hyper-chaotic_systems","289983310_Image_encryption_using_2D_Logistic-adjusted-Sine_map","275218996_On_solutions_of_the_matrix_equation_AXB_with_respect_to_semi-tensor_product","273513235_Synchronization_of_Asynchronous_Switched_Boolean_Network","273397232_Synchronization_of_Boolean_Networks_with_Different_Update_Schemes","271659354_Analysis_and_improvement_of_a_chaos-based_symmetric_image_encryption_scheme_using_a_bit-level_permutation","269589453_Semi-tensor_product_of_matrices-A_convenient_new_tool","260214195_Spatiotemporal_chaos_in_mixed_linear-nonlinear_coupled_logistic_map_lattice","259507155_Cryptanalyzing_a_novel_image_fusion_encryption_algorithm_based_on_DNA_sequence_operation_and_hyper-chaotic_system","224116011_A_Linear_Representation_of_Dynamics_of_Boolean_Networks","222392026_A_chaos-based_symmetric_image_encryption_scheme_using_a_bit-level_permutation","220225771_A_novel_color_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaos"]}
