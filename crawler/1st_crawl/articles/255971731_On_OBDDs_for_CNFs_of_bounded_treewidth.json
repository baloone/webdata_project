{"id":"255971731_On_OBDDs_for_CNFs_of_bounded_treewidth","abstract":"Ferrara, Pan, and Vardi showed that a CNF of $n$ variables and the treewidth\n$k$ of its primal graph can be compiled into an Ordered Binary Decision Diagram\n(OBDD) of size $O(n^k)$. In this paper we show that there is an infinite class\nof CNFs for which the OBDD size is at least $\\frac{n^{k/4}}{o(n)}$ thus\nessentially matching the above upper bound. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first result ruling the possibility of fixed-parameter tractable size\nOBDDs for CNFs of bounded treewidth. We also show that the $O(n^k)$ upper bound\nholds for the case where $k$ is the treewidth of the incidence graph of the\ngiven {\\sc cnf}.","authors":["Igor Razgon"],"meta":["August 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["241623395_On_the_tractability_of_query_compilation_and_bounded_treewidth","221606905_Knowledge_Compilation_Properties_of_Tree-of-BDDs","220896401_Treewidth_in_Verification_Local_vs_Global","3042737_On_the_complexity_of_VLSI_implementations_and_graph_representationsof_Boolean_functions_with_application_to_integer_multiplication","2570039_Symbolic_Boolean_Manipulation_with_Ordered_Binary_Decision_Diagrams","2540262_A_Knowledge_Compilation_Map","242306588_Boolean_Function_Complexity_Advances_and_Frontiers","222305559_A_Partial_K-Arboretum_of_Graphs_With_Bounded_Treewidth","221403593_Hierarchical_Representations_of_Discrete_Functions_with_Application_to_Model_Checking","220814030_SDD_A_New_Canonical_Representation_of_Propositional_Knowledge_Bases","220431693_Decomposable_negation_normal_form","2366046_BDDs_-_Design_Analysis_Complexity_and_Applications"]}
