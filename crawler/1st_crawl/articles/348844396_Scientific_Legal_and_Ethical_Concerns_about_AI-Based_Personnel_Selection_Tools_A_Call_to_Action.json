{"id":"348844396_Scientific_Legal_and_Ethical_Concerns_about_AI-Based_Personnel_Selection_Tools_A_Call_to_Action","abstract":"Organizations are increasingly turning toward personnel selection tools that rely on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and machine learning algorithms that, together, intend to predict the future success of employees better than traditional tools. These new forms of assessment include online games, video-based interviews, and the use of large amounts of big data pulled from many sources, including test responses, test-taking behavior, applications, resumes, and social media. Speedy processing, lower costs, convenient access, and applicant engagement are often and rightfully cited as the practical advantages for using these selection tools. At the same time, however, these tools raise serious concerns about their effectiveness in terms their conceptual relevance to the job; their basis in a job analysis to ensure job relevancy; their measurement characteristics (reliability and stability); their validity in predicting employee-relevant outcomes; their evidence and normative information being updated appropriately; and the associated ethical concerns around what information is being represented to employers and told to job candidates. This paper explores these concerns, concluding with an urgent call to industrial and organizational psychologists to extend existing professional standards for employment testing to these new AI and machine learning based forms of testing, including standards and requirements for their documentation.","authors":["Nancy Tippins","Frederick L Oswald","S .
