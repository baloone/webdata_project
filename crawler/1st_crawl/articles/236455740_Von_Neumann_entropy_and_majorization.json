{"id":"236455740_Von_Neumann_entropy_and_majorization","abstract":"We consider the properties of the Shannon entropy for two probability\ndistributions which stand in the relationship of majorization. Then we give a\ngeneralization of a theorem due to Uhlmann, extending it to infinite\ndimensional Hilbert spaces. Finally we show that for any quantum channel\n$\\Phi$, one has $S(\\Phi(\\rho))=S(\\rho)$ for all quantum states $\\rho$ if and\nonly if there exists an isometric operator $V$ such that $\\Phi(\\rho)=V\\rho\nV^*$.","authors":["Yuan Li","Paul Busch"],"meta":["June 2013Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 408:384-393","DOI:10.1016/j.jmaa.2013.06.019","SourcearXiv","Project: Operational Quantum Physics"],"references":["268799105_Stochasticity_and_partial_order_Doubly_stochastic_maps_and_unitary_mixing","238671585_An_infinite_dimensional_Schur-Horn_theorem_and_majorization_theory","2122019_The_Schur-Horn_theorem_for_operators_and_frames_with_prescribed_norms_and_frame_operator","285339132_Introduction","266226281_Some_relations_between_eigenvalues_and_matrix_elements_of_linear_operators","254496948_Further_results_on_entropy_and_separability","251473972_Fixed_points_of_dual_quantum_operations","245344294_An_infinite-dimensional_generalization_of_the_Schur-Horn_convexity_theorem","242987580_Maps_on_states_preserving_the_relative_entropy_II","240504729_Quantum_Information_Theory_and_Quantum_Statistics","230842776_Maps_on_states_preserving_the_relative_entropy","229215093_An_Infinite_Dimensional_Version_of_the_Schur-Horn_Convexity_Theorem","228931541_Quantum_f-divergences_and_error_correction","222643290_General_state_changes_in_quantum_theory","51947093_Von_Neumann_Entropy-Preserving_Quantum_Operations","7191061_Inequalities_between_the_Two_Kinds_of_Eigenvalues_of_a_Linear_Transformation","2216115_An_infinite_dimensional_Schur-Horn_Theorem_and_majorization_theory","2121857_Diagonals_of_self-adjoint_operators"]}
