{"id":"230827048_Evaluation_of_research_in_biomedical_ontologies","abstract":"Ontologies are now pervasive in biomedicine, where they serve as a means to standardize terminology, to enable access to domain\nknowledge, to verify data consistency and to facilitate integrative analyses over heterogeneous biomedical data. For this\npurpose, research on biomedical ontologies applies theories and methods from diverse disciplines such as information management,\nknowledge representation, cognitive science, linguistics and philosophy. Depending on the desired applications in which ontologies\nare being applied, the evaluation of research in biomedical ontologies must follow different strategies. Here, we provide\na classification of research problems in which ontologies are being applied, focusing on the use of ontologies in basic and\ntranslational research, and we demonstrate how research results in biomedical ontologies can be evaluated. The evaluation\nstrategies depend on the desired application and measure the success of using an ontology for a particular biomedical problem.\nFor many applications, the success can be quantified, thereby facilitating the objective evaluation and comparison of research\nin biomedical ontology. The objective, quantifiable comparison of research results based on scientific applications opens\nup the possibility for systematically improving the utility of ontologies in biomedical research.","authors":["Robert Hoehndorf","Michel Dumontier","Georgios Gkoutos"],"meta":["September 2012Briefings in Bioinformatics 14(6)","DOI:10.1093/bib/bbs053","SourcePubMed"],"references":["314773733_BioPortal_Ontologies_and_Integrated_Data_Resources_at_the_Click_of_a_Mouse","342183905_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_for_Nominal_Scales","320181808_The_Construction_of_Social_Reality","319056467_PhenomeNET_A_whole-phenome_approach_to_disease_gene_discovery","319001718_Interoperability_between_biomedical_ontologies_through_relation_expansion_upper-level_ontologies_and_automatic_reasoning","319001444_Improving_ontologies_by_automatic_reasoning_and_evaluation_of_logical_definitions","314723003_Evolution_of_the_Sequence_Ontology_terms_and_relationships","313764016_Pellet_An_OWL_DL_reasoner","313751764_An_overview_of_ONTOCLEAN","313005530_Ontology_of_Time_in_GFO"]}
