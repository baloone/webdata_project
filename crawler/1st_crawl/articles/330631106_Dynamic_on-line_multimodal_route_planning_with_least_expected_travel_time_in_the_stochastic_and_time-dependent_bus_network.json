{"id":"330631106_Dynamic_on-line_multimodal_route_planning_with_least_expected_travel_time_in_the_stochastic_and_time-dependent_bus_network","abstract":"Route planning system in bus network is very important on providing passengers a better experience for public transportation services. This work presents a new on-line dynamic path planning algorithm in a stochastic and time-dependent bus network, with the objective of least expected travel time. Firstly, an initial optimal path is found when a passenger leaves from the starting location at time t for the destination location. Secondly, when the passenger reaches a bus stop, the real time traffic condition is checked to decide whether the optimal path should be modified and re-calculated. If so, the shortest path algorithm is re-applied to find the new path. The simulation scenario is executed to show the performance and efficiency of the proposed dynamic path planning system.","authors":["Jinjian Li","Arnaud Doniec","Jacques Boonaert","Guillaume Lozenguez"],"meta":["January 2019MATEC Web of Conferences 259(3):01002","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/201925901002"],"references":["271458021_A_comparative_study_of_vehicles'_routing_algorithms_for_route_planning_in_smart_cities","308838769_DEPART_Dynamic_Route_Planning_in_Stochastic_Time-Dependent_Public_Transit_Networks","286130000_How_to_find_the_optimal_paths_in_stochastic_time-dependent_transportation_networks","283349135_Adaptive_route_guidance_based_on_real-time_information_in_stochastic_time-dependent_transportation_networks","279836238_Optimal_adaptive_routing_and_traffic_assignment_in_stochastic_time-dependent_networks","249234211_Improved_results_for_route_planning_in_stochastic_transportation","224817586_The_Fastest_Path_through_a_Network_with_Random_Time-Dependent_Travel_Times","222557043_Adaptive_Route_Choices_in_Risky_Traffic_Networks_A_Prospect_Theory_Approach","222424545_Optimal_routing_policy_problems_in_stochastic_time-dependent_networks","220779235_Commuting_with_delay_prone_buses","220413153_Least_Expected_Time_Paths_in_Stochastic_Time-Varying_Transportation_Networks","220412981_Shortest_Path_Algorithms_An_Evaluation_Using_Real_Road_Networks","37454736_TraCI_An_Interface_for_Coupling_Road_Traffic_and_Network_Simulators","4094587_A_practical_route_planning_algorithm_for_vehicle_navigation_system"]}
