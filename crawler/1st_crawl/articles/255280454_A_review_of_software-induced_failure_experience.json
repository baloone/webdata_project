{"id":"255280454_A_review_of_software-induced_failure_experience","abstract":"We present a review of software-induced failures in commercial nuclear power plants (NPPs) and in several non-nuclear industries. We discuss the approach used for connecting operational events related to these failures and the insights gained from this review. In particular, we elaborate on insights that can be used to model this kind of failure in a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) model. We present the conclusions reached in these areas.","authors":["Tsong-Lun Chu","G. MARTINEZ-GURIDI","Meng Yue","J. R.
