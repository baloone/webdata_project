{"id":"318715480_Pseudo_basic_steps_bound_improvement_guarantees_from_Lagrangian_decomposition_in_convex_disjunctive_programming","abstract":"An elementary, but fundamental, operation in disjunctive programming is a basic step, which is the intersection of two disjunctions to form a new disjunction. Basic steps bring a disjunctive set in regular form closer to its disjunctive normal form and, in turn, produce relaxations that are at least as tight. An open question is: What are guaranteed bounds on the improvement from a basic step? In this paper, using properties of a convex disjunctive programâ€™s hull reformulation and multipliers from Lagrangian decomposition, we introduce an operation called a pseudo basic step and use it to provide provable bounds on this improvement along with techniques to exploit this information when solving a disjunctive program as a convex MINLP. Numerical examples illustrate the practical benefits of these bounds. In particular, on a set of K-means clustering instances, we make significant bound improvements relative to state-of-the-art commercial mixed-integer programming solvers.","authors":["Dimitri J Papageorgiou","Francisco Trespalacios"],"meta":["July 2017EURO Journal on Computational Optimization 6(1):1-29","DOI:10.1007/s13675-017-0088-0"],"references":["301902874_On_handling_indicator_constraints_in_mixed_integer_programming","256821709_Nonlinear_Programming","230872616_Nonlinear_Programming","230872609_Lectures_on_Modern_Convex_Optimization_Analysis_Algorithms_and_Engineering_Applications","230596114_The_Scope_of_Integer_and_Combinatorial_Optimization","225349362_Convex_programming_for_disjunctive_convex_optimization","220589237_A_Lift-and-Project_Cutting_Plane_Algorithm_for_Mixed_0-1_Programs","215774330_Just_MIP_it","30867666_Disjunctive_Programming_and_a_Hierarchy_of_Relaxations_for_Discrete_Optimization_Problems","297617569_Lagrangean_Relaxation_of_the_Hull-Reformulation_of_Linear_Generalized_Disjunctive_Programs_and_its_use_in_Disjunctive_Branch_and_Bound","276913232_On_mathematical_programming_with_indicator_constraints","273296537_Algorithmic_Approach_for_Improved_Mixed-Integer_Reformulations_of_Convex_Generalized_Disjunctive_Programs","273001565_Disjunctive_Programming","266014328_Correction_to_Disjunctive_programming","260593224_Nonlinear_Programming_2nd_ed","260281929_Systematic_modeling_of_discrete-continuous_optimization_models_through_generalized_disjunctive_programming","242146015_Reformulations_Relaxations_and_Cutting_Planes_for_Linear_Generalized_Disjunctive_Programming","238735931_Integer_and_combhtatorial_optimization","227170532_A_Branch-and-Cut_Method_for_0-1_Mixed_Convex_Programming","226439195_Disjunctive_Programming","223398155_Disjunctive_programming_Properties_of_the_convex_hull_of_feasible_points_1","222851135_Modeling_and_Computational_Techniques_for_Logic_Based_Integer_Programming","222674051_Branching_rules_revisited","220289945_A_hierarchy_of_relaxations_for_nonlinear_convex_generalized_disjunctive_programming","220288192_A_hierarchy_of_relaxations_for_linear_generalized_disjunctive_programming","24065429_Lagrangean_relaxation","2401145_Generating_Cuts_from_Multiple-Term_Disjunctions"]}
