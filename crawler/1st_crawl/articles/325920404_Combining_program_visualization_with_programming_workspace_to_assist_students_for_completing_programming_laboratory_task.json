{"id":"325920404_Combining_program_visualization_with_programming_workspace_to_assist_students_for_completing_programming_laboratory_task","abstract":"Numerous Program Visualization tools (PVs) have been developed for assisting novice students to understand their source code further. However, none of them are practical to be used in the context of completing programming laboratory task; students are required to keep switching between PV and programming workspace when they need to know how their code works. This paper combines PV with programming workspace to handle such issue. Resulted tool (which is named PITON) has 13 features extracted from PythonTutor, PyCharm, and studentâ€™s feedbacks about PythonTutor. According to think-aloud and user study, PITON is more practical to be used than a combination of PythonTutor and PyCharm. Further, its features are considerably helpful; students rated these features as useful and frequently used.","authors":["Elvina Elvina","Oscar Karnalim","Mewati Ayub","Maresha Caroline Wijanto"],"meta":["September 2018Journal of Technology and Science Education 8(4):268","DOI:10.3926/jotse.420","Project: Evaluation of Cognitive Impact of Program Visualization in Learning Programming"],"references":["323462365_A_Quasi-Experimental_Design_to_Evaluate_the_Use_of_PythonTutor_on_Programming_Laboratory_Session","322656082_The_Effectiveness_of_a_Program_Visualization_Tool_on_Introductory_Programming_A_Case_Study_with_PythonTutor","321586960_The_Use_of_PythonTutor_on_Programming_Laboratory_Session_Student_Perspectives","320570651_Omnicode_A_Novice-Oriented_Live_Programming_Environment_with_Always-On_Run-Time_Value_Visualizations","319294104_TASNOP_A_tool_for_teaching_algorithms_to_solve_network_optimization_problems","318959842_Extending_The_Effectiveness_of_Algorithm_Visualization_with_Performance_Comparison_through_Evaluation-integrated_Development","318930421_Complexitor_An_Educational_Tool_for_Learning_Algorithm_Time_Complexity_in_Practical_Manner","318930418_Introducing_An_Educational_Tool_for_Learning_Branch_Bound_Strategy","307569528_AP-ASD1_An_Indonesian_Desktop-based_Educational_Tool_for_Basic_Data_Structure_Course","288590176_Learning_algorithms_with_unified_and_interactive_web-based_visualization"]}
