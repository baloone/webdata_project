{"id":"232464210_Learning_and_memory_2nd_ed","abstract":"The learning and memory literature is so extensive that many authors of learning texts have made the decision to limit their coverage to a single area (e.g., classical conditioning, animal learning, human memory, etc.). I believe, however, that students, particularly those who are unable to take additional learning and memory courses, should have the opportunity to become acquainted with as many of the basic learning and memory topics as possible. Therefore, my objective in writing this text is to provide as wide a coverage as possible, consonant with appropriate depth, that can be covered in a single semester. \n\nOverall, this edition provides a more complete historical account of the development of constructs that are of basic importance in the study of learning and memory.
