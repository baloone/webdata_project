{"id":"301399225_Evaluating_the_awareness_support_of_COLLECE_a_collaborative_programming_tool","abstract":"The area of programming learning can take advantage of the principles of CSCW. Thus, there exist several systems that have approached to these difficulties. However, awareness support is quite limited in most of these systems. The COLLECE system is one of such tools as it was developed with the goal of supporting synchronous collaborative programming tasks. In this work, an experience of evaluation of this tool is described. Such evaluation focuses on the elements of awareness support that COLLECE includes. The study puts together several techniques for the evaluation of interactive systems, such as questionnaires, empirical testing, heuristic evaluation and eye tracking. The combination of all these techniques has allowed us to carry out a complete analysis of the COLLECE system and its awareness support.","authors":["Ana Isabel Molina Díaz","Jesús Gallardo","Miguel Ángel Redondo","Crescencio Bravo"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1145/2662253.2662264","Conference: the XV International Conference"],"references":["230786738_Eye_tracking_in_human-computer_interaction_and_usability_research_Current_status_and_future_prospects","263464369_User_acceptance_of_information_technology_System_characteristics_user_perceptions_and_behavioral_impacts","256992016_A_groupware_system_to_support_collaborative_programming_Design_and_experiences","30833698_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_System_Characteristics_User_Perceptions_and_Behavioral_Impacts"]}
