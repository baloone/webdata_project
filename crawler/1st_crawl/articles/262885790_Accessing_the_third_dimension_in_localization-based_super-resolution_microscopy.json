{"id":"262885790_Accessing_the_third_dimension_in_localization-based_super-resolution_microscopy","abstract":"Only a few years after its inception, localization-based super-resolution microscopy has become widely employed in biological studies. Yet, it is primarily used in two-dimensional imaging and accessing the organization of cellular structures at the nanoscale in three dimensions (3D) still poses important challenges. Here, we review optical and computational techniques that enable the 3D localization of individual emitters and the reconstruction of 3D super-resolution images. These techniques are grouped into three main categories: PSF engineering, multiple plane imaging and interferometric approaches. We provide an overview of their technical implementation as well as commentary on their applicability. Finally, we discuss future trends in 3D localization-based super-resolution microscopy.","authors":["Bassam Hajj","Mohamed El Beheiry","Ignacio Izeddin","Xavier Darzacq"],"meta":["June 2014Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics 16(31)","DOI:10.1039/c4cp01380h","SourcePubMed"],"references":["260169293_A_simple_method_to_estimate_the_average_localization_precision_of_a_single-molecule_localization_microscopy_experiment","257884667_A_high-density_3D_localization_algorithm_for_stochastic_optical_reconstruction_microscopy","255975110_Fast_and_High-Accuracy_Localization_for_Three-Dimensional_Single-Particle_Tracking","253647406_ViSP_Representing_single-particle_localizations_in_three_dimensions","262985247_Isotropic_3D_Super-resolution_Imaging_with_a_Self-bending_Point_Spread_Function","260833335_Three-dimensional_live_microscopy_beyond_the_diffraction_limit","260430523_Corrigendum_Fluorophore_localization_algorithms_for_super-resolution_microscopy","259119893_Single_Particle_Tracking_and_Single_Molecule_Energy_Transfer","255985575_Neuroscience_thinks_big_and_collaboratively","255765586_Conformational_analysis_of_single_polymer_chains_in_three_dimensions_by_super-resolution_fluorescence_microscopy","253234361_Quantitative_Nanoscopy_of_Inhibitory_Synapses_Counting_Gephyrin_Molecules_and_Receptor_Binding_Sites","236939526_Video-rate_nanoscopy_using_sCMOS_camera-specific_single-molecule_localization_algorithms","236459854_Measuring_image_resolution_in_optical_nanoscopy","236919383_Fourier_ring_correlation_as_a_resolution_criterion_for_super-resolution_microscopy","236090280_FISH-quant_automatic_counting_of_transcripts_in_3D_FISH_images"]}
