{"id":"315437737_Investigating_the_predictive_power_of_TAM_A_case_study_of_CEGEP_students'_intentions_to_use_online_learning_technologies","abstract":"The purpose of this research is to investigate pre-university science Collège d’enseignement général et professionnel (CEGEP) students’ behavioral intentions towards using online learning technologies. Heretofore, CEGEP students’ use of technology has received scant attention, yet online learning technologies are found to play an increasingly important role in CEGEP classrooms today. The present study seeks to address this by examining CEGEP students’ use of online learning technologies. Our main research question was: What factors affect CEGEP students’ intentions to use online learning technologies? A total of 213 CEGEP students were surveyed, the resulting data was analyzed using the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis MIS Quarterly, 13(3), 319, 1989). The findings of this research provide guidance for future implementations of online learning technologies in the CEGEP education system.","authors":["Paul Bazelais","Tenzin Doleck","David Lemay"],"meta":["January 2018Education and Information Technologies 23(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-017-9587-0"],"references":["313693781_How_does_grit_impact_college_students'_academic_achievement_in_science","311766005_The_Partial_Least_Squares_Approach_to_Structural_Equation_Modeling","320663613_Viability_of_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_in_Multimedia_Learning_Environments_A_Comparative_Study","319356394_Use_of_partial_least_squares_PLS_in_strategic_management_research_a_review_of_four_recent_studies","318014357_Diffusion_of_Innovations","313754714_A_model_of_the_antecedents_of_perceived_PEOU_Development_and_test","313706668_Blended_learning_systems_Definition_current_trends_and_future_directions","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","313208577_A_Paradigm_for_Developing_Better_Measures_of_Marketing_Constructs","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","311644620_Structural_equation_modeling_and_regression_guidelines_for_research_practice","311001627_Examining_CEGEP_students'_acceptance_of_computer-based_learning_environments_A_test_of_two_models","303750301_Using_the_technology_acceptance_model_to_explain_how_attitudes_determine_Internet_usage_The_role_of_perceived_access_barriers_and_demographics","291956056_Youths'_Social_Media_Adoption_Theoretical_Model_and_Empirical_Evidence","304534338_Understanding_Attitudes_and_Predicting_Social_Behavior"]}
