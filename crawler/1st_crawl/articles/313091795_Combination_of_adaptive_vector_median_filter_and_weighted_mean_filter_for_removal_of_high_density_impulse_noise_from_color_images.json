In the proposed filtering scheme, the noisy and non-noisy pixels are classified based on the non-causal linear prediction error. For a noisy pixel, the adaptive vector median filter is processed over the pixel where the window size is adapted based on the availability of good pixels. Whereas, a non-noisy pixel is substituted with the weighted mean of the good pixels of the processing window. The experiments have been carried out on a large database for different classes of images, and the performance is measured in terms of PSNR, MSE, SSIM and FSIMC. It is observed from the experiments that the proposed filter outperforms (~1.5 to 6 dB improvement) some of the existing noise removal techniques not only at low density impulse noise but also at high density impulse noise.","authors":["Amarjit Roy","Joyeeta Singha","Lalit Manam","Rabul Laskar"],"meta":["January 2017Image Processing, IET 11(6)","DOI:10.1049/iet-ipr.2016.0320","Project: noise removal"],"references":["289638660_Impulse_noise_removal_based_on_SVM_classification","272255395_Switching_vector_median_filters_based_on_non-causal_linear_prediction_for_detection_of_impulse_noise","259509962_A_switching_weighted_vector_median_filter_based_on_edge_detection","258650913_Structural_Similarity_Measure_for_Color_Images","228589417_Application_of_the_adaptive_center-weighted_vector_median_framework_for_the_enhancement_of_cDNA_microarray_images","3328020_Salt-and-Pepper_Noise_Removal_by_Median-Type_Noise_Detectors_and_Detail-Preserving_Regularization","3327793_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","2984301_Vector_median_filters","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","311511587_Non-casual_linear_prediction_based_adaptive_filter_for_removal_of_high_density_impulse_noise_from_color_images","301380771_Impulse_noise_removal_using_SVM_classification_based_fuzzy_filter_from_gray_scale_images","283520231_Multiclass_SVM_based_adaptive_filter_for_removal_of_high_density_impulse_noise_from_color_images","283148956_Efficient_Improvements_on_the_BDND_Filtering_Algorithm_for_Removal_of_High-Density_Impulse_Noise","274106581_Exploratory_Data_Analysis","272928815_Exploratory_Data_Analysis","266378411_Removal_of_High-Density_Salt-and-Pepper_Noise_in_Images_With_an_Iterative_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Filter_Using_Alpha-Trimmed_Mean","264790916_Real-Time_Impulse_Noise_Suppression_from_Images_Using_an_Efficient_Weighted-Average_Filtering","264439937_Vector_median_filter_based_on_non-causal_linear_prediction_for_detection_of_impulse_noise_from_images","263509638_An_Improved_Recursive_and_Adaptive_Median_Filter_for_High_Density_Impulse_Noise","261563012_Color_differences_based_fuzzy_filter_for_extremely_corrupted_color_images","257731821_Tang_C_Random-valued_impulse_noise_removal_using_fuzzy_weighted_non-local_means_Signal_Image_Video_Process_82_349-355","257731791_A_new_approach_for_high_density_saturated_impulse_noise_removal_using_decision-based_coupled_window_median_filter","246970944_Nonlinear_nonsuperposal_methods_for_smoothing_data","224250222_Noise_adaptive_switching_median-based_filter_for_impulse_noise_removal_from_extremely_corrupted_images","224223082_Removal_of_High_Density_Salt_and_Pepper_Noise_Through_Modified_Decision_Based_Unsymmetric_Trimmed_Median_Filter","224216147_FSIM_A_Feature_SIMilarity_index_for_image_quality_assessment","224107132_Removal_of_impulse_noise_from_color_image","223218546_A_switching_vector_median_filter_based_on_the_CIELAB_color_space_for_color_image_restoration","223036570_Histogram-based_fuzzy_colour_filter_for_image_restoration","222835467_Fast_adaptive_similarity_based_impulsive_noise_reduction_filter","3343150_An_Iterative_Procedure_for_Removing_Random-Valued_Impulse_Noise","3184202_Center_weighted_median_filters_and_their_application_to_image_enhancement"]}
