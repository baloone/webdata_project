{"id":"333584092_Smart_service_experience_in_hospitality_and_tourism_services_A_conceptualization_and_future_research_agenda","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to offer a discussion, definition and comprehensive conceptualization of the smart service experience, i.e. the way guests and customers in hospitality and tourism experience and value the use of personalized and pro-active services that the intelligent use of data and technology enable.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nBased on prior research on service experience, smart services and the differences between regular and smart services, this paper develops a conceptual framework in which the smart service experience is the central construct.\n\nFindings\n\nThe characteristics of smart services (the intelligent, anticipatory, and adaptable use of data and technology) permit customers to experience services that previous conceptualizations of the service experience could not capture. The smart service experience provides empowerment, a seamless experience, enjoyment, privacy and security, and accurate service delivery. The paper also discusses challenges that service firms face in employing smart services, and proposes a future research agenda.\n\nPractical implications\n\nBoth academics and practitioners expect smart services to revolutionize many industries such as tourism and hospitality. Therefore, research is needed to help understand the way customers experience smart services, what values they derive from them and the way service firms can employ them sensibly to enhance customersâ€™ experiences.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThis paper synthesizes insights from the literature on customer experience, smart services and co-creation into a conceptualization of the smart service experience, and distinguishes it from previous conceptualizations of regular services.","authors":["Sertan Kabadayi","Faizan Ali","Hyeyoon Choi","Herm Joosten"],"meta":["June 2019Journal of
