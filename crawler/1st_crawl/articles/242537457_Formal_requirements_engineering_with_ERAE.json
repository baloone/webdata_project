{"id":"242537457_Formal_requirements_engineering_with_ERAE","abstract":"Requirements engineering is the activity investigating the user's needs in the context of a software development project. This activity is critical because it takes place early in the project's history, and its errors are often discovered late, most of the time only when the software system is delivered. Despite this fact, it currently relies more on interviewing techniques and ambiguous drawings than on a sound technical basis. In the context of the ESPRIT project METEOR, we have developed an approach to requirements engineering based on an expressive and formal language, called ERAE, complemented with methodological guidance. The most influential idea in this project has been that better requirements will be obtained by not focusing on the needed software system, but rather on the larger system formed by the computer and its environment. Two other specificities of our approach are the expressiveness and the formality of the ERAE language. The language is conceptually close to the natural way users express themselves, and requires little paraphrasing when recording the requirements. Its formality not only ensures its unambiguity but also provides for deductive power which helps detecting a number of misunderstandings induced by the unreliable communication with customers. This paper presents the language, and illustrates the role of formality in the methodology.","authors":["Eric Dubois","J.
