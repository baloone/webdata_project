{"id":"339551906_Effective_Workflow_for_High-Performance_Recognition_of_Fruits_using_Machine_Learning_Approaches","abstract":"Recognition system is an essential combat of computer science. Fruit recognition is one of them. Researcher have been roaming around this area for a decade now. Previously, many traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning methods have been employed for successful recognition of fruits and in some cases, a high accuracy have been achieved. However, in our study we showed that our proposed working diagram outperformed all the previous studies. In this paper, we started with Fruit-360 dataset of 109 distinct classes and applied three feature extraction methods (hu moments, haralick texture and color histogram). After that we applied several machine learning approaches (Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) to train the models. Finally, the test results were calculated and K-Nearest Neighbor along with Random Forest classifiers produced best results with a false positive rate of 0%, hence, achieving a high accuracy.","authors":["Abdul Kader","Samiha Sharif","Pranta Bhowmick","Fahmida Haque Mim"],"meta":["February 2020","Project: Fruit-360 Classification"],"references":["338360652_Pure-CNN_A_Framework_for_Fruit_Images_Classification","302341151_Textural_Features_for_Image_Classification","236954019_A_Radial_Basis_Function_Approach_to_a_Color_Image_Classification_Problem_in_a_Real_Time_Industrial_Application","228451484_Classification_and_Regression_by_RandomForest","224223550_The_NumPy_Array_A_Structure_for_Efficient_Numerical_Computation","224146066_Analysis_of_Hu's_moment_invariants_on_image_scaling_and_rotation","319207907_Pattern_Classification","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","227097681_Ordinal_Logistic_Regression","224112437_The_Distance-Weighted_k-Nearest-Neighbor_Rule","222511520_Introduction_to_ROC_analysis","220632709_An_identification_approach_for_2-D_autoregressive_models_in_describing_textures","3113849_A_Survey_of_Decision_Tree_Classifier_Methodology_IEEE_Transactions_on_Systems"]}
