{"id":"220576935_Proving_primality_in_essentially_quartic_random_time","abstract":"This paper presents an algorithm that, given a prime n , finds and verifies a proof of the primality of n in random time ({lg} n)^{4+o(1)} . Several practical speedups are incorporated into the algorithm and discussed in detail.","authors":["Daniel J.
