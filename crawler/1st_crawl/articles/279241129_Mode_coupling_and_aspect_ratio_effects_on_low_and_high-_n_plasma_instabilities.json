{"id":"279241129_Mode_coupling_and_aspect_ratio_effects_on_low_and_high-_n_plasma_instabilities","abstract":"In magnetically confined toroidal plasmas such as tokamaks, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities experience strong toroidal and nonlinear mode coupling effects. Resistive MHD simulations with the M3D code show the importance of mode coupling and compressible MHD effects, which contribute to stronger mode coupling. For the m/n = 1/1 internal kink mode and sawtooth crash and for the edge localized mode (ELM) at higher n, MHD reproduces many features of the experimental observations, including the fast sawtooth crash and the moderate n ~ 10 toroidal harmonics of the ELM. A general property of the perpendicular momentum equation in toroidal fusion plasmas is that the unbalanced radial forces remain relatively small, so that the terms that are lowest order in small inverse aspect ratio mostly cancel. The higher order terms then have significant effects, even at small r/Ro and small amplitude. Effects are strongest for the lowest toroidal harmonics n 1 and the most strongly driven ones with highest amplitude. Unlike the n = 1 internal kink mode, the small amplitude ELM ballooning/peeling-type mode, and thus ELM MHD marginal stability, may be reasonably described by the lowest order in aspect ratio, for moderate and large n 10. The ELM crash, however, depends on higher order.","authors":["L.E.
