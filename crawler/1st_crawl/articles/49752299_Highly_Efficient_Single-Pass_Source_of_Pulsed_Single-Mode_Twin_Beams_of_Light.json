{"id":"49752299_Highly_Efficient_Single-Pass_Source_of_Pulsed_Single-Mode_Twin_Beams_of_Light","abstract":"We report the realization of a bright ultrafast type II parametric down-conversion source of twin beams free of any spatiotemporal correlations in a periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PP-KTP) waveguide. From a robust, single-pass setup it emits pulsed two-mode squeezed vacuum states: photon-number entangled pairs of single-mode pulses or, in terms of continuous variables quantum optics, pulsed Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states in the telecom wavelength regime. We verify the single-mode character of our source by measuring Glauber correlation functions g(2) and demonstrate with a pump energy as low as 75 pJ per pump pulse a mean photon number of 2.5.","authors":["Andreas Eckstein","Andreas Christ","Peter J Mosley","Christine Silberhorn"],"meta":["January 2011Physical Review Letters 106(1):013603","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.013603","SourcePubMed"],"references":["51394667_Heralded_Generation_of_Ultrafast_Single_Photons_in_Pure_Quantum_States","43445039_Experimental_investigation_of_continuous-variable_quantum_teleportation","38038536_Quadrature_squeezing_with_ultrashort_pulses_in_nonlinear-optical_waveguides","30764619_Generation_of_Squeezed_States_by_Parametric_Down_Conversion","26813945_Fiber-assisted_Single_Photon_Spectrograph","235577941_Eliminating_frequency_and_space-time_correlations_in_multiphoton_states","235455137_Biphoton_wave_packets_in_parametric_down-conversion_Spectral_and_temporal_structure_and_degree_of_entanglement","233835323_Quantum_Repeaters_The_Role_of_Imperfect_Local_Operations_in_Quantum_Communication","27260968_Characterization_of_Gaussian_operations_and_distillation_of_Gaussian_states","26314973_Bright_narrowband_source_of_photon_pairs_at_optical_telecommunication_wavelengths_using_a_type-II_periodically_poled_lithium_niobate_waveguide"]}
