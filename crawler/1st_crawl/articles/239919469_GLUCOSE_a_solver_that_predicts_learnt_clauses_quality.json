{"id":"239919469_GLUCOSE_a_solver_that_predicts_learnt_clauses_quality","abstract":"GLUCOSE is based on a new scoring scheme for the clause learning mechanism, based on the paper (Audemard and Simon, 2009). This short competi- tion report summarizes the techniques embedded in the competition 09 version of GLUCOSE. Solver's name comes from glue clauses, a particular kind of clauses that GLUCOSE detects and preserves during search.
