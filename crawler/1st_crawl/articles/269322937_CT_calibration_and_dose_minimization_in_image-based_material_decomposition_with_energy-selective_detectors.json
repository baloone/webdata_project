This blower was shown to promote the freeze-drying process in a low-pressure environment. Using a freeze-drying equipment which has a cold trap and heating plate that supplies the latent heat to materials, several sponge blocks and chemical powder were frozen and dried, and the drying time was shortened to almost a half by this blower.","authors":["Sebastian Faby","Stefan Kuchenbecker","David Simons","Heinz-Peter Schlemmer"],"meta":["March 2014Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering 9033:903318","DOI:10.1117/12.2042877","Conference: SPIE Medical Imaging"],"references":["231862201_Imaging_properties_of_small-pixel_spectroscopic_X-ray_detectors_based_on_cadmium_telluride_sensors","224375710_Medipix_imaging_-_Evaluation_of_datasets_with_PCA","221706517_Empirical_Multiple_Energy_Calibration_EMEC_for_Material--Selective_CT","51588447_Detection_of_periarticular_urate_deposits_with_dual_energy_CT_in_patients_with_acute_gouty_arthritis","42390528_Spectroscopic_multi-energy_CT_distinguishes_iodine_and_barium_contrast_material_in_MICE","22186886_Energy-selective_reconstructions_in_X-ray_computerized_tomography","21108621_Semiempirical_model_for_generating_tungsten_target_X-ray_spectra","7427825_First_performance_evaluation_of_a_dual-source_CT_DSCT_system","5238993_Experimental_feasibility_of_multi-energy_photon-counting_K-edge_imaging_in_pre-clinical_computed_tomography","3150871_The_Medipix3_Prototype_a_Pixel_Readout_Chip_Working_in_Single_Photon_Counting_Mode_With_Improved_Spectrometric_Performance","271488869_Multi-energy_performance_of_a_research_prototype_CT_scanner_with_small-pixel_counting_detector","258713526_First_results_from_a_hybrid_prototype_CT_scanner_for_exploring_benefits_of_quantum-counting_in_clinical_CT","257347986_Vision_2020_Single_photon_counting_x-ray_detectors_in_medical_imaging","238014927_A_research_prototype_system_for_quantum-counting_clinical_CT","236623707_Processing_of_spectral_X-ray_data_with_principal_components_analysis","235895898_Statistical_Reconstruction_of_Material_Decomposed_Data_in_Spectral_CT","235878438_Quantitative_material_characterization_from_multi-energy_photon_counting_CT","232928773_Toward_quantifying_the_composition_of_soft_tissues_by_spectral_CT_with_Medipix3","232772296_New_Dimensions_in_Imaging_The_Awakening_of_Dual-Energy_CT_Comment","221706505_Dose_Minimization_for_Material--Selective_CT_with_Energy--Selective_Detectors","50938072_Modeling_the_performance_of_a_photon_counting_x-ray_detector_for_CT_Energy_response_and_pulse_pileup_effects","50248204_Least_squares_parameter_estimation_methods_for_material_decomposition_with_energy_discriminating_detectors","47520094_Dual-Source_Dual-Energy_CT_With_Additional_Tin_Filtration_Dose_and_Image_Quality_Evaluation_in_Phantoms_and_In_Vivo","24274766_Carotid_Computed_Tomography_Angiography_With_Automated_Bone_Suppression_A_Comparative_Study_Between_Dual_Energy_and_Bone_Subtraction_Techniques","22527536_A_Quantitative_Theory_of_the_Hounsfield_Unit_and_Its_Application_to_Dual_Energy_Scanning","6203123_K-edge_imaging_in_x-ray_computed_tomography_using_multi-bin_photon_counting_detectors","5918168_Empirical_dual_energy_calibration_EDEC_for_cone-beam_computed_tomography"]}
