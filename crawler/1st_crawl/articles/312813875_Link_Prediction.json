{"id":"312813875_Link_Prediction","abstract":"Social and information networks evolve according to certain regularities. Hence, given a network structure, some potential links are more likely to occur than others. This leads to the question of link prediction: how can one predict which links will occur in a future snapshot of the network and/or which links are missing from an incomplete network?\nThis chapter provides a practical overview of link prediction. We present a general overview of the link prediction process and discuss its importance to applications like recommendation and anomaly detection, as well as its significance to theoretical issues. We then discuss the different steps to be taken when performing a link prediction process, including preprocessing, predictor choice, and evaluation. This is illustrated on a small-scale case study of researcher collaboration, using the freely available linkpred tool.","authors":["Raf Guns"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10377-8_2","In book: Measuring Scholarly Impact (pp.35-55)"],"references":["266827102_LPmade_Link_Prediction_Made_Easy","266620953_Recommending_research_collaborations_using_link_prediction_and_random_forest_classifiers","314818914_SimRank_a_measure_of_structural-context_similarity","310792775_The_case_for_anomalous_link_discovery","301233236_Clustering_and_preferential_attachment_in_growing_networks","298852493_The_Matthew_Effect_in_Science","288497327_Simrank","285707766_Bipartite_networks_for_link_prediction_Can_they_improve_prediction_performance","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","277815637_The_Matthew_effect_in_science"]}
