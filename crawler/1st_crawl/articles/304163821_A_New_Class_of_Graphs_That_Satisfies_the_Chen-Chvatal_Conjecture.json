{"id":"304163821_A_New_Class_of_Graphs_That_Satisfies_the_Chen-Chvatal_Conjecture","abstract":"A well-known combinatorial theorem says that a set of n non-collinear points in the plane determines at least n distinct lines. Chen and Chv\\'atal conjectured that this theorem extends to metric spaces, with an appropriated definition of line. In this work we prove a slightly stronger version of Chen and Chv\\'atal conjecture for a family of graphs containing chordal graphs and distance-hereditary graphs.","authors":["Pierre Aboulker","Martin Matamala","Paul Rochet","Jose Zamora"],"meta":["June 2016Journal of Graph Theory 87(6)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.22142"],"references":["270222425_Lines_Betweenness_and_Metric_Spaces","221660734_A_De_Bruijn-Erdos_Theorem_for_Chordal_Graphs","51960820_Lines_in_hypergraphs","285909427_Three_point_collinearity_Problem_4065","271738323_A_de_Bruijn-Erdos_theorem_for_1-2_metric_spaces","260340541_Graph_metric_with_no_proper_inclusion_between_lines","259239932_The_Chen-Chv'atal_conjecture_for_metric_spaces_induced_by_distance-hereditary_graphs","257429129_Towards_a_de_Bruijn-Erdos_Theorem_in_the_L_1-Metric","256097260_Number_of_lines_in_hypergraphs","247152244_Introduction_to_Geometry","237128705_A_Combinatorial_Problem","228110121_Graph_Classes_a_Survey","225238362_Unterschungen_uber_Allgemeine_Metrik","225125495_On_rigid_circuit_graphs","224907194_A_De_Bruijn-Erdos_theorem_for_1-2_metric_spaces","220570058_Problems_related_to_a_de_Bruijn-Erdos_theorem","220200530_A_de_Bruijn_-_Erdos_theorem_and_metric_spaces","2524436_Sylvester-Gallai_Theorem_and_Metric_Betweenness"]}
