{"id":"326781482_Clinical_simulation_to_teach_nursing_care_for_wounded_patients","abstract":"Objective: \nto report the experience of constructing and applicating clinical simulation scenarios for the evaluation and treatment of wounds.\n\nMethod: \nexperience report on two simulation scenarios for nursing care of wounded patients applied to nursing undergraduates. We structured simulations based on the model from the National League for Nursing/Jeffries Simulation Framework. The scenarios were evaluated by the instrument Simulation Design Scale and the students by the experience with the simulation.\n\nResults: \nthe scenarios reproduced nursing care situations with the application of role play and moulage, which allowed us to evaluate and discuss the wound treatment. Reflections on the debriefing were important for the teaching-learning process and association between theory and practice, these factors determined the satisfaction of students with the activity.\n\nConclusion: \nusing clinical simulation scenarios to teach students favored the clinical reasoning and decision-making in the evaluation and treatment of wounds.","authors":["Juliany Lino Gomes Silva","Ana Railka de Souza Oliveira-Kumakura"],"meta":["January 2018Revista Brasileira de Enfermagem 71(suppl 4):1785-1790","DOI:10.1590/0034-7167-2017-0170"],"references":["311246645_Casos_de_papel_e_role_play_estrategias_de_aprendizagem_em_enfermagem","287358427_Validation_for_the_portuguese_language_of_the_simulation_design_scale","282775693_Translation_and_adaptation_of_the_bates-jensen_wound_assessment_tool_for_the_Brazilian_culture","312120786_Simulation_in_Nursing_Education_and_Practice","287054511_Assessing_the_use_of_simulated_wounds_in_nurse_education","273523347_Effects_of_Case_Studies_and_Simulated_Patients_on_Students'_Nursing_Care_Plan","221763170_Predictors_of_Knowledge_Gains_Using_Simulation_in_the_Education_of_Prelicensure_Nursing_Students","201381836_Learning_by_Doing_A_Guide_to_Teaching_And_Learning_Methods","24039213_Education_to_bridge_the_quality_gap_A_case_study_approach"]}
