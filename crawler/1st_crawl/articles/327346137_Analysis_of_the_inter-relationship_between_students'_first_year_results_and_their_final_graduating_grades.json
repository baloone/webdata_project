{"id":"327346137_Analysis_of_the_inter-relationship_between_students'_first_year_results_and_their_final_graduating_grades","abstract":"There is a tendency for students to lose focus in tertiary institutions because of change in environment and peer pressure (among several others); hence, a need to monitor and study the trend of students' performance in the tertiary institution. This article, therefore, seeks to know the correlation between the first year results and in particular, the final graduating grade of students in a leading Nigerian University. Test of normality was performed for the final graduating results and multiple linear regression models were fitted to the data; this enables us to predict what a student can graduate with having known a previous result (or first year result). All the analyses were performed using Minitab software. The result established that there are strong linear relationships between the GPAs as a student progresses in his/her academic journey.","authors":["Pelumi Oguntunde","Hilary Okagbue","Omoleye Adedoyin Oguntunde","Abiodun Opanuga"],"meta":["August 2018International Journal of ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES 5(10):1-6","DOI:10.21833/ijaas.2018.10.001"],"references":["323213290_Learning_analytics_Dataset_for_empirical_evaluation_of_entry_requirements_into_engineering_undergraduate_programs_in_a_Nigerian_university","322439526_Learning_attributes_of_summa_cum_laude_students_Experience_of_a_Nigerian_university","322236474_Learning_Analytics_for_Smart_Campus_Data_on_Academic_Performances_of_Engineering_Undergraduates_in_a_Nigerian_Private_University","320646754_High_School_Academic_Performance_and_Academic_Success_in_University","315056685_Item_analysis_of_university-wide_multiple_choice_objective_examinations_the_experience_of_a_Nigerian_private_university","311389143_Correlation_study_of_student_achievement_at_pre-university_level_and_their_corresponding_achievement_in_the_year-one_undergraduate_course_of_circuit_theory_at_UKM","46032264_The_Effect_of_Mode_of_Entry_into_Medical_School_on_Performance_in_the_First_Two_Years","27800866_Relationship_between_Admission_Grades_and_Performances_of_Students_in_the_First_Professional_Examination_in_a_New_Medical_School","287112886_The_predictive_validity_of_Intelligence_Test_M_ML_MQ","235281524_Undergraduate_students'_performance_The_case_of_University_of_Malaya","9080213_Students_admission_grades_and_their_performance_at_Ibadan_University_pre-clinical_MBBS_examinations"]}
