{"id":"3816624_Object_Recognition_from_Local_Scale-Invariant_Features","abstract":"An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new\nclass of local image features. The features are invariant to image\nscaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to\nillumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share\nsimilar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are\nused for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently\ndetected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable\npoints in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local\ngeometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in\nmultiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as\ninput to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate\nobject matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding\na low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters.\nExperimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved\nin cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under\n2 seconds","authors":["David Lowe"],"meta":["February 1999","DOI:10.1109/ICCV.1999.790410","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Computer Vision, 1999.
