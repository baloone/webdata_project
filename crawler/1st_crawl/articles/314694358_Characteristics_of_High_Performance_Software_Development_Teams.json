{"id":"314694358_Characteristics_of_High_Performance_Software_Development_Teams","abstract":"A high performance team is one that exceeds all reasonable expectations and produces extraordinary results. In this work, we are interested in understanding contexts and conditions in which software engineering teams are likely to achieve this status. To this end, we are carrying out a systematic literature review to identify what are the known factors that booster or hinder the performance of software engineering teams and an ad hoc literature review about training approaches in Software Engineering. This paper presents a discussion in relation to current training approaches to software development and their relation to high performance team formation. Based on what was found we reflect on the challenges of high performance teams for software development projects. This work constitutes a key preliminary result towards the design of more elaborate models and theories to predict and explain the performance of software engineering teams.","authors":["Alessandra C.
