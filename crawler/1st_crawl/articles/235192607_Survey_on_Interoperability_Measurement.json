{"id":"235192607_Survey_on_Interoperability_Measurement","abstract":"For nearly thirty years, both government and industry have actively explored research on interoperability measurement with the goal of creating a straightforward way of measuring, reporting, then improving the interoperability of complex networks of people, equipment, processes and organizations. Researchers have created frameworks and models, proposed measures, described levels, and listed a variety of qualitative factors in support of an interoperability measure. Within extant interoperability research, the authors' research has uncovered nearly three dozen definitions of interoperability, over five dozen distinct types of interoperability, numerous interoperability attributes, and fourteen foundational interoperability measurement models and methodologies. At least eleven research groups have been the centers-of-gravity for interoperability measurement research. This survey paper summarizes and focuses the current body of knowledge on interoperability measurement and identifies areas where further research is needed.","authors":["Thomas Ford","John Colombi","Scott R.
