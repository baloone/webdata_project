{"id":"335030823_Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning_Based_Resource_Allocation_for_UAV_Networks","abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of serving as aerial base stations (BSs) for providing both cost-effective and on-demand wireless communications. This article investigates dynamic resource allocation of multiple UAVs enabled communication networks with the goal of maximizing long-term rewards. More particularly, each UAV communicates with a ground user by automatically selecting its communicating user, power level and subchannel without any information exchange among UAVs. To model the dynamics and uncertainty in environments, we formulate the long-term resource allocation problem as a stochastic game for maximizing the expected rewards, where each UAV becomes a learning agent and each resource allocation solution corresponds to an action taken by the UAVs. Afterwards, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that each agent discovers its best strategy according to its local observations using learning. More specifically, we propose an agent-independent method, for which all agents conduct a decision algorithm independently but share a common structure based on Q-learning. Finally, simulation results reveal that: 1) appropriate parameters for exploitation and exploration are capable of enhancing the performance of the proposed MARL based resource allocation algorithm; 2) the proposed MARL algorithm provides acceptable performance compared to the case with complete information exchanges among UAVs. By doing so, it strikes a good tradeoff between performance gains and information exchange overheads.","authors":["Jingjing Cui","Yuanwei Liu","Arumugam Nallanathan"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TWC.2019.2935201","Projects: AI enabled UAV Communications based OMA/NOMAWireless AI"],"references":["331266987_Machine_Learning_for_Predictive_On-Demand_Deployment_of_Uavs_for_Wireless_Communications","327407632_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Based_User_Clustering_in_mmWave-NOMA_Systems","327062769_Airborne_Communication_Networks_A_Survey","323550248_A_Tutorial_on_UAVs_for_Wireless_Networks_Applications_Challenges_and_Open_Problems","322568455_Cellular-Connected_UAVs_over_5G_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Interference_Management","334424879_The_Application_of_Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning_in_UAV_Networks","326486692_3-D_Drone-Cell_Deployment_for_Congestion_Mitigation_in_Cellular_Networks","324096443_An_Asymmetric_Evolutionary_Bayesian_Coalition_Formation_Game_for_Distributed_Resource_Sharing_in_a_Multi-Cell_Device-to-Device_Enabled_Cellular_Network","323715811_College_Admissions_and_the_Stability_of_Marriage","323531138_Distributed_Demand-Aware_Channel-Slot_Selection_for_Multi-UAV_Networks_A_Game-Theoretic_Learning_Approach"]}
