{"id":"252163589_Diagonally_non-recursive_functions_and_effective_Hausdorff_dimension","abstract":"We prove that every sufficiently slow-growing diagonally non-recursive (DNR) function computes a real with effective Hausdorff\ndimension 1. We then show that, for any recursive unbounded and non-decreasing function j, there is a DNR function bounded by j that does not compute a Martin-Löf random real. Hence, there is a real of effective Hausdorff dimension 1 that does not compute\na Martin-Löf random real. This answers a question of Reimann and Terwijn.","authors":["NOAM GREENBERG","JOSEPH S.
