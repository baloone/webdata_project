{"id":"323854016_Trends_in_Graph-based_Representations_for_Pattern_Recognition","abstract":"In this paper we try to examine recent trends on the use of graph-based representations in Pattern Recognition, using as a vantage point the 11th IAPR-TC15 Workshop GbR2017, dedicated to this topic. A survey of the paper presented at GbR2017 will give us the opportunity to reflect on the directions where the interest of the research community working on this subject is moving.","authors":["Luc Brun","Pasquale Foggia","Mario Vento"],"meta":["March 2018Pattern Recognition Letters 134","DOI:10.1016/j.patrec.2018.03.016"],"references":["317204682_An_Edit_Distance_Between_Graph_Correspondences","317203846_A_Hungarian_Algorithm_for_Error-Correcting_Graph_Matching","317155025_Reeb_Graphs_of_Piecewise_Linear_Functions","317154995_Node_Matching_Computation_Between_Two_Large_Graphs_in_Linear_Computational_Cost","317154901_Learning_Graph_Matching_with_a_Graph-Based_Perceptron_in_a_Classification_Context","317068219_A_Survey_on_Applications_of_Bipartite_Graph_Edit_Distance","317068011_Speeding-Up_Graph-Based_Keyword_Spotting_in_Historical_Handwritten_Documents","316627199_Exact_Computation_of_Graph_Edit_Distance_for_Uniform_and_Non-_Uniform_Metric_Edit_Costs","315489554_On_the_Interplay_between_Strong_Regularity_and_Graph_Densification","305696390_Game_Theoretic_Hypergraph_Matching_for_Multi-source_Image_Correspondences","282039004_Learning_SVM_in_Krein_Spaces","273169802_Speeding_up_Fast_Bipartite_Graph_Matching_Through_a_New_Cost_Matrix","262524340_Graph_Matching_and_Learning_in_Pattern_Recognition_in_the_Last_10_Years","236228164_A_Game-Theoretic_Approach_to_Hypergraph_Clustering","221346501_A_generalization_of_Haussler's_convolution_kernel_-_Mapping_kernel","221346345_Structure_preserving_embedding","221275987_Attributed_Graph_Matching_for_Image-Features_Association_Using_SIFT_Descriptors","220538859_Comparing_Stars_On_Approximating_Graph_Edit_Distance","220359794_Thirty_Years_Of_Graph_Matching_In_Pattern_Recognition","317205184_A_Nested_Alignment_Graph_Kernel_Through_the_Dynamic_Time_Warping_Framework","317203795_Introducing_VF3_A_New_Algorithm_for_Subgraph_Isomorphism","317155229_Error-Tolerant_Coarse-to-Fine_Matching_Model_for_Hierarchical_Graphs","317155225_Adaptive_Feature_Selection_Based_on_the_Most_Informative_Graph-Based_Features","317155122_Learning_from_Diffusion-Weighted_Magnetic_Resonance_Images_Using_Graph_Kernels","317155117_Density_Normalization_in_Density_Peak_Based_Clustering","317155027_Mining_Frequent_Patterns_in_2Dt_Grid_Graphs_for_Cellular_Automata_Analysis","317155026_GERoMe_-_A_Novel_Graph_Extraction_Robustness_Measure","317154996_Improved_Graph_Edit_Distance_Approximation_with_Simulated_Annealing","317154977_Synchronization_Over_the_Birkhoff_Polytope_for_Multi-graph_Matching","317154908_Measuring_Vertex_Centrality_Using_the_Holevo_Quantity","317154907_Saliency_Detection_via_A_Graph_Based_Diffusion_Model","317154890_Minimising_Entropy_Changes_in_Dynamic_Network_Evolution","317091324_Fast_Nearest_Neighbors_Search_in_Graph_Space_Based_on_a_Branch-and-Bound_Strategy","316098839_Shape_Simplification_Through_Graph_Sparsification","316098838_Detecting_Alzheimer's_Disease_using_Directed_Graphs","312982120_Centrality_indices","310509383_Exact_Graph_Edit_Distance_Computation_Using_a_Binary_Linear_Program","309273861_Anytime_graph_matching","306942686_Quantum_Kernels_for_Unattributed_Graphs_using_Discrete-time_Quantum_Walks","289569803_On_the_Variable_Ordering_in_Subgraph_Isomorphism_Algorithms","262172151_TurboISO_Towards_ultrafast_and_robust_subgraph_isomorphism_search_in_large_graph_databases","261357339_A_Quantum_Jensen-Shannon_Graph_Kernel_for_Unattributed_Graphs","248654888_A_distance_measure_between_attributed_relational_graph","236110992_Graph_Kernels_from_the_Jensen-Shannon_Divergence","228849377_Bit-vector_algorithms_for_binary_constraint_satisfaction_and_subgraph_isomorphism","225162624_Bipartite_Graph_Matching_for_Computing_the_Edit_Distance_of_Graphs","221996125_Convolution_Kernels_on_Discrete_Structures","220546258_AllDifferent-based_Filtering_for_Subgraph_Isomorphism","50402384_Fast_subtree_kernels_on_graphs","7990921_An_Experimental_Comparison_of_In-CutMax-Flow_Algorithms_for_Energy_Minimization_in_Vision","3358879_Building_irregular_pyramids_by_dual-graph_contraction","3193784_A_SubGraph_Isomorphism_Algorithm_for_Matching_Large_Graphs","2760737_Shock_Graphs_and_Shape_Matching","3684600_Dual_graph_contraction_for_irregular_pyramids","3479333_A_Formal_Basis_for_the_Heuristic_Determination_of_Minimum_Cost_Paths"]}
