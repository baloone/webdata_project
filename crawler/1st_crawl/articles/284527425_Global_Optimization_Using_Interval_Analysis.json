{"id":"284527425_Global_Optimization_Using_Interval_Analysis","abstract":"We give an overview of the general ideas involved in solving global optimization problems using interval analysis. We include a tutorial discussion of a simplified global optimization algorithm for a function of one variable. We discuss common misconceptions about interval analysis and the optimization algorithm.","authors":["Arnold Neumaier","Eldon Hansen"],"meta":["July 1994Mathematics of Computation 63(207):428","DOI:10.2307/2153591"],"references":[]}
