{"id":"307085024_A_New_View_on_Soft_Normed_Spaces","abstract":"In this paper, we work on the structure of soft linear spaces over a field K\nand investigate some of its properties. Here, we use the concept of the soft\npoint which was introduced in [2,6]. We then introduce the soft norm in soft\nlinear spaces. Finally, we examine the properties of this soft normed space and\npresent some investigations about soft continuous operators in the space.","authors":["Murat Ibrahim Yazar","Tunay Bilgin","Sadi Bayramov","Cigdem Gunduz Aras"],"meta":["March 2014International Mathematical Forum 9:1149-1159","DOI:10.12988/imf.2014.4470","Project: Estimation of The Vocational High School Studentsâ€™ Science Courses Academic Achievements With Artificial Neural Network and Precautions to Avoid Failure ( Turkey and Malaysia Comparison)"],"references":["273445510_Soft_linear_operators_in_soft_normed_linear_spaces","273445505_On_soft_inner_product_spaces","273442337_On_soft_metric_space","272027951_Operators_on_Soft_Inner_Product_Spaces","268995256_Soft_real_sets_soft_real_numbers_and_their_properties","255173951_On_soft_linear_spaces_and_soft_normed_linear_spaces","222782394_Soft_set_theory-First_results","220510798_On_some_new_operations_in_soft_set_theory","273445486_Soft_metric","223125792_Soft_set_theory"]}
