{"id":"272422996_Exploring_Hierarchies_in_Online_Social_Networks","abstract":"Social hierarchy (i.e., pyramid structure of societies) is a fundamental\nconcept in sociology and social network analysis. The importance of social\nhierarchy in a social network is that the topological structure of the social\nhierarchy is essential in both shaping the nature of social interactions\nbetween individuals and unfolding the structure of the social networks. The\nsocial hierarchy found in a social network can be utilized to improve the\naccuracy of link prediction, provide better query results, rank web pages, and\nstudy information flow and spread in complex networks. In this paper, we model\na social network as a directed graph G, and consider the social hierarchy as\nDAG (directed acyclic graph) of G, denoted as GD. By DAG, all the vertices in G\ncan be partitioned into different levels, the vertices at the same level\nrepresent a disjoint group in the social hierarchy, and all the edges in DAG\nfollow one direction. The main issue we study in this paper is how to find DAG\nGD in G. The approach we take is to find GD by removing all possible cycles\nfrom G such that G = U(G) + GD where U(G) is a maximum Eulerian subgraph which\ncontains all possible cycles. We give the reasons for doing so, investigate the\nproperties of GD found, and discuss the applications. In addition, we develop a\nnovel two-phase algorithm, called Greedy-&-Refine, which greedily computes an\nEulerian subgraph and then refines this greedy solution to find the maximum\nEulerian subgraph. We give a bound between the greedy solution and the optimal.\nThe quality of our greedy approach is high. We conduct comprehensive\nexperimental studies over 14 real-world datasets. The results show that our\nalgorithms are at least two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline\nalgorithm.","authors":["Can Lu","Jeffrey Xu Yu","Rong-Hua Li","Hao Wei"],"meta":["February 2015IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 28(8)","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2546243","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261672975_Inferring_Social_Status_and_Rich_Club_Effects_in_Enterprise_Communication_Networks","234786222_Growth_of_the_Flickr_social_network","224602523_Inferring_the_Maximum_Likelihood_Hierarchy_in_Social_Networks","221498518_Beating_the_Random_Ordering_is_Hard_Inapproximability_of_Maximum_Acyclic_Subgraph","221022162_Finding_Hierarchy_in_Directed_Online_Social_Networks","220521157_Symmetric-Acyclic_Decompositions_of_Networks","51965551_Jointly_Predicting_Links_and_Inferring_Attributes_using_aSocial-Attribute_Network_SAN","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","281748678_Sampling_from_large_graphs","275632790_Information_and_Influence_Propagation_in_Social_Networks","264960360_Eulerian_graphs_and_related_topics_Part_1_Volume_1","263231815_Information_flow_in_generalized_hierarchical_networks","262352160_Influence_Spread_in_Large-Scale_Social_Networks_-_A_Belief_Propagation_Approach","262154866_Social_influence_locality_for_modeling_retweeting_behaviors","261960711_Who_proposed_the_relationship_-_Recovering_the_hidden_directions_of_undirected_social_networks","253555835_Social_Network_Data_Analytics","250956233_Amortized_Computational_Complexity","248390464_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","238407454_The_Origins_of_Status_Hierarchies_A_Formal_Theory_and_Empirical_Test","237912898_Authoritative_sources_in_a_hyperlinked_environment","230795038_Evolution_of_Social-Attribute_Networks_Measurements_Modeling_andImplications_using_Google","228576227_Information_flow_in_generalized_hierarchical_networks","227656574_Supereulerian_graphs_A_survey","227358961_Spread_of_misInformation_in_social_networks","225932000_Parameterized_Complexity_of_EvenOdd_Subgraph_Problems","225081314_Friendship_networks_and_social_status","221654673_Mining_advisor-advisee_relationships_from_research_publication_networks","220657776_Parameterized_complexity_of_evenodd_subgraph_problems","220193459_On_maximum_number_of_edges_in_a_spanning_eulerian_subgraph","220191652_Some_of_the_many_uses_of_Eulerian_graphs_in_graph_theory_plus_some_applications","214640678_What_Is_Twitter_a_Social_Network_or_a_News_Media","200110781_Sampling_from_large_graphs","51992864_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","45905816_Predicting_Positive_and_Negative_Links_in_Online_Social_Networks","45905811_Signed_Networks_in_Social_Media","45859139_Spread_of_Misinformation_in_Social_Networks","33797689_Approximating_the_maximum_acyclic_subgraph","20218132_Attention_similarity_and_the_identification-Categorization_Relationship","5400591_Hierarchical_structure_and_the_prediction_of_missing_links_in_networks","2930322_The_Link_Prediction_Problem_for_Social_Networks","2454697_Kleinberg_J_Autoritive_success_in_a_hyper_linked_environment_J_ACM_5_604-632"]}
