{"id":"308576265_Newton's_Divided_Difference_Interpolation_formula_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_curve","abstract":"Due to the necessity of a formula for representing a given set of numerical data on a pair of variables by a suitable polynomial, in interpolation by the approach which consists of the representation of numerical data by a suitable polynomial and then to compute the value of the dependent variable from the polynomial corresponding to any given value of the independent variable, one such formula has been derived from Newtonâ€™s divided difference interpolation formula. This paper describes the derivation of the formula with numerical example as its application.","authors":["Biswajit Das","Dhritikesh Chakrabarty"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Mathematics Trends and Technology 35(3):197-203","DOI:10.14445/22315373/IJMTT-V35P528"],"references":["307867699_Lagrange's_Interpolation_Formula_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_curve","315232371_Recurrence_relations_for_computing_with_modified_divided_differences","262358251_A_Remark_on_Divided_Differences","262348629_A_divided_difference_expansion_of_a_divided_difference","242966105_Some_results_on_numerical_divided_difference_formulas","227207554_On_a_characterization_of_polynomials_by_divided_differences","226150978_A_divided_difference_formula_for_the_error_in_Hermite_interpolation","223645379_On_the_divided_differences_of_the_remainder_in_polynomial_interpolation","222556700_Error_formulas_for_divided_difference_expansions_and_numerical_differentiation","31553045_Calculus_of_observations_a_treatise_on_numerical_mathematics"]}
