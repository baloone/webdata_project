{"id":"319630679_A_taxonomy_of_generative_poetry_techniques","abstract":"We describe computer-generated poetry techniques in the categories of mere generation, human enhancement and computer enhancement. We classify the different kinds of algorithm used to create poetry, and argue that the artificial intelligence techniques used by computer scientists are artistically relevant. We also use computer-generated music as an example to show that this three-level taxonomy applies to computational creativity in other fields.","authors":["Carolyn Lamb","Daniel G.
