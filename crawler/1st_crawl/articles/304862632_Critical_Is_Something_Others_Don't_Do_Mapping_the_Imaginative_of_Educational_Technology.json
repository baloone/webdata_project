{"id":"304862632_Critical_Is_Something_Others_Don't_Do_Mapping_the_Imaginative_of_Educational_Technology","abstract":"This book is an outcome of a provocation paper1 prepared by Neil Selwyn (2012) for a conference concerned with critical perspectives on learning with new media. In his paper, Selwyn argued that\nEducation and technology could be classed as an area of scholarship whose time is yet to come … As an area of academic study, education and technology is populated by a transient ragbag of individuals hailing from the learning sciences, social psychology, computer science, teacher education, media studies, sociology and beyond. As such, this is a “mongrel” area of scholarship that suffers from the absence of any long-term collective obligation amongst its participants to develop their “(non)field” of study into anything more than the sum of its parts.
