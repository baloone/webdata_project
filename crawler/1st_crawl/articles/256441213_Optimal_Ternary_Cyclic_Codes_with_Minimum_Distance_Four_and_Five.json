{"id":"256441213_Optimal_Ternary_Cyclic_Codes_with_Minimum_Distance_Four_and_Five","abstract":"Cyclic codes are an important subclass of linear codes and have wide\napplications in data storage systems, communication systems and consumer\nelectronics. In this paper, two families of optimal ternary cyclic codes are\npresented. The first family of cyclic codes has parameters $[3^m-1, 3^m-1-2m,\n4]$ and contains a class of conjectured cyclic codes and several new classes of\noptimal cyclic codes. The second family of cyclic codes has parameters $[3^m-1,\n3^m-2-2m, 5]$ and contains a number of classes of cyclic codes that are\nobtained from perfect nonlinear functions over $\\fthreem$, where $m>1$ and is a\npositive integer.","authors":["Nian Li","Chunlei Li","Tor Helleseth","Cunsheng Ding"],"meta":["September 2013Finite Fields and Their Applications 30","DOI:10.1016/j.ffa.2014.06.001","SourcearXiv"],"references":["236589369_Optimal_Ternary_Cyclic_Codes_From_Monomials","220301087_The_weight_distribution_of_a_class_of_p-ary_cyclic_codes","4332326_Bounds_on_Codes_Based_on_Graph_Theory","257481944_A_q-polynomial_approach_to_cyclic_codes","251093742_Planes_of_order_n_with_collineation_groups_of_order_n_2","246193402_Finite_Fields_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics","226306861_On_cyclic_codes_of_length_with_two_zeros_whose_dual_codes_have_three_weights","220685620_Almost_Perfect_Nonlinear_Power_Functions_in_Odd_Characteristic","220684548_On_the_Weight_Distributions_of_Two_Classes_of_Cyclic_Codes","220682881_Linear_Codes_From_Perfect_Nonlinear_Mappings_and_Their_Secret_Sharing_Schemes","220681342_On_Self-Dual_Cyclic_Codes_Over_Finite_Fields","220638101_Planar_Functions_and_Planes_of_Lenz-Barlotti_Class_II","220301092_Weight_distribution_of_some_reducible_cyclic_codes","51932198_Hamming_Weights_in_Irreducible_Cyclic_Codes","45909380_A_Triple-Error-Correcting_Cyclic_Code_from_the_Gold_and_Kasami-Welch_APN_Power_Functions","3085968_A_New_Bound_for_the_Minimum_Distance_of_a_Cyclic_Code_From_Its_Defining_Set","3085708_The_weight_distribution_of_a_class_of_linear_codes_from_perfect_nonlinear_functions","3079746_New_Families_of_Almost_Perfect_Nonlinear_Power_Mappings"]}
