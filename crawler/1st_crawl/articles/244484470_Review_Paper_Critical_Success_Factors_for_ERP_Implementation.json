{"id":"244484470_Review_Paper_Critical_Success_Factors_for_ERP_Implementation","abstract":"The presented study tried to examine the implication of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) that has been investigated recently by different scholars. The study aimed to propose an inexpensive model for implementing ERP. To achieve the purpose, the experimentally established factors known as critical success factors (CSFs) were described and classified in the review of the literature. Therefore, the result of the study can be viewed as the proposal of an inexpensive model of CSF in implementing ERP. Related tables and appendices were included for each subject matter so that the readers could get familiar with them easier. Also, they can aid scholars for further studies. A comprehensive bibliography with a full description of the cited materials was also included in this study.","authors":["Mahyar Amini","Nazli Sadat Safavi"],"meta":["April 2013SSRN Electronic Journal Volume 5(Issue 16):pp. 1-23","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2256382"],"references":["254839100_Program_Management_and_Complexity_of_ERP_Implementations","233676353_Lessons_from_enterprise_resource_planning_implementations_in_Ireland_-_Towards_smaller_and_shorter_ERP_projects","280016921_Enterprise_resource_planning_survey_of_US_manufacturing_firms","263136681_A_Model_of_ERP_Project_Implementation","262404979_An_innovation-diffusion_view_of_implementation_of_ERP_systems_and_development_of_a_research_model","251005666_Market_Reaction_to_ERP_Implementation_Announcements","239249351_Enterprise_resource_planning_survey_of_Korean_manufacturing_firms","233694405_Implementing_enterprise_resource_planning_packages_in_different_corporate_and_national_cultures","233681020_Learning_from_Adopters'_Experiences_with_ERP_Problems_Encountered_and_Success_Achieved","233620963_Risk_Factors_in_Enterprise-WideERP_Projects"]}
