{"id":"284798112_Classical_quantum_and_biological_randomness_as_relative_unpredictability","abstract":"We propose the thesis that randomness is unpredictability with respect to an intended theory and measurement. From this point of view we briefly discuss various forms of randomness that physics, mathematics and computing science have proposed. Computing science allows to discuss unpredictability in an abstract, yet very expressive way, which yields useful hierarchies of randomness and may help to relate its various forms in natural sciences. Finally we discuss biological randomness—its peculiar nature and role in ontogenesis and in evolutionary dynamics (phylogenesis). Randomness in biology has a positive character as it contributes to the organisms’ and populations’ structural stability by adaptation and diversity.","authors":["Cristian S.
