{"id":"285291463_Big_Data_in_the_Public_Sector_Lessons_for_Practitioners_and_Scholars","abstract":"In this essay, we consider the role of Big Data in the public sector. Motivating our work is the recognition that Big Data is still in its infancy and many important questions regarding the true value of Big Data remain unanswered. The question we consider is as follows: What are the limits, or potential, of Big Data in the public sector? By reviewing the literature and summarizing insights from a series of interviews from public sector Chief Information Officers (CIOs), we offer a scholarly foundation for both practitioners and researchers interested in understanding Big Data in the public sector.","authors":["Kevin C.
