The problem of finding such locally finite decompositions is shown to be equivalent to solving certain matrix equations involving two-slanted matrices. These relations may be reinterpreted in terms of banded matrices possessing banded inverses. Our approach to solving the matrix equations is based on factorization techniques which work under certain conditions on minors. In particular, we apply these results to univariate splines with arbitrary knot sequences.","authors":["Wolfgang Dahmen","Charles A.
