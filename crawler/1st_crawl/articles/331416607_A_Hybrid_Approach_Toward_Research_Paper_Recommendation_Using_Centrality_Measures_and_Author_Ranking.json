{"id":"331416607_A_Hybrid_Approach_Toward_Research_Paper_Recommendation_Using_Centrality_Measures_and_Author_Ranking","abstract":"The volume of research articles in digital repositories is increasing. This spectacular growth of repositories makes it rather difficult for researchers to obtain related research papers in response to their queries. The problem becomes worse when a researcher with insufficient knowledge of searching research articles uses these repositories. In the traditional recommendation approaches, the results of the query misses many high-quality papers, in the related work section, which are either published recently or have low citation count. To overcome this problem, there needs to be a solution which considers not only structural relationships between the papers but also inspects the quality of authors publishing those articles. Many research paper recommendation approaches have been implemented which includes collaborative filtering based, content based and citation analysis based techniques. The collaborative filtering based approaches primarily use paper-citation matrix for recommendations whereas content-based approaches only consider the content of the paper. Citation analysis considers structure of the citation network and focuses on papers citing or cited by the paper of interest (PoI). It is therefore very difficult for a recommender system to recommend high quality papers without a hybrid approach that incorporates multiple features such as citation information and author information. The proposed method creates multilevel citation and relationship network of authors in which citation network uses structural relationship between papers to extract significant papers and authors collaboration network finds key authors from those papers. The papers selected by this hybrid approach are then recommended to the user. The results have shown that our proposed approach performs exceedingly well as compared to the state-of-the-art existing systems such as Google Scholar and Multilevel Simultaneous Citation Network (MSCN).","authors":["Waleed Waheed","Muhammad Imran","Basit Raza","Ahmad Kamran Malik"],"meta":["February 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900520","Project: Mining Social Media data"],"references":["320252671_A_collaborative_approach_for_research_paper_recommender_system","316335322_The_nearly_universal_link_between_the_age_of_past_knowledge_and_tomorrow's_breakthroughs_in_science_and_technology_The_hotspot","313671612_Citation-based_clustering_of_publications_using_CitNetExplorer_and_VOSviewer","286441319_User_Preference_Modeling_by_Global_and_Individual_Weights_for_Personalized_Recommendation","282313677_Context-Based_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Citation_Recommendation","280576923_Research-paper_recommender_systems_A_literature_survey","265842985_Content-based_citation_analysis_The_next_generation_of_citation_analysis","264799812_Content-based_citation_analysis_The_next_generation_of_citation_analysis","262940443_Co-Authorship_and_Bibliographic_Coupling_Network_Effects_on_Citations","262398831_Research_paper_recommender_system_evaluation_A_quantitative_literature_survey","242104348_Item-based_top-_N_recommendation_algorithms","234144778_Mendeley_Creating_Communities_of_Scholarly_Inquiry_Through_Research_Collaboration","224059116_Google_Scholar's_Ranking_Algorithm_The_Impact_of_Citation_Counts_An_Empirical_Study","220923902_Scholarly_paper_recommendation_via_user's_recent_research_interests","220349062_Creating_Links_into_the_Future","200610399_Scienstein_A_Research_Paper_Recommender_System","200610388_Google_Scholar's_Ranking_Algorithm_An_Introductory_Overview","51986580_ArnetMiner_Extraction_and_Mining_of_Academic_Social_Networks","326705010_User_Profile_Based_Paper_Recommendation_System","324634163_Query_Expansion_with_Neural_Question-to-Answer_Translation_for_FAQ-based_Question_Answering","323392371_Content-Based_Citation_Recommendation","320574165_Academic_paper_recommender_system_using_multilevel_simultaneous_citation_networks","319056299_Information_Sciences_1968-2016_A_retrospective_analysis_with_text_mining_and_bibliometric","318314452_Bibliometrics_of_social_media_research_A_co-citation_and_co-word_analysis","301762610_Paper_recommendation_based_on_the_knowledge_gap_between_a_researcher's_background_knowledge_and_research_target","294286311_Recommender_Systems_Introduction_and_Challenges","289744103_RefSeer_A_citation_recommendation_system","271680793_Topical_connections_between_the_institutions_within_an_organisation_institutional_co-authorships_direct_citation_links_and_co-citations","267026585_Diversifying_Search_Results","256091000_Dimensions_as_Virtual_Items_Improving_the_predictive_ability_of_top-N_recommender_systems","248484602_Node_Centrality_in_Weighted_Networks_Generalizing_Degree_and_Shortest_Paths","221175799_Finding_Related_Papers_in_Literature_Digital_Libraries","220515689_Cumulated_Gain-Based_Evaluation_of_IR_Techniques","2464887_CiteSeer_An_Autonomous_Web_Agent_for_Automatic_Retrieval_and_Identification_of_Interesting_Publications"]}
