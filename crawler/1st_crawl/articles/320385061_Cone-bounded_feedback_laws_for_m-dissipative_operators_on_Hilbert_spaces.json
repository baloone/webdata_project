{"id":"320385061_Cone-bounded_feedback_laws_for_m-dissipative_operators_on_Hilbert_spaces","abstract":"This work studies the influence of some constraints on a stabilizing feedback law. An abstract nonlinear control system is considered for which we assume that there exists a linear feedback law that makes the origin of the closed-loop system globally asymptotically stable. This controller is then modified via a cone-bounded nonlinearity. Well-posedness and stability theorems are stated. The first theorem is proved thanks to the Schauder fixed-point theorem and the second one with an infinite-dimensional version of LaSalleâ€™s invariance principle. These results are illustrated on a linear Korteweg-de Vries equation by some simulations and on a nonlinear heat equation.","authors":["Swann Marx","Vincent Andrieu","Christophe Prieur"],"meta":["October 2017Mathematics of Control Signals and Systems 29(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00498-017-0205-x","Project: Analysis of infinite-dimensional systems with saturating control"],"references":["308324712_Global_Stabilization_of_a_Korteweg--De_Vries_Equation_With_Saturating_Distributed_Control","305844918_Stabilization_of_collocated_systems_by_nonlinear_boundary_control","281401779_Stabilization_of_a_linear_Korteweg-de_Vries_equation_with_a_saturated_internal_control","274012347_Global_stabilization_of_multiple_integrators_by_a_bounded_feedback_with_constraints_on_its_successive_derivatives","266999150_Control_of_a_Korteweg-de_Vries_equation_A_tutorial","316799413_Stability_and_Stabilization_of_Linear_Systems_with_Saturating_Actuators","306107414_Nonlinear_systems","291388721_Wave_Equation_With_Cone-Bounded_Control_Laws","286576247_Modern_Anti-Windup_Synthesis_Control_Augmentation_for_Actuator_Saturation","270411119_Port-Hamiltonian_Systems_Theory_An_Introductory_Overview"]}
