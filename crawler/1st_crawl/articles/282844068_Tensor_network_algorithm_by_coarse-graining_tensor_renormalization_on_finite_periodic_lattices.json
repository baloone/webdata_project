{"id":"282844068_Tensor_network_algorithm_by_coarse-graining_tensor_renormalization_on_finite_periodic_lattices","abstract":"We develop coarse-graining tensor renormalization group algorithms to compute\nphysical properties of two-dimensional lattice models on finite periodic\nlattices. Two different coarse-graining strategies, one based on the tensor\nrenormalization group and the other based on the higher-order tensor\nrenormalization group, are introduced. In order to optimize the tensor-network\nmodel globally, a sweeping scheme is proposed to account for the\nrenormalization effect from the environment tensors under the framework of\nsecond renormalization group. We demonstrate the algorithms by the classical\nIsing model on the square lattice and the Kitaev model on the honeycomb\nlattice, and show that the finite-size algorithms achieve substantially more\naccurate results than the corresponding infinite-size ones.","authors":["Hui Hai Zhao","Z Y Xie","Tao Xiang","Masatoshi Imada"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.93.125115","SourcearXiv"],"references":["250918085_Tensor_Renormalization_of_Quantum_Many-Body_Systems_Using_Projected_Entangled_Simplex_States","1823421_Two-Dimensional_Tensor_Product_Variational_Formulation","234984501_Dimers_on_a_Rectangular_Lattice","225492122_Quantum_phase_transition_in_spin-32_systems_on_the_hexagonal_lattice_-_Optimum_ground_state_approach","200104426_Exactly_Solved_Models_in_Statistical_Mechanics","38330232_Valence_bond_ground_states_in_isotropic_quantum_antiferromagnets","5915720_Tensor_Renormalization_Group_Approach_to_Two-Dimensional_Classical_Lattice_Models"]}
