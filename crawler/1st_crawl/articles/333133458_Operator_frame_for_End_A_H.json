{"id":"333133458_Operator_frame_for_End_A_H","abstract":"Frames generalize orthonormal bases and allow representation of all the elements of the space. Frames play significant role in signal and image processing, which leads to many applications in informatics, engineering, medicine, and probability. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of operator frame for the space End * A (H) of all adjointable operators on a Hilbert A-module H and establish some results.","authors":["Rossafi Mohamed","Samir Kabbaj"],"meta":["January 2019","Projects: Gabor Frames and Shift-invariant Spaces- Sur une extension des Frames aux A-modules de Hilbert"],"references":["266001922_-Frames_in_Hilbert_C_-modules","259819151_On_Frames_for_Countably_Generated_Hilbert_C-Modules","225180017_Frames_and_bases_in_tensor_products_of_Hilbert_spaces_and_Hilbert_C-modules","220514619_Fusion_Frames_and_G-Frames_in_Hilbert_C-Modules","265329156_Inner_Product_Modules_Over_B_-Algebras","248786774_Modules_Over_Operator_Algebras","246377327_Hilbert_C-modules_a_toolkit_for_operator_algebraists","244954656_A_Course_in_Operator_Theory","200524234_A_Class_of_Nonharmonic_Fourier_Series","200524207_An_Introduction_to_Frames_and_Riesz_Bases"]}
