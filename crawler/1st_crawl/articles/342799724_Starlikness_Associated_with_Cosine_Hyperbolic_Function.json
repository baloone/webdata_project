{"id":"342799724_Starlikness_Associated_with_Cosine_Hyperbolic_Function","abstract":"The main contribution of this article is to define a family of starlike functions associated with a cosine hyperbolic function. We investigate convolution conditions, integral preserving properties, and coefficient sufficiency criteria for this family. We also study the differential subordinations problems which relate the Janowski and cosine hyperbolic functions. Furthermore, we use these results to obtain sufficient conditions for starlike functions connected with cosine hyperbolic function.","authors":["Abdullah Alotaibi","Muhammad Arif","Mohammed A.
