{"id":"260557726_A_diagnostic_ontological_model_for_damages_to_historical_constructions","abstract":"Understanding damages to cultural heritage represents a very complex task based on a multidisciplinary interpretation of gathered information. Integrating the knowledge of different branches of science related to cultural heritage protection into a comprehensive knowledge-based system allows endorsing professional decision-making processes with the particular scope to mitigate the challenge posed by damage diagnosis to both expert and non-expert users. This paper proposes a model attempting to convey the benefits of modern ontological know-how to the management and processing of information concerning the diagnostic phase. The methodology consists in translating the professional approach to diagnosis of damages into a computer readable form able to replicate the assessment procedure, step by step, towards a feasible intervention. An overview of possible applications to conservation practice, such as the development of a mobile application dedicated to damage surveying and assessment, is also presented.","authors":["Riccardo Cacciotti","Miroslav Blasko","Jaroslav Valach"],"meta":["March 2014Journal of Cultural Heritage 16(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.culher.2014.02.002","Project: MONDIS"],"references":["265074487_Ontology-based_access_to_digitized_cultural_heritage_and_archival_collections","240290981_The_CIDOC_CRM_-_an_Ontological_Approach_to_Semantic_Interoperability_of_Metadata","226398416_Ontologies_for_Cultural_Heritage","319393573_OWL_2_Web_Ontology_Language_Structural_Specification_and_Functional-Style_Syntax","300347979_What_Is_Forensic_Engineering","287585749_Understanding_building_failures_fourth_edition","287585576_Understanding_building_failures_Third_edition","273750256_Forensic_Engineering_Awards","248545703_General_methodology_for_the_structural_restoration_of_historic_buildings_The_cases_of_the_Tower_of_Pisa_and_the_Basilica_of_Assisi","236376791_Monument_Damage_Ontology","220605375_The_CIDOC_Conceptual_Reference_Module_An_Ontological_Approach_to_Semantic_Interoperability_of_Metadata","220351101_Reasoning_with_large_ontologies_stored_in_relational_databases_The_OntoMinD_approach","215500471_Linked_Data_Evolving_the_Web_into_a_Global_Data_Space"]}
