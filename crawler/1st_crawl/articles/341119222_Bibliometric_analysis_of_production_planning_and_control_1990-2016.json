{"id":"341119222_Bibliometric_analysis_of_production_planning_and_control_1990-2016","abstract":"Production Planning and Control (PPC) has been one of the primary publishing outlets for operations management research for nearly three decades. This paper presents bibliometric analysis of the journal from its inception through 2016. PPC was analysed from six different perspectives to provide reliable and in-depth information about the journal’s performance and development. The analysis considered the development of the journal itself, the countries of contributing authors, authors’ academic and practitioner organisation affiliations, the top publishing and most cited authors, the most cited articles, and finally the topics of published papers through analysis of titles, keywords and abstracts. It was found that the journal is considered an outlet for both practice and academic research, reflecting changes over time in the landscape of operations management.","authors":["Adeel Akmal","Natasha Podgorodnichenko","Richard Greatbanks","André M.
