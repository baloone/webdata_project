{"id":"345376013_Electronic_Structure_Basic_Theory_and_Practical_Methods","abstract":"The study of the electronic structure of materials is at a momentous stage, with new computational methods and advances in basic theory. Many properties of materials can be determined from the fundamental equations, and electronic structure theory is now an integral part of research in physics, chemistry, materials science, and other fields. This book provides a unified exposition of the theory and methods, with emphasis on understanding each essential component.\nNew in the second edition are recent advances in density functional theory, an introduction to Berry phases and topological insulators explained in terms of elementary band theory, and many new examples of applications.\nGraduate students and research scientists will find careful explanations with references to original papers, pertinent reviews, and accessible books. Each chapter includes a short list of the most relevant works and exercises that reveal salient points and challenge the reader.","authors":["Richard Martin"],"meta":["August 2020","DOI:10.1017/9781108555586","ISBN: 9781108429900"],"references":["243492311_Kronig-Penney_model_with_the_tail-cancellation_method"]}
