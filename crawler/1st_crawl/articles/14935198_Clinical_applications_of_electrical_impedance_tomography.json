{"id":"14935198_Clinical_applications_of_electrical_impedance_tomography","abstract":"This article is a preliminary review of the possible clinical applications of electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The applications to, for example, the central nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular and digestive systems are covered. It is concluded that the area of greatest potential application of EIT is monitoring cardiopulmonary function, but that studies on much larger groups of patients than have been carried out hitherto are required to fully assess the potential of EIT as a clinical tool.","authors":["A M Dijkstra","B H Brown","A D Leathard","N.
