{"id":"342119578_DNA_steganography_hiding_undetectable_secret_messages_within_the_single_nucleotide_polymorphisms_of_a_genome_and_detecting_mutation-induced_errors","abstract":"Background: \nAs cell engineering technology advances, more complex synthetically designed cells and metabolically engineered cells are being developed. Engineered cells are important resources in industry. Similar to image watermarking, engineered cells should be watermarked for protection against improper use.\n\nResults: \nIn this study, a DNA steganography methodology was developed to hide messages in variable regions (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of the genome to create hidden messages and thereby prevent from hacking. Additionally, to detect errors (mutations) within the encrypted messages, a block sum check algorithm was employed, similar to that used in network data transmission to detect noise-induced information changes.\n\nConclusions: \nThis DNA steganography methodology could be used to hide secret messages in a genome and detect errors within the encrypted messages. This approach is expected to be useful for tracking cells and protecting biological assets (e.g., engineered cells).","authors":["Dokyun Na"],"meta":["June 2020Microbial Cell Factories 19(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12934-020-01387-0"],"references":["335399289_Recent_Advances_on_Biocatalysis_and_Metabolic_Engineering_for_Biomanufacturing","284754840_The_Dfam_database_of_repetitive_DNA_families","230865059_Binary_DNA_Nanostructures_for_Data_Encryption","51160497_Genomic_Polymorphisms_as_Inherent_Watermarks_for_Tracking_Infectious_Agents","332997415_Molecular_digital_data_storage_using_DNA","325182467_Next-generation_biocontainment_systems_for_engineered_organisms","312507660_Commercializing_synthetic_biology_Socio-ethical_concerns_and_challenges_under_intellectual_property_regime","220687895_The_Design_of_Rijndael_AES_-_The_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220426289_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems"]}
