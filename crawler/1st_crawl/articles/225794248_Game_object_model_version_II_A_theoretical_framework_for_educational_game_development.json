{"id":"225794248_Game_object_model_version_II_A_theoretical_framework_for_educational_game_development","abstract":"Complex computer and video games may provide a vehicle, based on appropriate theoretical concepts, to transform the educational\nlandscape. Building on the original game object model (GOM) a new more detailed model is developed to support concepts that\neducational computer games should: be relevant, explorative, emotive, engaging, and include complex challenges; support authentic\nlearning activities that are designed as narrative social spaces where learners are transformed through exploration of multiple\nrepresentation, and reflection; be gender-inclusive, include non-confrontational outcomes, and provide appropriate role models;\ndevelop democracy, and social capital through dialogue that is supported by means of computer mediated-communication tools;\nand include challenges, puzzles or quests, which form the core of the learning process, where access to explicit knowledge,\nconversations, and reflection results in the construction of tacit knowledge. It is argued that the GOM version II can be\nused not only to support the development of educational computer games but to provide a mechanism to evaluate the use of computer\ngames in the classroom.","authors":["Alan Amory"],"meta":["February 2007Educational Technology Research and Development 55(1):51-77","DOI:10.1007/s11423-006-9001-x"],"references":["333584803_Constructivism_in_Cognitive_Film_Theory","325607774_Engaging_Learning_Designing_e-Learning_Simulation_Games","324378188_Creating_a_Role","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","315099795_Interactive_Learning_Systems","313632455_Designing_educational_computer_games","313168128_Building_an_educational_adventure_game_Theory_design_and_lessons","289669224_Personal_computer_adventure_games","286387197_Design_principles_of_next-generation_digital_gaming_for_education","277048994_Use_of_constructivism_in_the_development_and_evaluation_of_an_educational_game_environment","273947296_The_Art_of_Computer_Game_Design","271941003_Games_and_the_Design_of_Human-Computer_Interfaces","271706555_Video_Games_in_Education","270376473_The_Anthropology_of_Sport_An_Introduction","270120441_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience"]}
