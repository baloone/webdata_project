The questions, which have been asked several times (e.g., [Marx08, FGMS12, DF13]), are whether there is a non-trivial FPT-approximation algorithm for the Maximum Clique (Clique) and Minimum Dominating Set (DomSet) problems parameterized by the size of the optimal solution. In particular, letting $\\text{OPT}$ be the optimum and $N$ be the size of the input, is there an algorithm that runs in $t(\\text{OPT})\\text{poly}(N)$ time and outputs a solution of size $f(\\text{OPT})$, for any functions $t$ and $f$ that are independent of $N$ (for Clique, we want $f(\\text{OPT})=\\omega(1)$)? In this paper, we show that both Clique and DomSet admit no non-trivial FPT-approximation algorithm, i.e., there is no $o(\\text{OPT})$-FPT-approximation algorithm for Clique and no $f(\\text{OPT})$-FPT-approximation algorithm for DomSet, for any function $f$ (e.g., this holds even if $f$ is the Ackermann function). In fact, our results imply something even stronger: The best way to solve Clique and DomSet, even approximately, is to essentially enumerate all possibilities. Our results hold under the Gap Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) [Dinur16, MR16], which states that no $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm can distinguish between a satisfiable 3SAT formula and one which is not even $(1 - \\epsilon)$-satisfiable for some constant $\\epsilon > 0$. Besides Clique and DomSet, we also rule out non-trivial FPT-approximation for Maximum Balanced Biclique, Maximum Subgraphs with Hereditary Properties, and Maximum Induced Matching in bipartite graphs. Additionally, we rule out $k^{o(1)}$-FPT-approximation algorithm for Densest $k$-Subgraph although this ratio does not yet match the trivial $O(k)$-approximation algorithm.","authors":["Parinya Chalermsook","Marek Cygan","Guy Kortsarz","Bundit Laekhanukit"],"meta":["August 2017","Project: A Fine-grained Study of NP-hard problems"],"references":["345216837_The_Constant_Inapproximability_of_the_Parameterized_Dominating_Set_Problem","321354209_Bi-Covering_Covering_Edges_with_Two_Small_Subsets_of_Vertices","321066645_From_Gap-ETH_to_FPT-Inapproximability_Clique_Dominating_Set_and_More","321066381_Exponentially-Hard_Gap-CSP_and_Local_PRG_via_Local_Hardcore_Functions","321025242_Completely_inapproximable_monotone_and_antimonotone_parameterized_problems","317639575_Almost-polynomial_ratio_ETH-hardness_of_approximating_densest_k-subgraph","314808119_Relations_between_average_case_complexity_and_approximation_complexity","313185557_On_the_complexity_of_approximating_the_independent_set_problem","312444359_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Label_Cover_and_The_Log-Density_Threshold","312079573_ETH_Hardness_for_Densest-_k_-Subgraph_with_Perfect_Completeness"]}
