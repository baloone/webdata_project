{"id":"221345848_A_unified_architecture_for_natural_language_processing_Deep_neural_networks_with_multitask_learning","abstract":"We describe a single convolutional neural net- work architecture that, given a sentence, out- puts a host of language processing predic- tions: part-of-speech tags, chunks, named en- tity tags, semantic roles, semantically similar words and the likelihood that the sentence makes sense (grammatically and semanti- cally) using a language model. The entire network is trained jointly on all these tasks using weight-sharing, an instance of multitask learning. All the tasks use labeled data ex- cept the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks. We show how both multitask learning and semi-supervised learning improve the general- ization of the shared tasks, resulting in state- of-the-art performance.","authors":["Ronan Collobert","Jason Weston"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1145/1390156.1390177","SourceDBLP","Conference: Machine Learning, Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference (ICML 2008), Helsinki, Finland, June 5-9, 2008"],"references":["262408350_Effective_self-training_for_parsing","241135132_Robust_Parsing_of_the_Proposition_Bank","221618573_A_Neural_Probabilistic_Language_Model","220874969_A_discriminative_language_model_with_Pseudo-negative_samples","220873538_Transductive_learning_for_statistical_machine_translation","220873220_Using_Corpus_Statistics_on_Entities_to_Improve_Semi-supervised_Relation_Extraction_from_the_Web","220817505_Shallow_Semantic_Parsing_using_Support_Vector_Machines","3175480_Phoneme_recognition_using_time-delay_neural_networks","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","2522500_Connectionist_Language_Modeling_For_Large_Vocabulary_Continuous_Speech_Recognition","2413241_A_Neural_Probabilistic_Language_Model","262406121_Dynamic_Conditional_Random_Fields_Factorized_Probabilistic_Models_for_Labeling_and_Segmenting_Sequence_Data","246586038_Joint_Parsing_and_Semantic_Role_Labeling","230875884_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_Feedforward_Classification_Network_Outputs_with_Relationships_to_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition","225818196_Neural_Probabilistic_Language_Models","220873558_Fast_Semantic_Extraction_Using_a_Novel_Neural_Network_Architecture","220817670_Composition_of_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Transfer_Learning","220319924_A_Framework_for_Learning_Predictive_Structures_from_Multiple_Tasks_and_Unlabeled_Data","220017689_The_Proposition_Bank_An_Annotated_Corpus_of_Semantic_Roles","2540346_The_Necessity_of_Parsing_for_Predicate_Argument_Recognition","2371584_Transductive_Inference_for_Text_Classification_Using_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
