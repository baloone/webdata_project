{"id":"250969195_On_insecurity_of_cryptosystems_based_on_generalized_Reed-Solomon_codes","abstract":"In papers [1, 2] methods of building public-key cryptosystems based on code-theoretic constructions have been suggested. Their background is an (s + 1) x N non-secret matrix B of the form B with its elements from a finite field F q. Here B is some unknown matrix which is a check matrix of a q-ary generalized Reed-Solomon code. In this paper we suggest a method of finding the unknown matrices H, B which determines the matrix B in O (s4 + sN) arithmetical operations in Fq. By this the insecurity of such public-key cryptosystems is demonstrated.","authors":["V. M. SIDELNIKOV","S. O.
