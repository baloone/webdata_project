{"id":"250893023_Symmetric_stochastic_integrals_with_respect_to_p-adic_Brownian_motion","abstract":"In this paper, we consider complex-valued Brownian motion with p-adic time index and the associated abstract Wiener space. We define symmetric stochastic integrals with respect to p-adic Brownian motion. We also provide a sufficient condition for the existence of symmetric stochastic integrals and present a relation to the adjoint of the Malliavin derivatives.","authors":["Kenji Kamizono"],"meta":["December 2007Stochastics An International Journal of Probability and Stochastic Processes 79(6):523-538","DOI:10.1080/17442500701433756"],"references":["242388658_Stochastic_integration_with_respect_to_the_fractional_Brownian_motion","266982644_Ito-Wiener_expansions_of_holomorphic_functions_on_the_complex_Wiener_space","258267386_Generalized_functions_over_p-adic_number_field","255482463_Brownian_Motion_and_Stochastic_Calculus","243040674_P-adic_Brownian_motion"]}
