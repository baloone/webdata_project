{"id":"319933942_Medicine_neurosciences_and_interdisciplinarity","abstract":"In terms of fundamental, universal scientific progress in the area of “hard sciences,” the past century was the one of relativity, quantum mechanics, and solid state/surface physics, whereas the 21st century prospects a focus on genomics/life/brain sciences, computer sciences/artificial intelligence, climate, and extraplanetary research. Among these, neurosciences represent a meta-plane, where new tools and insights provide key contributions to revolutionizing our current understandings. Increasingly, we move toward a quantitative description of various neural phenomena as well as to a new understanding of the nervous system and brain organization/functioning in particular. All this is strongly influencing the way we see the world. From this process, finally yet importantly, we derive large benefits for the cure of diseases as well as the management of an aging society.","authors":["Maurice Campagna"],"meta":["June 2017Clinical and Translational Neuroscience 1(1):2514183X1771411","DOI:10.1177/2514183X17714117"],"references":["291341309_On_the_road_to_replication","291340980_The_awesome_lysosome"]}
