{"id":"320672731_Shared_Memory_Parallelism_for_3D_Cartesian_Discrete_Ordinates_Solver","abstract":"This paper describes the design and the performance of DOMINO, a 3D Cartesian SN solver that implements two nested levels of parallelism (multicore + SIMD) on shared memory computation nodes. DOMINO is written in C++, a multi-paradigm programming language that enables the use of powerful andgeneric parallel programming tools such as Intel TBB and Eigen. These two libraries allow us to combine multi-thread parallelism with vector operations in an efficient and yet portable way. As a result, DOMINO can exploit the full power of modern multi-core processors and is able to tackle very large simulations, that usually require large HPC clusters, using a single computing node. For example, DOMINO solves a 3D full core PWR eigenvalue problem involving 26 energy groups, 288 angular directions (S16), 46 x 10^6 spatial cells and 1 x 10^12 DoFs within 11 h on a single 32-core SMP node. This represents a sustained performance of 235 GFlops and 40.74% of the SMP node peak performance for the DOMINO sweep implementation. The very high Flops/Watt ratio of DOMINO makes it a very interesting building block for a future many-nodes nuclear simulation tool.","authors":["Salli Moustafa","Ivan Dutka-Malen","Laurent Plagne","Angélique Ponçot"],"meta":["August 2015Annals of Nuclear Energy 82:179-187","DOI:10.1016/j.anucene.2014.08.034","Project: DOMINO"],"references":["282991758_3D_Neutron_Transport_and_HPC_A_PWR_Full_Core_Calculation_Using_PENTRAN_Sn_Code_and_IBM_BLUEGENEP_Computers","236517630_Unconditionally_Stable_Diffusion-Synthetic_Acceleration_Methods_for_the_Slab_Geometry_Discrete_Ordinates_Equations_Part_I_Theory","236439989_Solution_of_the_first-order_form_of_the_3-D_discrete_ordinates_equations_on_a_massively_parallel_machine","232393391_A_three-dimensional_SN_high-order_diamond_differencing_discretization_with_a_consistent_acceleration_scheme"]}
