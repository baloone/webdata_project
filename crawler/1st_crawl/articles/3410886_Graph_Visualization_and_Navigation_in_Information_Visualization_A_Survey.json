{"id":"3410886_Graph_Visualization_and_Navigation_in_Information_Visualization_A_Survey","abstract":"This is a survey on graph visualization and navigation techniques,\nas used in information visualization. Graphs appear in numerous\napplications such as Web browsing, state-transition diagrams, and data\nstructures. The ability to visualize and to navigate in these\npotentially large, abstract graphs is often a crucial part of an\napplication. Information visualization has specific requirements, which\nmeans that this survey approaches the results of traditional graph\ndrawing from a different perspective","authors":["I.
