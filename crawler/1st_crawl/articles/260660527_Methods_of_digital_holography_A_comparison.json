{"id":"260660527_Methods_of_digital_holography_A_comparison","abstract":"Optically generated holograms can be recorded on CCD-arrays if the\nsampling theorem is obeyed. The digitized and quantized holograms are\nprocessed digitally for the reconstruction of intensity and phase of the\nreal or virtual image. This digital reconstruction consists in a\nnumerical realization of the diffraction integral One approach is the\nFresnel approximation employing a single Fourier transform, the other is\nthe interpretation of the diffraction formula as a convolution integral\nand calculation of this convolution by a double or triple Fourier\ntransform. In this convolution approach the impulse response of free\nspace propagation has to be defined which is then Fourier transformed or\nthe free space transfer function is defined immediately. Impulse\nresponse as well as transfer function can be defined exactly or in an\napproximated version. The main difference between the Fresnel and the\nconvolution approach is the different size of the resulting images.\nFurthermore in the Fresnel case this size depends on the wavelength and\nthe distance of the object from the CCD, in the other case it does not.\nIn this paper consequences on the reconstructed wavefields and on the\ninterference phase distributions of holographic interferometry are\nindicated and demonstrated by experimental results.","authors":["Thomas Kreis","Mike Adams","Werner P.
