In a first step, a dense oversegmentation of the image is created with an Eikonal-based algorithm. The proposed superpixel algorithm ourperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on classical metrics. In a second step, the semi-supervised segmentation is performed on the underlying Region Adjacency Graph created from the oversegmentation. As the complexity is greatly reduced, the organ segmentation can be performed in real-time.","authors":["Pierre Buyssens","Isabelle Gardin","Su Ruan"],"meta":["February 2014IRBM 35(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.irbm.2013.12.007"],"references":["225069465_SLIC_Superpixels_Compared_to_State-of-the-Art_Superpixel_Methods","51784696_Clinical_Feasibility_of_Fast_3-Dimensional_Dosimetry_of_the_Liver_for_Treatment_Planning_of_Hepatocellular_Carcinoma_with_Y-90-Microspheres","47523356_Geodesic_Methods_in_Computer_Vision_and_Graphics","38015406_TurboPixels_Fast_Superpixels_Using_Geometric_Flows","4243554_Medical_Image_Segmentation_Using_K-Means_Clustering_and_Improved_Watershed_Algorithm","276948753_Safety_of_Donors_in_Live_Donor_Liver_Transplantation_Using_Right_Lobe_Grafts","263069512_Energy_Partitions_and_Image_Segmentation_Special_Issue_on_Mathematics_and_Image_Analysis","242529755_A_short_introduction_to_the_art_of_programming","238698667_Preliminary_report_of_the_CAD_system_co_mpetition_in_liver_cancer_extraction_from_3D_CT_images_and_fusion_of_the_algorithms","225190710_Fast_3D_Brain_Segmentation_Using_Dual-Front_Active_Contours_with_Optional_User-Interaction","225133542_Quick_Shift_and_Kernel_Methods_for_Mode_Seeking","221364208_Spectral_Segmentation_with_Multiscale_Graph_Decomposition","221305166_Superpixels_and_Supervoxels_in_an_Energy_Optimization_Framework","220659550_A_Metric_Approach_to_Vector-Valued_Image_Segmentation","220599968_Knowledge-based_organ_identification_from_CT_images","41188524_Radioembolization_of_Liver_Tumors_With_Yttrium-90_Microspheres","24002433_Comparison_and_Evaluation_of_Methods_for_Liver_Segmentation_From_CT_Datasets","12593967_Safety_of_donors_in_live_donor_liver_transplantation_using_right_lobe_grafts","6927967_Automated_Hepatic_Volumetry_for_Living_Related_Liver_Transplantation_At_Multisection_CT1","3193392_Meer_P_Mean_shift_A_Robust_Approach_Toward_Feature_Space_Analysis_IEEE_Transactions_on_Pattern_Analysis_and_Machine_Intelligence_245_603-619","2477494_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","2414060_Level_set_methods_and_fast_marching_methods_Evolving_interfaces_in_computational_geometry_fluid_mechanics_computer_vision_and_materials_science"]}
