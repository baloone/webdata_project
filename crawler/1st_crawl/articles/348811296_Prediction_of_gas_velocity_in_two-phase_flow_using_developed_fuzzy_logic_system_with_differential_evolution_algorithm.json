{"id":"348811296_Prediction_of_gas_velocity_in_two-phase_flow_using_developed_fuzzy_logic_system_with_differential_evolution_algorithm","abstract":"In this investigation, differential evolution (DE) algorithm with the fuzzy inference system (FIS) are combined and the DE algorithm is employed in FIS training process. Considered data in this study were extracted from simulation of a 2D two-phase reactor in which gas was sparged from bottom of reactor, and the injected gas velocities were between 0.05 to 0.11 m/s. After doing a couple of training by making some changes in DE parameters and FIS parameters, the greatest percentage of FIS capacity was achieved. By applying the optimized model, the gas phase velocity in x direction inside the reactor was predicted when the injected gas velocity was 0.08 m/s.","authors":["Meisam Babanezhad","Samyar Zabihi","Iman Behroyan","Ali Taghvaie Nakhjiri"],"meta":["January 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):2380","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-81957-3"],"references":["353433736_Optimization_of_Intelligent_Controllers_Using_a_Type-1_and_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Harmony_Search_Algorithm","347138957_Liquid_temperature_prediction_in_bubbly_flow_using_ant_colony_optimization_algorithm_in_the_fuzzy_inference_system_as_a_trainer","343496399_Developing_Intelligent_Algorithm_as_a_Machine_Learning_Overview_over_the_Big_Data_Generated_by_Euler-Euler_Method_To_Simulate_Bubble_Column_Reactor_Hydrodynamics","339278677_Prediction_of_Nanofluid_Temperature_Inside_the_Cavity_by_Integration_of_Grid_Partition_Clustering_Categorization_of_a_Learning_Structure_with_the_Fuzzy_System","338995471_Prediction_of_flow_characteristics_in_the_bubble_column_reactor_by_the_artificial_pheromone-based_communication_of_biological_ants","338105459_Prediction_of_fluid_pattern_in_a_shear_flow_on_intelligent_neural_nodes_using_ANFIS_and_LBM","342399695_Changes_in_the_Number_of_Membership_Functions_for_Predicting_the_Gas_Volume_Fraction_in_Two-Phase_Flow_Using_Grid_Partition_Clustering_of_the_ANFIS_Method","337276956_Simulation_of_a_Bubble-Column_Reactor_by_Three-Dimensional_CFD_Multidimension-_and_Function-Adaptive_Network-Based_Fuzzy_Inference_System","337120553_Flow_visualization_and_analysis_of_thermal_distribution_for_the_nanofluid_by_the_integration_of_fuzzy_c-means_clustering_ANFIS_structure_and_CFD_methods","335083093_A_high-speed_interval_type_2_fuzzy_system_approach_for_dynamic_parameter_adaptation_in_metaheuristics"]}
