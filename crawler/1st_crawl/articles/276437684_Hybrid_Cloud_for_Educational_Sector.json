{"id":"276437684_Hybrid_Cloud_for_Educational_Sector","abstract":"Cloud is an emergent field that relates virtual memory and storage to real time application. The organization and architecture of cloud varies on the basis of its set up and uses. It has profound applications in the field ranging from education sector to social networking and extended to international relations and business. To evolve and instrument a cloud architecture by modifying the platforms and implementing the concept of hybrid cloud along with cloud building techniques, using Big Data Analytics to formulate the statistical organization of the cloud service. In this paper we propose the hybrid cloud interface where the user from different educational sectors interact with the cloud environment and request the cloud provider to showcase the resources.","authors":["Aishwarya Srinivasan","Abdul Quadir Md","Vijayakumar Varadarajan"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia Computer Science 50:37-41","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2015.04.008","Project: Cloud, BigData, IOT, Cognitive Science, Ontology"],"references":["270383462_Cloud_Standardization_Consistent_Business_Processes_and_Information","220498902_The_RESERVOIR_Model_and_architecture_for_open_federated_cloud_computing","302452677_Risks_in_Enterprise_Cloud_Computing_The_Perspective_of_it_Experts","274072825_Cloud_Computing_Overview_and_Risk_Analysis","272854948_Public_vs_Private_vs_Hybrid_vs_Community_-_Cloud_Computing_A_Critical_Review","262155206_Trust_Management_of_Services_in_Cloud_Environments_Obstacles_and_Solutions","244525604_Virtual_Workspaces_Achieving_Quality_of_Service_and_Quality_of_Life_in_the_Grid","221475430_The_Performance_Impact_of_Advance_Reservation_Meta-scheduling","221150890_Cloud_Computing_for_On-Demand_Grid_Resource_Provisioning","221148554_Resource_Leasing_and_the_Art_of_Suspending_Virtual_Machines"]}
