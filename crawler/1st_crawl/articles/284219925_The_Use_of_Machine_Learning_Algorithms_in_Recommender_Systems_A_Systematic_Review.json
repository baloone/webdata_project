{"id":"284219925_The_Use_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_in_Recommender_Systems_A_Systematic_Review","abstract":"Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users product recommendations.\nRecently, these systems started using machine learning algorithms because of\nthe progress and popularity of the artificial intelligence research field.\nHowever, choosing the suitable machine learning algorithm is difficult because\nof the sheer number of algorithms available in the literature. Researchers and\npractitioners are left with little information about the best approaches or the\ntrends in algorithms usage. Moreover, the development of a recommender system\nfeaturing a machine learning algorithm has problems and open questions that\nmust be evaluated, so software engineers know where to focus research efforts.\nThis work presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use\nof machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies research\nopportunities for the software engineering research field. The study concluded\nthat Bayesian and decision tree algorithms are widely used in recommender\nsystems because of their low complexity, and that requirements and design\nphases of recommender system development must be investigated for research\nopportunities.","authors":["Ivens Portugal","Paulo Alencar","Donald D Cowan"],"meta":["November 2015Expert Systems with Applications 97","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2017.12.020","SourcearXiv"],"references":["314721769_An_adaptive_stock_tracker_for_personalized_trading_advice","312775005_MapReduce_Simplified_data_processing_on_large_clusters","305397619_Data_Clustering_A_Review","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","297300191_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Problem_Solving_in_Computational_Applications_Intelligent_Techniques","292379290_A_Text_Clustering_Approach_of_Chinese_News_Based_on_Neural_Network_Language_Model","289977680_Group_Recommender_Systems_Some_experimental_results","288854917_Improving_Scalability_of_Personalized_Recommendation_Systems_for_Enterprise_Knowledge_Workers","282299082_Building_a_Distributed_Generic_Recommender_Using_Scalable_Data_Mining_Library","276857332_Global_Optimization_for_Advertisement_Selection_in_Sponsored_Search"]}
