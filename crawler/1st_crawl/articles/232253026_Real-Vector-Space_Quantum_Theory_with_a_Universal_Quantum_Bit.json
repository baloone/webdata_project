{"id":"232253026_Real-Vector-Space_Quantum_Theory_with_a_Universal_Quantum_Bit","abstract":"We explore a model of the world based on real-vector-space quantum theory. In\nour model the familiar complex phase appearing in quantum states is replaced by\na single binary object that we call the ubit, which is not localized and which\ncan interact with any object in the world. Ordinary complex-vector-space\nquantum theory can be recovered from this model if we simply impose a certain\nrestriction on the sets of allowed measurements and transformations\n(Stueckelberg's rule), but in this paper we try to obtain the standard theory,\nor a close approximation to it, without invoking such a restriction. We look\nparticularly at the effective theory that applies to a subsystem when the ubit\nis interacting with a much larger environment. In a certain limit it turns out\nthat the ubit-environment interaction has the effect of enforcing\nStueckelberg's rule automatically, and we obtain a one-parameter family of\neffective theories--modifications of standard quantum theory--that all satisfy\nthis rule. The one parameter is the ratio s/omega, where s quantifies the\nstrength of the ubit's interaction with the rest of the world and omega is the\nubit's rotation rate. We find that when this parameter is small but not zero,\nthe effective theory is similar to standard quantum theory but is characterized\nby spontaneous decoherence of isolated systems.","authors":["Antoniya Aleksandrova","Victoria Borish","William K.
