{"id":"269292498_Networked_Control_Systems_A_time-delay_approach","abstract":"Networked control systems (NCSs) are spatially distributed systems for which the communication between sensors, actuators, and controllers is supported by a shared communication network. This paper gives an overview of the time-delay approach to NCSs. Firstly, the modelling on the Networked Control Systems (NCSs) with one sensor node is recalled. Then, for the NCSs with distributed sensor nodes and Round-Robin (RR) protocol, the closed-loop system can be presented as a switched system with multiple ordered delays. Next, a continuous-time hybrid system model for the closed-loop system, where time-varying delays appear in the dynamics and in the reset equations, is introduced to NCSs under RR and Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocols. Lastly, the hybrid system modelling for the closed-loop system is extended to the discrete-time case. Differently from other approaches to NCSs in the presence of scheduling protocols (in the frameworks of hybrid and discrete-time systems), the time-delay approach allows the communication delays to be greater than the sampling intervals.","authors":["Kun Liu","Emilia Fridman","Laurentiu Hetel"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/ECC.2014.6862633","Conference: 2014 European Control Conference (ECC)"],"references":["245857740_Delay-dependent_stability_and_H_control_Constant_and_time-varying_delays","229433072_Stability_of_Delay_Impulsive_Systems_with_Application_to_Networked_Control_Systems","224397370_A_Unified_Framework_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Networked_and_Quantized_Control_Systems","224214238_Stability_Analysis_of_Networked_Control_Systems_Using_a_Switched_Linear_Systems_Approach","220158398_Brief_paper_A_refined_input_delay_approach_to_sampled-data_control","2998163_Special_Issue_on_Technology_of_Networked_Control_Systems","326613602_Stability_analysis_of_systems_with_aperiodic_sample-and-hold_devices","288161953_Networked_control_with_a_stochastic_scheduling_A_time-delay_approach","285852373_Switching_in_systems_and_control_Birkhauser","284967741_A_refined_input_delay_approach_to_sampled-data_control","261567792_Discrete-time_network-based_control_under_scheduling_and_actuator_constraints","261499927_Network-based_control_via_a_novel_analysis_of_hybrid_systems_with_time-varying_delays","257012403_Stability_and_L2L2-gain_analysis_of_Networked_Control_Systems_under_Round-Robin_scheduling_A_time-delay_approach","241045043_Stability_of_Time-Delay_Systems","227727574_Networked-based_stabilization_via_discontinuous_Lyapunov_functionals","225075511_Stability_of_Time-Delay_System","224112751_Networked_Control_Systems_With_Communication_Constraints_Tradeoffs_Between_Transmission_Intervals_Delays_and_Performance","223189780_Delay-range-dependent_stability_for_Systems_with_Time-Varying_Delay","223155844_Stability_analysis_of_systems_with_aperiodic_sample-and-hold_device","222433147_Robust_sampled-data_stabilization_of_linear_systems_-_An_input_delay_approach","222433033_Exponential_stability_of_impulsive_systems_with_application_to_uncertain_sampled-data_systems","221658449_Switching_in_System_and_Control","220156820_Wirtinger's_inequality_and_Lyapunov-based_sampled-data_stabilization","220156240_Reciprocally_convex_approach_to_stability_of_systems_with_time-varying_delays","3033073_Network-Based_Output_Tracking_Control"]}
