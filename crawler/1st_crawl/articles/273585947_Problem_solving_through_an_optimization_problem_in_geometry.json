{"id":"273585947_Problem_solving_through_an_optimization_problem_in_geometry","abstract":"This article adapts the problem-solving model developed by PÃ³lya to investigate and give an innovative approach to discuss\nand solve an optimization problem in geometry: the Regiomontanus Problem and its application to football. Various mathematical\ntools, such as calculus, inequality and the properties of circles, are used to explore and reflect on the different aspects\nof the problem and its solution. In addition, other than the traditional calculus approach to solve this problem, an elegant\ngeometric approach is introduced.","authors":["Kin Keung Poon","H.-C.
