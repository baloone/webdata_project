{"id":"318237628_Constructive_Canonicity_for_Lattice-Based_Fixed_Point_Logics","abstract":"In the present paper, we prove canonicity results for lattice-based fixed point logics in a constructive meta-theory. Specifically, we prove two types of canonicity results, depending on how the fixed-point binders are interpreted. These results smoothly unify the constructive canonicity results for inductive inequalities, proved in a general lattice setting, with the canonicity results for fixed point logics on a bi-intuitionistic base, proven in a non-constructive setting.","authors":["Willem Conradie","Andrew Craig","Alessandra Palmigiano","Zhiguang Zhao"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-55386-2_7","Conference: International Workshop on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation","Project: unified correspondence"],"references":["318709011_Toward_an_Epistemic-Logical_Theory_of_Categorization","305988713_Unified_Correspondence_as_a_Proof-Theoretic_Tool","305908493_Categories_How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_Two_Sorts","301837337_Constructive_Canonicity_of_Inductive_Inequalities","281424186_Jonsson-style_canonicity_for_ALBA-inequalities","265127941_Canonicity_results_for_mu-calculi_An_algorithmic_approach","264623835_Dual_characterizations_for_finite_lattices_via_correspondence_theory_for_monotone_modal_logic","222516983_Bounded_Lattice_Expansions","38338924_Canonical_extensions_and_relational_completeness_of_some_substructural_logics","332384587_Algorithmic_correspondence_and_canonicity_for_non-distributive_logics","301846946_Sahlqvist_theory_for_impossible_worlds","301818312_Unified_Correspondence_and_Proof_Theory_for_Strict_Implication","300169419_Unified_Correspondence","283986715_Canonicity_and_Relativized_Canonicity_via_Pseudo-Correspondence_an_Application_of_ALBA","283889157_On_Sahlqvist_theory_for_hybrid_logics","283186541_Epistemic_logics_for_sceptical_agents","269728144_Algorithmic_correspondence_for_intuitionistic_modal_mu-calculus","265423403_Algebraic_modal_correspondence_Sahlqvist_and_beyond","257144679_Sahlqvist_theorem_for_modal_fixed_point_logic","232716920_Results_on_the_Propositional_mu-Calculus","222490611_Duality_and_the_completeness_of_the_modal_m-calculus","220394663_Algorithmic_correspondence_and_canonicity_for_distributive_modal_logic","220394016_Constructive_Canonicity_in_Non-Classical_Logics","220315423_A_New_Proof_of_Sahlqvist's_Theorem_on_Modal_Definability_and_Completeness","220297593_On_the_canonicity_of_Sahlqvist_identities","45879028_Least_and_Greatest_Fixed_Points_in_Linear_Logic","35631516_Completeness_and_Correspondence_in_the_First_and_Second_Order_Semantics_for_Modal_Logic"]}
