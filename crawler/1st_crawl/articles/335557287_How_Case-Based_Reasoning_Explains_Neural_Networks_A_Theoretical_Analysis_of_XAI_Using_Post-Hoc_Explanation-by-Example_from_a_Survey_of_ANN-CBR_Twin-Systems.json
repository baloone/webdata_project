{"id":"335557287_How_Case-Based_Reasoning_Explains_Neural_Networks_A_Theoretical_Analysis_of_XAI_Using_Post-Hoc_Explanation-by-Example_from_a_Survey_of_ANN-CBR_Twin-Systems","abstract":"This paper proposes a theoretical analysis of one approach to the eXplainable AI (XAI) problem, using post-hoc explanation-by-example, that relies on the twinning of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with case-based reasoning (CBR) systems; so-called ANN-CBR twins. It surveys these systems to advance a new theoretical interpretation of previous work and define a road map for CBRâ€™s further role in XAI. A systematic survey of 1,102 papers was conducted to identify a fragmented literature on this topic and trace its influence to more recent work involving deep neural networks (DNNs). The twin-systems approach is advanced as one possible coherent, generic solution to the XAI problem. The paper concludes by road-mapping future directions for this XAI solution, considering (i) further tests of feature-weighting techniques, (ii) how explanatory cases might be deployed (e.g., in counterfactuals, a fortori cases), and (iii) the unwelcome, much-ignored issue of user evaluation.","authors":["Mark T.
