{"id":"294873311_Overview_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_Opacity_models_validation_and_quantification","abstract":"Over the last decade, opacity of discrete event systems (DES) has become a very fertile field of research. Driven by safety and privacy concerns in network communications and online services, much theoretical work has been conducted in order to design opaque systems. A system is opaque if an external observer in unable to infer a \"secret\" about the system behavior. This paper aims to review the most commonly used techniques of opacity validation for deterministic models and opacity quantification for probabilistic ones. Available complexity results are also provided. Finally, we review existing tools for opacity validation and current applications.","authors":["Romain Jacob","Jean-Jacques Lesage","Jean-Marc Faure"],"meta":["June 2016Annual Reviews in Control 41","DOI:10.1016/j.arcontrol.2016.04.015"],"references":["289196032_Adaptation_Computing_Parameters_of_Pan-Tilt-Zoom_Cameras_for_Traffic_Monitoring","282960476_Opacity_formulations_and_verification_in_discrete_event_systems","325910490_Monitoring_confidentiality_by_diagnosis_techniques","312998514_Enforceable_security_policies","309606589_Non-interference_in_Partial_Order_Models","304191839_Opaque_Superlanguages_and_Sublanguages_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","301405310_Automatic_design_of_discreet_discrete_filters","295404854_Verification_and_Enforcement_of_Opacity_Security_Properties_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","286561817_An_On-the-Fly_Approach_for_the_Verification_of_Opacity_in_Critical_Systems","283936684_Towards_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Opacity"]}
