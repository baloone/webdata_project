{"id":"326749097_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms_on_Social_Networks_ICCI-2017","abstract":"Social networks display community structures of interest, which have to be uncovered to understand the latent relationships present in them. These networks are composed of loosely connected small clusters, whose structure is more convenient for analysis. Graph clustering algorithms have been developed to identify communities in real or artificial networks using structural characteristics of the network. Determining the efficiency of such techniques with respect to accuracy and computational time is an open question in the absence of ground truth labels for the underlying communities as is seen in most real-world situations. In this study, performance of eight state-of-the-art graph clustering algorithms are demonstrated on small egocentric graphs, obtained from Facebook. The results are used for objective evaluation and a critical discussion is presented.","authors":["Pranav Nerurkar","Madhav Chandane","Sunil Bhirud"],"meta":["January 2019Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","DOI:10.1007/978-981-13-1132-1_23","In book: Computational Intelligence: Theories, Applications and Future Directions - Volume I (pp.287-298)"],"references":["315591374_Community_detection_in_social_networks","318904522_Community_detection_in_social_networks","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","305780197_Community_detection_in_networks_A_user_guide","301870398_Computing_communities_in_large_networks_using_random_walks_long_version","265327323_Experimental_Algorithms_-_11th_International_Symposium_SEA_2012_Bordeaux_France_June_7-9_2012_Proceedings","253253918_Detecting_Community_Structure_in_Networks","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks","220639605_Computing_Communities_in_Large_Networks_Using_Random_Walks","23464007_Benchmark_graphs_for_testing_community_detection_algorithms"]}
