It quantitatively evaluates the performance of three optimisation algorithms namely: Dijkstra, Aâˆ—, and Genetic algorithms that are used to find multi-criteria paths in construction sites based on transportation and safety-related cost. During a construction project, site planners need to select paths for site operatives and vehicles, which are characterised by short distance, low risks and high visibility. These path evaluation criteria are combined using a multi-objective approach. The criteria can be optimised to present site planners with the shortest path, the safest path, the most visible path or a path that reflects a combination of short distance, low risk and high visibility. The accuracy of the path solutions and the time complexities of the optimisation algorithms are compared and critically analysed.","authors":["A.R. Soltani","H. Tawfik","J.Y. Goulermas","T.
