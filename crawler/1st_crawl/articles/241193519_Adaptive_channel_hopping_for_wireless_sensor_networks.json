{"id":"241193519_Adaptive_channel_hopping_for_wireless_sensor_networks","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are an essential element of the Internet of Things. However, their performance is influenced by many factors such as interference from other co-located wireless communication technologies that are sharing the same spectrum and fading due to environmental factors. Channel hopping is one of several adaptation techniques introduced to mitigate these adverse effects. This paper investigates adaptive channel hopping and the advantages and costs related to augmenting existing WSN systems with this capability. We provide complete design and implementation details on OpenWSN considering specifically the case of IEEE 802.15.4e, and also present the results of our experiments. The main finding of this work is that blacklisting can provide a significant improvement in the performance of channel hopping protocols and thus enhance the overall reliability of WSNs in the presence of interference and fading.","authors":["Peng Du","George Roussos"],"meta":["October 2011","DOI:10.1109/iCOST.2011.6085828"],"references":["228555393_TSMP_Time_synchronized_mesh_protocol","224677468_Radio_Channel_Quality_in_Industrial_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224564885_Investigating_WirelessHART_coexistence_issues_through_a_specifically_designed_simulator","224298045_A_Kalman_Filter_Based_Link_Quality_Estimation_Scheme_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222412073_CRAHNs_Cognitive_radio_ad_hoc_networks","221284066_Foresee_4C_Wireless_link_prediction_using_link_features","221251794_Reliability_Through_Frequency_Diversity_Why_Channel_Hopping_Makes_Sense","221138007_Frequency_Agility_in_IPv6-Based_Wireless_Personal_Area_Networks_6LoWPAN","220099233_Performance_Improvement_of_Wireless_Communications_Using_Frequency_Hopping_Spread_Spectrum","284776723_Cognitive_radio_Brain-empowered_wireless_communications_selected_areas_in_communications","242382586_Distributed_cognitive_coexistence_of_802154_with_80211","241618308_Interference_Avoidance_in_Wireless_Multihop_Networks","238576299_RSSI_is_under_appreciated","234785537_Feasibility_Analysis_of_Controller_Design_for_Adaptive_Channel_Hopping","224608051_Impact_of_Wi-Fi_traffic_on_the_IEEE_802154_channels_occupation_in_indoor_environments","224392604_A_Survey_of_Spectrum_Sensing_Algorithms_for_Cognitive_Radio_Applications","222533223_NeXt_GenerationDynamic_Spectrum_AccessCognitive_Radio_Wireless_Networks_A_Survey","221172170_DH-MAC_a_dynamic_channel_hopping_MAC_protocol_for_cognitive_radio_networks","220255712_Wireless_sensor_networks_Enabling_technology_for_ambient_intelligence","37598366_High-throughput_routing_for_multi-hop_wireless_networks","4070756_Bluetooth_adaptive_frequency_hopping_and_scheduling","3344066_Maguire_GQ_Cognitive_radio_making_software_radios_more_personal_IEEE_Pers_Commun_64_13-18","3236042_Haykin_S_Cognitive_radio_Brain-empowered_wireless_communications_IEEE_JSAC_232_201-220"]}
