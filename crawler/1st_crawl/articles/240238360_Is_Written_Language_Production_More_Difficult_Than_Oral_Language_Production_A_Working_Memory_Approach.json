{"id":"240238360_Is_Written_Language_Production_More_Difficult_Than_Oral_Language_Production_A_Working_Memory_Approach","abstract":"Is written language production more difficult than oral language production? Probably, yes. But why?Several experiments were conducted in order to test the impact of low-level activities involved in writing on the performance of higher-level activities also involved in writing. Three assumptions were made: (1) the capacity of working-memory is limited, (2) every component of writing has a cognitive load, and (3) every increase in the load devoted to the activity of one component would lead to a decrease in the remaining resources available for the other components. These low-level activities are more resource-consuming in children than in adults because children have not yet automated these activities. So, it was hypothezised that the difficulties encountered by children in dealing with the low-level activities would have a negative impact on the performance of higher activities.To test that hypothesis, a serial recall paradigm was used. Adults and children were asked to recall series of words, either orally or in writing. The results showed that: (1) serial recall of children, but not of adults, was weaker with writing as compared to speaking; (2) the slowness of writing relative to speaking did not explain these results; and (3) the difficulties of graphic and of orthographic transcription were partially responsible for these results.These results are discussed in the general framework of production models.","authors":["Bourdin BÃ©atrice","Fayol Michel"],"meta":["October 1994International Journal of Psychology 29(5):591-620","DOI:10.1080/00207599408248175"],"references":["247917347_L'utilisation_de_quelques_connecteurs_dans_des_rappels_de_recits_chez_des_enfants_de_5_a_8_ans","284641559_COORDINATING_LANGUAGE_GENERATION_AND_MOTOR_CONTROL_IN_DISCOURSE_PRODUCTION_VIA_HANDWRITING","274810024_Speaking_From_Intention_to_Articulation","265414164_Reading_Writing_and_Dyslexia","247518853_Vocalization-at-presentation_and_Immediate_Recall_with_Varying_Recall_Methods","246255402_From_sentence_production_to_text_production_Investigating_fundamental_processes","243778887_Acoustic_confusion_in_immediate_memory","243763687_The_organization_of_processing_structure_for_language_production_Applications_to_aphasic_speech","242457304_The_pregnant_pause_An_inquiry_into_the_nature_of_planning","234751264_Writing_Performance","232582466_Restructuring_Versus_Automaticity_Alternative_Accounts_of_Skill_Acquisition","232568886_Controlled_and_automatic_human_information_processing_II_Perceptual_learning_automatic_attending_and_a_general_theory","232602687_Serial_recall_and_the_modality_effect_Effects_of_word_frequency","232594724_Cognitive_capacity_differences_among_writers","232592267_On_the_disruption_of_short-term_memory_by_a_response_prefix"]}
