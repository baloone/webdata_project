{"id":"308050198_Identifying_Smart_Design_Attributes_for_Industry_40_Customization_Using_a_Clustering_Genetic_Algorithm","abstract":"Industry 4.0 aims at achieving mass customization at a mass production cost. A key component to realizing this is accurate prediction of customer needs and wants, which is however a challenging issue due to the lack of smart analytics tools. This paper investigates this issue in depth and then develops a predictive analytic framework for integrating cloud computing, big data analysis, business informatics, communication technologies, and digital industrial production systems. Computational intelligence in the form of a cluster k-means approach is used to manage relevant big data for feeding potential customer needs and wants to smart designs for targeted productivity and customized mass production. The identification of patterns from big data is achieved with cluster k-means and with the selection of optimal attributes using genetic algorithms. A car customization case study shows how it may be applied and where to assign new clusters with growing knowledge of customer needs and wants. This approach offer a number of features suitable to smart design in realizing Industry 4.0.","authors":["Alfredo ALAN Flores-Saldivar","Cindy Goh","Yun Li","Leo Chen"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1109/IConAC.2016.7604954","Conference: The 22nd IEEE International Conference on Automation & ComputingAt: University of Essex, Colchester, UK","Project: Customisation for Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing"],"references":["307864150_Design_Principles_for_Industrie_40_Scenarios_A_Literature_Review","302546244_Predictive_Customer_Analytics_and_Real-Time_Business_Intelligence","295243586_Opportunities_of_Sustainable_Manufacturing_in_Industry_40","274894802_Industry_40_-Potentials_for_Creating_Smart_Products_Empirical_Research_Results","271528854_Industrial_Internet_Pushing_the_Boundaries_of_Minds_and_Machines","271524319_Industrial_Internet_Pushing_the_boundaries_of_minds_and_machines","267488952_MTConnect-Based_Kaizen_for_Machine_Tool_Processes","263507628_Service_Innovation_and_Smart_Analytics_for_Industry_40_and_Big_Data_Environment","227311482_CAutoCSD-evolutionary_search_and_optimisation_enabled_computer_automated_control_system_design","4245759_Real_Time_Business_Intelligence_for_the_Adaptive_Enterprise","319181822_Industrie_40_-_Manufacturing_Work_of_the_Future","309052460_3D_Opportunity_Additive_manufacturing_paths_to_performance_innovation_and_growth","301322018_Digital_ManufacturingIndustry_40","299825086_Intelligent_Manufacturing_Technologies","284761944_Change_Through_Digitization-Value_Creation_in_the_Age_of_Industry_40","283649383_Mass_customization_Opportunities_methods_and_challenges_for_manufacturers","272825857_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository","223994094_The_Real_Leadership_Lessons_of_Steve_Jobs"]}
