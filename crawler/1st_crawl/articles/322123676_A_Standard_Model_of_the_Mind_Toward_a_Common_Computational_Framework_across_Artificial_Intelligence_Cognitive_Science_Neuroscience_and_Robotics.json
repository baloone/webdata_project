{"id":"322123676_A_Standard_Model_of_the_Mind_Toward_a_Common_Computational_Framework_across_Artificial_Intelligence_Cognitive_Science_Neuroscience_and_Robotics","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to begin the process of engaging the international research community in developing what can be called a standard model of the mind, where the mind we have in mind here is human-like. The notion of a standard model has its roots in physics, where over more than a half-century the international community has developed and tested a standard model that combines much of what is known about particles. This model is assumed to be internally consistent, yet still have major gaps. Its function is to serve as a cumulative reference point for the field while also driving efforts to both extend and break it.","authors":["John E.
