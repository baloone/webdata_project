{"id":"342156939_Equilibria_for_games_with_combined_qualitative_and_quantitative_objectives","abstract":"The overall aim of our research is to develop techniques to reason about the equilibrium properties of multi-agent systems. We model multi-agent systems as concurrent games, in which each player is a process that is assumed to act independently and strategically in pursuit of personal preferences. In this article, we study these games in the context of finite-memory strategies, and we assume players’ preferences are defined by a qualitative and a quantitative objective, which are related by a lexicographic order: a player first prefers to satisfy its qualitative objective (given as a formula of linear temporal logic) and then prefers to minimise costs (given by a mean-payoff function). Our main result is that deciding the existence of a strict \\(\\epsilon \\) Nash equilibrium in such games is 2ExpTime-complete (and hence decidable), even if players’ deviations are implemented as infinite-memory strategies.","authors":["Julian Gutierrez","Aniello Murano","Giuseppe Perelli","Sasha Rubin"],"meta":["December 2021Acta Informatica 58(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00236-020-00385-4"],"references":["317318149_Nash_Equilibria_in_Concurrent_Games_with_Lexicographic_Preferences","304341728_Synthesis_with_rational_environments","275588466_Technical_Report_Model-Checking_for_Resource-Bounded_ATL_with_Production_and_Consumption_of_Resources","350579473_The_complexity_of_decision_problems_about_equilibria_in_two-player_Boolean_games","326205477_Synthesis_of_Controllable_Nash_Equilibria_in_Quantitative_Objective_Game","316235651_Incentive_engineering_for_Boolean_games","316080793_From_model_checking_to_equilibrium_checking_Reactive_modules_for_rational_verification","303969276_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","284596275_Handbook_of_theoretical_computer_science_volume_b_Formal_models_and_semantics_Bchapter","274094010_Pure_Nash_Equilibria_in_Concurrent_Deterministic_Games","260232150_Secure_Equilibria_in_Weighted_Games","238759536_Modular_synthesis_of_reactive_systems","266709973_Multiagent_Systems_Algorithmic_Game-Theoretic_and_Logical_Foundations","262350240_Iterated_Boolean_games","256660338_On_the_complexity_of_planning_for_agent_teams_and_its_implications_for_single_agent_planning"]}
