{"id":"338736865_Strict_Minimal_Siphon-Based_Colored_Petri_Net_Supervisor_Synthesis_for_Automated_Manufacturing_Systems_With_Unreliable_Resources","abstract":"Various deadlock control policies for automated manufacturing systems with reliable and shared resources have been developed, based on Petri nets. In practical applications, a resource may be unreliable. Thus, the deadlock control policies proposed in previous studies are not applicable to such applications. This paper proposes a two-step robust deadlock control strategy for systems with unreliable and shared resources. In the first step, a live (deadlock-free) controlled system that does not consider the failure of resources is derived by using strict minimal siphon control. The second step deals with deadlock control issues caused by the failures of the resources. Considering all resource failures, a common recovery subnet based on colored Petri nets is proposed for all resource failures in the Petri net model. The recovery subnet is added to the derived system at the first step to make the system reliable. The proposed method has been tested using an automated manufacturing system deployed at King Saud University.","authors":["Abdulrahman Al-Ahmari","Husam Kaid","Zhiwu Li","Reggie Davidrajuh"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE Access 8:1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968469"],"references":["338121863_Single_Controller-Based_Colored_Petri_Nets_for_Deadlock_Control_in_Automated_Manufacturing_Systems","337985934_K-Codiagnosability_Verification_of_Labeled_Petri_Nets","335671435_An_MIP-based_Deadlock_Prevention_Policy_for_Siphon_Control","335603448_Global_Supervisory_Structure_for_Decentralized_Systems_of_Flexible_Manufacturing_Systems_Using_Petri_Nets","335357780_On_Algebraic_Identification_of_Critical_States_for_Deadlock_Control_in_Automated_Manufacturing_Systems_Modeled_With_Petri_Nets","333684042_Design_and_implementation_of_deadlock_control_for_automated_manufacturing_systems","330890072_Elementary_Siphon-Based_Robust_Control_for_Automated_Manufacturing_Systems_With_Multiple_Unreliable_Resources","333630309_A_Siphon-based_Deadlock_Prevention_Strategy_for_S3PR","332662558_A_Deadlock_Prevention_Policy_for_Flexible_Manufacturing_Systems_Modeled_With_Petri_Nets_Using_Structural_Analysis","324710476_Robust_Deadlock_Control_for_Automated_Manufacturing_Systems_With_Unreliable_Resources_Based_on_Petri_Net_Reachability_Graphs"]}
