{"id":"313332100_Constrained_Brownian_processes_and_constrained_Brownian_bridges","abstract":"We present a novel approach to describe Brownian paths that end at a given final point at a fixed time, and having the additional constrain of a fixed area under its curve. Both anticipative (in this case, knowledge of the future of the path is required) and non-anticipative solutions are exposed. In particular, for the non-anticipative representation a local stochastic differential equation is derived which leads to an effective Langevin equation. This representation allows us to generate statistically independent realizations of the constrained process in a very efficient way.","authors":["Alain Mazzolo"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Statistical Mechanics Theory and Experiment 2017(2):023203","DOI:10.1088/1742-5468/aa4f15"],"references":["281488545_The_critical_catastrophe_revisited","281115748_Inequivalence_of_nonequilibrium_path_ensembles_The_example_of_stochastic_bridges","226480998_Gaussian_Bridges","226045848_Beyond_Hazard_Rates_A_New_Framework_for_Credit-Risk_Modelling","224959301_Generalized_Gaussian_Bridges","7291292_Spatial_survival_probability_for_one-dimensional_fluctuating_interfaces_in_the_steady_state","321520514_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","273388307_Effective_Langevin_equations_for_constrained_stochastic_processes","268761060_Conditional_Brownian_motion_and_the_boundary_limits_of_harmonic_functions","262489241_Nonequilibrium_Markov_Processes_Conditioned_on_Large_Deviations","235622487_Stochastic_Calculus_Models_for_Finance_II_Continuous_Time_Models","227423316_Conditioned_stochastic_differential_equations_Theory_examples_and_application_to_finance","51104140_Generating_Transition_Paths_by_Langevin_Bridges","44476730_Classical_Potential_Theory_and_Its_Probabilistic_Counterpart","23635745_A_Karhunen-Loeve_expansion_for_a_mean-centered_Brownian_bridge","5927446_Analyzing_Animal_Movements_Using_Brownian_Bridges","1874340_Airy_Distribution_Function_From_the_Area_Under_a_Brownian_Excursion_to_the_Maximal_Height_of_Fluctuating_Interfaces"]}
