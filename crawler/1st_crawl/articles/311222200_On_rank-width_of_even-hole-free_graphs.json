{"id":"311222200_On_rank-width_of_even-hole-free_graphs","abstract":"We present a class of (diamond, even hole)-free graphs with no clique cutset that has unbounded rank-width. In general, even-hole-free graphs have unbounded rank-width, because chordal graphs are even-hole-free. A.A. da Silva, A. Silva and C. Linhares-Sales (2010) showed that planar even-hole-free graphs have bounded rank-width, and N.K. Le (2016) showed that even-hole-free graphs with no star cutset have bounded rank-width. A natural question is to ask, whether even-hole-free graphs with no clique cutsets have bounded rank-width. Our result gives a negative answer. Hence we cannot apply Courcelle and Makowsky's meta-theorem which would provide efficient algorithms for a large number of problems, including the maximum independent set problem, whose complexity remains open for (diamond, even hole)-free graphs.","authors":["Isolde Adler","Khang Ngoc Le","Haiko Müller","Marko Radovanović"],"meta":["November 2016"],"references":["310953418_Structure_and_algorithms_for_cap_even_hole-free_graphs","303571221_Decomposition_of_even-hole-free_graphs_with_star_cutsets_and_2-joins","241278983_Stable_Sets_and_Graphs_with_no_Even_Holes","226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","223067838_Handle-rewriting_hypergraph_grammars","303571208_Vertex_elimination_orderings_for_hereditary_graph_classes","265699743_The_world_of_hereditary_graph_classes_viewed_through_Truemper_configurations","258247106_A_Faster_Algorithm_to_Recognize_Even-Hole-Free_Graphs","238800896_b-Perfect_Graphs","227529893_Even-hole-free_graphs_Part_II_Recognition_algorithm"]}
