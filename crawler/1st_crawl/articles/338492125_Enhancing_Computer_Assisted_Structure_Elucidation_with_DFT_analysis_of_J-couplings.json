{"id":"338492125_Enhancing_Computer_Assisted_Structure_Elucidation_with_DFT_analysis_of_J-couplings","abstract":"Computer‐Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) is the class of expert systems that derives molecular structures primarily from 1D and 2D NMR data. Contemporary CASE systems, including ACD/Structure Elucidator (ACD/SE), consider cross‐peaks in HMBC and COSY spectra as 2 or 3‐bond correlations by default. However, 4 and more bond correlations (nonstandard correlations, NSC) could be present in these spectra too. The indiscriminate addition of NSCs to the CASE computations is prohibitively expensive. To address this problem, the ACD/SE program performs a logical analysis of observed correlations and determines the minimum number of NSCs. Guided by this information, a more efficient Fuzzy Structure Generation (FSG) algorithm is subsequently applied. Until now, the FSG algorithm was utilized without any verification of the reliability of found NSCs. Here we report a verification method for NSCs based on the relationship between NSCs and J‐couplings computed with high accuracy DFT methods. We used the example of strychnine to show that 41 (32%) of 8 Hz HMBC cross‐peaks were NSCs and were consistent with 4‐6JCH couplings greater than 0.3 Hz. This cutoff value was largely confirmed by the analysis of NSCs in eleven real‐world natural products elucidated by ACD/SE. Additionally, utilizing the example of the CASE study of cleospinol A, we showed that the DFT computed J‐couplings of NSCs can distinctively differentiate the correct structure among six proposed isomers. The proposed approach of NSC verification should further improve the robustness of CASE analysis and can help reveal potential problems with reported experimental data.","authors":["Alexei V Buevich","Mikhail Elyashberg"],"meta":["January 2020Magnetic Resonance in Chemistry 58(9)","DOI:10.1002/mrc.4996"],"references":["333120800_Computationally-assisted_discovery_and_structure_elucidation_of_natural_products","329413283_Crystal_Structures_and_Cytotoxicity_of_ent-Kaurane-Type_Diterpenoids_from_Two_Aspilia_Species","326380458_Computational_Methodologies_in_the_Exploration_of_Marine_Natural_Product_Leads","325803587_Why_is_HMBC_superior_to_LR-HSQC_Influence_of_homonuclear_couplings_JHH'_on_the_intensity_of_long-range_correlations","335164951_Minimizing_the_Risk_of_Deducing_Wrong_Natural_Product_Structures_from_NMR_Data","332516405_Enhancing_the_utility_of_1_J_CH_coupling_constants_in_structural_studies_through_optimized_DFT_analysis","332477537_The_role_of_computer-assisted_structure_elucidation_CASE_programs_in_the_structure_elucidation_of_complex_natural_products","329657162_Application_of_anisotropic_NMR_parameters_to_the_confirmation_of_molecular_structure","322407568_Computer-Assisted_3D_Structure_Elucidation_CASE-3D_of_Natural_Products_Combining_Isotropic_and_Anisotropic_NMR_Parameters","319177360_Towards_unbiased_and_more_versatile_NMR-based_structure_elucidation_A_powerful_combination_of_CASE_algorithms_and_DFT_calculations"]}
