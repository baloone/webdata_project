{"id":"308791998_EEQuest_An_Event_Extraction_and_Query_System","abstract":"We present EEQuest, an application that extracts events from text using natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine-learning techniques, and provides a system to query events extracted from a text corpus.\nWe provide a use case for the application wherein we extract business-related events from news articles. The extracted events are then categorized based on the business organization/company that they are related to. Finally, the events are added to a knowledge base using which a query system is built. The system can be used to display events related to a particular organization or a group of organizations. Although we are using the system to extract business-related events, the event extraction mechanism can be used in a more general sense with any available textual data, to extract any kind of events that have a structure that can answer the question: Who did what, when and where?","authors":["Prerit Jain","Haripriya Bendapudi","Shrisha Rao"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2998476.2998482","Conference: ACM COMPUTE '16: 9th Annual ACM India ConferenceAt: Gandhinagar, Gujarat"],"references":["282362682_Complex_event_extraction_from_real-time_news_streams","272091377_The_Stanford_CoreNLP_Natural_Language_Processing_Toolkit","262210116_Ontology-Based_Information_and_Event_Extraction_for_Business_Intelligence","256326897_API_design_for_machine_learning_software_Experiences_from_the_scikit-learn_project","254759133_An_overview_of_event_extraction_from_text","221474287_Real-Time_News_Event_Extraction_for_Global_Crisis_Monitoring","329977419_Latent_Structures_for_Coreference_Resolution","329977418_Exploiting_Parallel_News_Streams_for_Unsupervised_Event_Extraction","283824538_Plug_Latent_Structures_and_Play_Coreference_Resolution","221012950_Identifying_Relations_for_Open_Information_Extraction"]}
