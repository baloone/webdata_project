{"id":"320646650_Using_Formal_Model_for_Evaluation_of_Business_Processes_Elasticity_in_the_Cloud","abstract":"As it has been the case with other technologies, the availability of Service-based Business Processes (SBPs) in the Cloud allows imagining new usage scenarios. Typically, these scenarios include the execution of thousands of processes during a very short period of time requiring temporarily a very important amount of resources. Novel and innovative approaches for modeling of business processes should be developed to allow supporting these scenarios and others in a safer and cost-effective way. For instance, it is necessary to define strategies to scale resource consumed by business processes up and down to ensure their adaptation to the workload changes. In this paper, we focus on how to model and evaluate SBPs elasticity strategies. We propose an analytical model based on queuing model with variable number of servers to represent SBPs adaptation to demandsâ€™ variation. We consider a queuing model as Markov chain to evaluate elasticity strategies in the steady state, and to calculate the indices of performance. Our analytical model allows Cloud providers to evaluate and decide about the elasticity strategy to consider before implementing it in real environments.","authors":["Lydia Yataghene","Malika Ioualalen","Mourad Amziani","Samir Tata"],"meta":["October 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-68136-8_3","Conference: International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing"],"references":["261346598_On_Elasticity_and_Constrainedness_of_Business_Services_Provisioning","261236507_Modeling_Performance_of_Elasticity_Rules_for_Cloud-Based_Applications","261059315_Formal_Modeling_of_Elastic_Service-Based_Business_Processes","259891756_Formal_Modeling_and_Evaluation_of_Service-Based_Business_Process_Elasticity_in_the_Cloud","259891465_A_Generic_Framework_for_Service-Based_Business_Process_Elasticity_in_the_Cloud","232617598_Two-Tier_Multi-tenancy_Scaling_and_Load_Balancing","228859547_A_decision_making_framework_for_dynamic_service_deployment","224248869_Performance_Analysis_of_Cloud_Computing_Centers_Using_MGmmr_Queuing_Systems","221210837_Autonomic_mix-aware_provisioning_for_non-stationary_data_center_workloads","220948662_A_Framework_for_Dynamic_Service_Adaptation_in_the_Grid_Next_Generation_Software_Program_Progress_Report","286670489_A_Queuing_Model_for_Business_Processes_Elasticity_Evaluation","260203633_A_Queueing_Model_to_Achieve_Proper_Elasticity_for_Cloud_Cluster_Jobs"]}
