{"id":"328459996_Predicting_Freezing_of_Gait_in_Parkinsons_Disease_Patients_Using_Machine_Learning","abstract":"Abstract— Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most alarming\nmotor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, most commonly\nexperienced by subjects who have suffered from the disease for a\nlong period of time. Furthermore, freezing of gait can lead to\nfalls and may result to nursing home admissions which can\nnegatively affect the quality of life for patients, in addition to\nraising a broader set of socioeconomic consequences. In this\nresearch, machine learning algorithms are utilised as means of\nidentifying the freezing of gait event prior to its onset. An\naccelerometer time series dataset containing 237 individual\nFreezing of Gait events over 8 patients was considered, from\nwhich features were extracted and presented to 7 machine\nlearning classifiers. Our simulation results indicated that\nmachine learning algorithms are powerful tools for the early\nprediction of freezing of gait, capable of obtaining high sensitivity\nand specificity for the identification of the onset of Freezing of\nGait. Support Vector Machines with Polynomial kernel achieved\nthe highest performance in comparison with the benchmarked\ntechniques. The classification algorithm was applied to 5 second\nwindows using 18 features, obtaining balanced accuracies (the\nmean value of sensitivity and specificity) of 91%, 90%, and 82%\nover the Walk, FoG and Transition classes, respectively.","authors":["Natasa Kleanthous","Abir Hussain","Robert Keight","Paulo J.
