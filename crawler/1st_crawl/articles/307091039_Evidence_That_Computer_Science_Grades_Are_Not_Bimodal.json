{"id":"307091039_Evidence_That_Computer_Science_Grades_Are_Not_Bimodal","abstract":"Computing education researchers have become increasingly interested in leveraging log data automatically collected within computer programming environments in order to understand students' learning processes and tailor instruction to student needs. While data on students' programming activities has been positively correlated with their learning outcomes, those data tell only part of the story. Another part of the story lies in students' social activities, which, according to social learning theory, can also be predictive of students' learning outcomes. In order to gain further insight into how computing students' learning processes influence their learning outcomes, we present an empirical study that explores the interplay of students' social activities, programming activities, and course outcomes in an early computing course. By analyzing log data collected through a programming environment augmented with a social networking-style activity stream, we found that answers to questions posed through the activity stream were positively correlated with students' ability to make programming progress, and their eventual success in the course. Based on our findings, we present recommendations for the design of pedagogical environments to support a more social programming process.","authors":["Elizabeth Patitsas","Jesse Berlin","Michelle Craig","Steve Easterbrook"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1145/2960310.2960312","Conference: the 2016 ACM Conference"],"references":["270962854_Expectations_of_Brilliance_Underlie_Gender_Distributions_Across_Academic_Disciplines","267205556_Power_Comparisons_of_Shapiro-Wilk_Kolmogorov-Smirnov_Lilliefors_and_Anderson-Darling_Tests","266660882_Predicting_student_success_using_fine_grain_clicker_data","262236925_Towards_a_taxonomy_of_errors_in_HTML_and_CSS","262212097_Geek_genes_prior_knowledge_stumbling_points_and_learning_edge_momentum_Parts_of_the_one_elephant","234794475_COMPUTING_EDUCATION_RESEARCH_Geek_genes_and_bimodal_grades","49668532_STEMing_the_Tide_Using_Ingroup_Experts_to_Inoculate_Women's_Self-Concept_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_STEM","4986645_Is_Human_Height_Bimodal","319393753_Semantics_---_Wikipedia_The_Free_Encyclopedia","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","311491368_As_CS_Enrollments_Grow_Are_We_Attracting_Weaker_Students","291069751_Motivated_Numeracy_and_Enlightened_Self-Government","287391362_Learner-Centered_Design_of_Computing_Education_Research_on_Computing_for_Everyone","285713979_Thinking_in_Systems_A_Primer","282004300_The_Mismeasure_of_Man","275700552_The_affirmative_action_stigma_of_incompetence_Effects_of_performance_information_ambiguity","260975697_Women_Scientists_in_America_Struggles_and_Strategies_to_1940","247928701_Reviewing_CS1_exam_question_content","246676294_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Practice","243507322_The_Mismeasure_of_Man","233773909_Handbook_of_Biological_Statistics_2nd_Edition","228450176_Stepping_up_to_integrative_questions_on_CS1_exams","227620703_A_Decade_of_System_Justification_Theory_Accumulated_Evidence_of_Conscious_and_Unconscious_Bolstering_of_the_Status_Quo","222528580_Mental_control_and_visual_illusions_Toward_explaining_race-biased_weapon_misidentifications","220612744_Attitudes_and_beliefs_about_computer_science_among_students_and_faculty","220040555_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Participation","21114777_Bias_in_Interpretation_of_Ambiguous_Sentences_Related_to_Threat_in_Anxiety"]}
