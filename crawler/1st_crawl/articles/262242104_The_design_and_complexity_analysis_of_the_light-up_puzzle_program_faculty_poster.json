{"id":"262242104_The_design_and_complexity_analysis_of_the_light-up_puzzle_program_faculty_poster","abstract":"The purpose of this project was to use the McCabe IQ tool to analyze source code complexity of the Light-up Puzzle program. The McCabe IQ tool is software used in quality assurance for code analysis. It can allow people to determine if any parts of the source code are unreliable or unmaintainable without the user having to look at the source code. This can save both time and money as well as improve the quality of software code in businesses. Basically what the tool does is convert the source code into a graph, which it then uses to analyze the source code. The features of the tool that were used in this project are the Battlemap, System Complexity metrics, method flowgraphs, scatter diagrams, Halstead metrics, Class metrics, and Object-oriented metrics.","authors":["Douglas Selent"],"meta":["June 2011"],"references":["237335431_Structured_Testing_A_Testing_Methodology_Using_the_Cyclomatic_Complexity_Metric"]}
