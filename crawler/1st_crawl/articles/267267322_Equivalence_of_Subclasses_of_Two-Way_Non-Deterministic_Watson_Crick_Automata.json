{"id":"267267322_Equivalence_of_Subclasses_of_Two-Way_Non-Deterministic_Watson_Crick_Automata","abstract":"Watson Crick automata are finite automata working on double strands. Extensive research work has already been done on non deterministic Watson Crick automata and on deterministic Watson Crick automata. Parallel Communicating Watson Crick automata systems have been introduced by E. Czeziler et al. In this paper we discuss about a variant of Watson Crick automata known as the two-way Watson Crick automata which are more powerful than non-deterministic Watson Crick automata. We also establish the equivalence of different subclasses of two-way Watson crick automata. We further show that recursively enumerable (RE) languages can be realized by an image of generalized sequential machine (gsm) mapping of two-way Watson-Crick automata.","authors":["Kumar Sankar Ray","Kingshuk Chatterjee","Debayan Ganguly"],"meta":["July 2013Applied Mathematics VOL 410A(2013):26-34","DOI:10.4236/am.2013.410A1005"],"references":["220486529_Multi-Head_Finite_Automata_Characterizations_Concepts_and_Open_Problems","31596781_A_Short_Survey_on_Watson-Crick_Automata","223686325_On_the_power_of_parallel_communicating_Watson-Crick_automata_systems","222521501_On_the_descriptional_complexity_of_Watson-Crick_automata","221212491_The_Role_of_the_Complementarity_Relation_in_Watson-Crick_Automata_and_Sticker_Systems","31593958_DNA_Computing_New_Computing_Paradigms","2701481_Molecular_Computation_Of_Solutions_To_Combinatorial_Problems"]}
