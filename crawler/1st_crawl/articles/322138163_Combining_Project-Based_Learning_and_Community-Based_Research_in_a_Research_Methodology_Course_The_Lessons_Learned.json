{"id":"322138163_Combining_Project-Based_Learning_and_Community-Based_Research_in_a_Research_Methodology_Course_The_Lessons_Learned","abstract":"In this article, we present our findings regarding the course \"Research Methodology,\" offered to 22 first-year undergraduate students studying Administration at the Federal University of São Paulo, Osasco, Brazil. The course, which combined community-based research and project-based learning, was developed during the second semester of 2016. The students worked in teams to do research on a particular aspect of an NGO that helped people in need. The NGO was selected from a list of organizations that agreed to work as community partners. The students did qualitative research, which they then wrote up as a standard research paper for publication in a journal. Our research objective was to study the advantages and disadvantages of combining community-based research and project-based learning in research methodology courses. We followed a mixed-method research approach, analyzing the students' responses to a survey and focus group activities. Our main findings were as follows: 1) The students faced difficulties working in groups, scheduling meetings with the community partners, and creating the articles; 2) The project-based learning approach improved the students' learning; 3) Doing community-based research was rich and meaningful experience to the students; 4) The course was successful in developing the students' research skills.","authors":["João Alberto Arantes do Amaral","Rebeca Júlia Rodrigues Lino dos Santos"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Instruction 11(1):47-60","DOI:10.12973/iji.2018.1114a","Project: Community-based learning"],"references":["321106334_Creating_a_Project-Based_Learning_Environment_to_Improve_Project_Management_Skills_of_Graduate_Students","321106328_The_Use_of_System_Thinking_Concepts_in_Order_to_Assure_Continuous_Improvement_of_Project_Based_Learning_Courses","313630118_The_rework_cycle_how_it_really_works_and_reworks","284329269_Principles_of_Best_Practice_for_Community-Based_Research","251774209_Teaching_Research_Methods_to_Undergraduate_Psychology_Students_Using_an_Active_Cooperative_Learning_Approach","321275099_Research_design_qualitative_quantitative_and_mixed_methods_approaches","303129353_University_students'_support_to_an_NGO_that_helps_children_with_cancer_Lessons_learned_in_thirteen_academic_projects","297676405_The_dynamics_of_connecting_universities_non-governmental_organizations_and_community_members_by_means_of_academic_projects_directed_at_people_in_need","279941252_Seven_essentials_for_project-based_learning","270327721_Learning_by_Doing_Group_Projects_in_Research_Methods_Classes"]}
