{"id":"226574739_A_Simple_Fast_Hybrid_Pattern-Matching_Algorithm","abstract":"The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) pattern-matching algorithm guarantees both independence from alphabet size and worst-case execution\ntime linear in the pattern length; on the other hand, the Boyer-Moore (BM) algorithm provides near-optimal average-case and\nbest-case behaviour, as well as executing very fast in practice. We describe a simple algorithm that employs the main ideas\nof KMP and BM (with a little help from Sunday) in an effort to combine these desirable features. Experiments indicate that\nin practice the new algorithm is among the fastest exact pattern-matching algorithms discovered to date, perhaps dominant\nfor alphabet size 8 or more.","authors":["Frantisek Franek","Christopher G.
