{"id":"314593397_Dynamic_Load_Sharing_to_Maximize_Resource_Utilization_Within_Cloud_Federation","abstract":"It is evident in recent years that cloud has resource constraints. Client requests are at the highest priority of cloud services. Denial of client services will not only hamper profits but also tarnish reputation of the provider. In these cases an effort can be made to provision resources from the other cloud providers so that they can serve the request using their unused resources. In this way the idea of cloud federation has emerged. The idea is, if a cloud saturates its computational and storage resources, or it is requested to use resources in a geography where it has no footprint, it would still be able to satisfy such requests for service allocations sent from its clients. Our work contributes by offering a model for enacting the cloud federation. More precisely, we have introduced a cloud broker which decides whether a job sent to a particular cloud provider should be served there or routed to another provider. Our proposed model selects the best option to outsource the request without violating Service Layer Agreement (SLA).","authors":["Zulkar Nine","Md.
