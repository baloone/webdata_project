{"id":"341163446_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_hologram_of_line-drawn_objects_without_FFT","abstract":"Although holographic display technology is one of the most promising three-dimensional (3D) display technologies for virtual and augmented reality, the enormous computational effort required to produce computer-generated holograms (CGHs) to digitally record and display 3D images presents a significant roadblock to the implementation of this technology. One of the most effective methods to implement fast CGH calculations is a diffraction calculation (e.g., angular spectrum diffraction) based on the fast-Fourier transform (FFT). Unfortunately, the computational complexity increases with increasing CGH resolution, which is what determines the size of a 3D image. Therefore, enormous calculations are still required to display a reasonably sized 3D image, even for a simple 3D image. To address this issue, we propose herein a fast CGH algorithm for 3D objects comprised of line-drawn objects at layers of different depths. An aperture formed from a continuous line at a single depth can be regarded as a series of aligned point sources of light, and the wavefront converges for a sufficiently long line. Thus, a CGH of a line-drawn object can be calculated by synthesizing converged wavefronts along the line. Numerical experiments indicate that, compared with the FFT-based method, the proposed method offers a factor-56 gain in speed for calculating 16-k-resolution CGHs from 3D objects composed of twelve line-drawn objects at different depths.","authors":["Takashi Nishitsuji","Tomoyoshi Shimobaba","Takashi Kakue","Tomoyoshi Ito"],"meta":["May 2020Optics Express 28(11)","DOI:10.1364/OE.389778"],"references":["334776543_Direct_calculation_of_computer-generated_holograms_in_sparse_bases","332779566_Lateral_and_axial_resolution_criteria_in_incoherent_and_coherent_optics_and_holography_near-_And_far-field_regimes","323366936_Digital_holography_and_its_multidimensional_imaging_applications_A_review","322459256_Accelerated_computer_generated_holography_using_sparse_bases_in_the_STFT_domain","283013079_Accurate_calculation_of_computer-generated_holograms_using_angular-spectrum_layer-oriented_method","280242671_Improved_layer-based_method_for_rapid_hologram_generation_and_real-time_interactive_holographic_display_applications","233975824_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_hologram_using_the_circular_symmetry_of_zone_plates","224141855_State_of_the_Art_in_Holographic_Displays_A_Survey","51193391_Calculation_for_computer_generated_hologram_using_ray-sampling_plane","40443384_Extremely_high-definition_full-parallax_computer-generated_hologram_created_by_the_polygon-based_method","10571736_Fast_calculation_method_for_optical_diffraction_on_tilted_planes_by_use_of_the_angular_spectrum_of_plane_waves","5497179_Recurrence_Formulas_for_Fast_Creation_of_Synthetic_Three-Dimensional_Holograms","2766592_Interactive_Computation_of_Holograms_Using_a_Look-Up_Table","337123880_Holographic_near-eye_displays_based_on_overlap-add_stereograms","326387875_Fast_generation_of_full_analytical_polygon-based_computer-generated_holograms","325803005_Accelerated_synthesis_of_wide-viewing_angle_polygon_computer-generated_holograms_using_the_interocular_affine_similarity_of_three-dimensional_scenes","321173073_Ultrafast_layer_based_computer-generated_hologram_calculation_with_sparse_template_holographic_fringe_pattern_for_3-D_object","314185617_Large_real-time_holographic_3D_displays_Enabling_components_and_results","312265061_Fast_generation_of_computer-generated_holograms_using_wavelet_shrinkage","298731682_Fast_method_of_calculating_a_photorealistic_hologram_based_on_orthographic_ray-wavefront_conversion","286489089_Simple_and_fast_cosine_approximation_method_for_computer-generated_hologram_calculation","274730893_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_hologram_using_run-length_encoding_based_recurrence_relation","273793416_Fast_generation_of_digital_holograms_based_on_warping_of_the_wavefront_recording_plane","266973381_Fast_one-step_calculation_of_holographic_videos_of_three-dimensional_scenes_by_combined_use_of_baseline_and_depth-compensating_principal_fringe_patterns","249655825_Computer-generated_holograms_of_tilted_planes_by_a_spatial_frequency_approach","236139055_Fast_computation_of_hologram_patterns_of_a_3D_object_using_run-length_encoding_and_novel_look-up_table_methods","226201786_Fast_Computation_of_Fresnel_Holograms_Employing_Difference","223470648_Special-purpose_computer_for_holography_HORN-4_with_recurrence_algorithm","221094439_A_QoE_Fuzzy_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","51927946_Computational_wave_optics_library_for_C_CWO_library","38019397_Simple_and_fast_calculation_algorithm_for_computer-generated_hologram_with_wavefront_recording_plane","5611642_Digital_holographic_microscopy_for_live_cell_applications_and_technical_inspection","5257950_Effective_generation_of_digital_holograms_of_three-dimensional_objects_using_a_novel_look-up_table_method"]}
