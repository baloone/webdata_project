{"id":"326237108_A_distributed_dendritic_cell_algorithm_for_big_data","abstract":"In this work, we focus on the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA), a bio-inspired classifier, and its limitation when coping with very large datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel distributed DCA version for data classification based on the MapReduce framework to distribute the functioning of this algorithm through a cluster of computing elements. Our experimental results show that our proposed distributed solution is suitable to enhance the performance of the DCA enabling the algorithm to be applied over big data classification problems.","authors":["Zaineb Chelly Dagdia"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1145/3205651.3205701","Conference: the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion"],"references":["282157903_A_Survey_of_the_Dendritic_Cell_Algorithm","220451774_A_Fast_Parallel_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Large_Spatial_Databases","297582750_Large_Scale_Distributed_Data_Science_using_Apache_Spark"]}
