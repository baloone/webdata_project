{"id":"222559523_Approximately_dominating_representatives","abstract":"We propose and investigate from the algorithmic standpoint a novel form of fuzzy query called approximately dominating representatives or ADRs. The ADRs of a multidimensional point set consist of a few points guaranteed to contain an approximate optimum of any monotone Lipschitz continuous combining function of the dimensions. ADRs can be computed by appropriately post-processing Pareto, or “skyline”, queries [Kian-Lee Tan, Pin-Kwang Eng, Beng Chin Ooi, Efficient progressive skyline computation, in: VLDB, 2001, pp. 301–310; Wolf-Tilo Balke, Ulrich Güntzer, Jason Xin Zheng, Efficient distributed skylining for web information systems, in: EDBT, 2004. [14]]. We show that the problem of minimizing the number of points returned, for a user-specified desired approximation, can be solved in polynomial time in two dimensions; for three and more it is NP-hard but has a polynomial-time logarithmic approximation. Finally, we present a polynomial-time, constant factor approximation algorithm for three dimensions.","authors":["Vladlen Koltun","Christos H.
