{"id":"259503979_Event-based_consensus_of_multi-agent_systems_with_general_linear_models","abstract":"In this paper, the event-based consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems is considered. Two sufficient conditions with or without continuous communication between neighboring agents are presented to guarantee the consensus. The advantage of the event-based strategy is the significant decrease of the number of controller updates for cooperative tasks of multi-agent systems involving embedded microprocessors with limited on-board resources. The controller updates of each agent are driven by properly defined events, which depend on the measurement error, the states of its neighboring agents and an arbitrarily small threshold. It is shown that the controller updates for each agent only trigger at its own event time instants. A simulation example is presented to illustrate the theoretical results.","authors":["Wei Zhu","Zhong-Ping Jiang","Gang Feng"],"meta":["January 2013Automatica 50(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2013.11.023"],"references":["260661599_Consensus_of_Multi-Agent_Networks_With_Aperiodic_Sampled_Communication_Via_Impulsive_Algorithms_Using_Position-Only_Measurements","256660888_Distributed_event-triggered_control_of_multi-agent_systems_with_combinational_measurements","254058680_Distributed_Event-Triggered_Control_for_Multi-Agent_Systems","254054693_Distributed_Event-Based_Control_for_Interconnected_Linear_Systems","245585591_Distributed_Consensus_in_Multi-Vehicle_Cooperative_Control_Theory_and_Applications","229086446_An_Overview_of_Recent_Progress_in_the_Study_of_Distributed_Multi-Agent_Coordination","228784587_Event-triggered_cooperative_control","224252140_Decentralized_Event-Triggered_Control_Over_Wireless_SensorActuator_Networks","224156506_Event-Triggering_in_Distributed_Networked_Control_Systems","224112852_Necessary_and_Sufficient_Conditions_for_Consensusability_of_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems","221044447_Event-triggered_Control_for_Multi-Agent_Systems","3032094_Beard_RW_Consensus_seeking_in_multiagent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies_IEEE_Trans_Autom_Control_505_655-661","325916347_Event-triggered_cooperative_control","313691249_Consensus_seeking_in_multi-agent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies","298091779_Cooperative_Control_of_Distributed_Multi-Agent_Systems","285676380_Analysis_and_Design_of_Nonlinear_Control_Systems","266840063_Event_Based_Control","260516272_Maximum_Allowable_Loss_Probability_for_Consensus_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_Over_Random_Weighted_Lossy_Networks","256660866_Event-based_broadcasting_for_multi-agent_average_consensus","234139286_Robust_Stability_of_a_Multi-Agent_System_Under_Arbitrary_and_Time-Varying_Communication_Topologies_and_Communication_Delays","224739998_Comparison_of_Riemann_and_Lebesgue_sampling_for_first_order_stochastic_systems","224259034_Cooperative_Output_Regulation_of_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems","224079973_Global_Analysis_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_Based_on_Vicsek's_Model","220387411_Sampled-Data_Based_Consensus_of_Continuous-Time_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Time-Varying_Topology","220159612_Event-based_control_A_state-feedback_approach","220158815_An_Internal_Model_Principle_is_necessary_and_sufficient_for_linear_output_synchronization","220157221_Brief_paper_Leader-following_consensus_of_second-order_agents_with_multiple_time-varying_delays","4006465_Coordination_of_groups_of_mobile_autonomous_agents_using_nearest_neighbor","3032863_Event-Triggered_Real-Time_Scheduling_of_Stabilizing_Control_Tasks","3031499_Coordination_of_Groups_of_Mobile_Autonomous_Agents_Using_Nearest_Neighbor_Rules"]}
