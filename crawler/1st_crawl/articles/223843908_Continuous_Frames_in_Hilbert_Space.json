{"id":"223843908_Continuous_Frames_in_Hilbert_Space","abstract":"The standard theory of frames in Hilbert spaces, using discrete bases, is generalized to one where the basis vectors may be labelled using discrete, continuous, or a mixture of the two types of indices. A comprehensive analysis of such frames is presented and various notions of equivalence among frames are introduced. A consideration of the relationschip between reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and frames leads to an exhaustive construction for all possible frames in a separable Hilbert space. Generalizations of the theory are indicated and illustrated by an example drawn from the afline group.","authors":["Syed Twareque Ali","Jean-Pierre Antoine","Jean-Pierre Gazeau"],"meta":["February 1993Annals of Physics 222(1):1-37","DOI:10.1006/aphy.1993.1016"],"references":["312831986_Signal_processing_and_compression_with_wavelet_packets","253864582_Transforms_associated_to_square_integrable_group_representations_I_General_results","252340981_Painless_Nonorthogonal_Expansions","316807861_Stochastic_Quantum_Mechanics_and_Quantum_Spacetime","314118879_An_Introduction_to_the_Analysis_and_Processing_of_Signals","300223638_Stochastic_Quantum_Mechanics_on_Phase_Space","267474959_Quantum_mechanics_and_coherent_states_on_the_anti-de_Sitter_spacetime_and_their_Poincare_contraction","259013109_Differential_Geometry_Group_Representations_and_Quantization","253971058_Vector_coherent_state_theory_and_its_application_to_the_orthogonal_groups","247053852_Ondelettes_et_Operateurs_III"]}
