{"id":"332542045_A_Tour_Towards_the_Various_Knowledge_Representation_Techniques_for_Cognitive_Hybrid_Sentence_Modeling_and_Analyzer","abstract":"Knowledge Representation (KR) is a fascinating field across several areas of cognitive science and computer science. It is very hard to identify the requirement of a combination of many techniques and inference mechanism to achieve the accuracy for the problem domain. This research attempted to examine those techniques, and to apply them to implement a Cognitive Hybrid Sentence Modeling and Analyzer. The purpose of developing this system is to facilitate people who face the problem of using English language in daily life.","authors":["Poonam Tanwar","T. V.
