{"id":"339423401_EFL_learners'_metacognitive_development_in_flipped_learning_a_comparative_study","abstract":"This study adopts a qualitative method in comparing EFL students’ development of metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive strategy use in a university flipped classroom, as opposed to a regular classroom context. A total of 8 students (4 from each class) were each interviewed twice, once at the beginning and again at the end of the semester, in semi-structured interviews. Findings show that, in the context of a flipped classroom, learners’ metacognitive knowledge had undergone qualitative changes over the course of a semester. Similarly, the flipped classroom design had led to a more active, deeper use of metacognitive strategies. Finally, implications for teaching and further research are discussed.","authors":["Hui-Chia Shih","Sheng-hui Cindy Huang"],"meta":["February 2020Interactive Learning Environments","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2020.1728343"],"references":["328046693_The_effectiveness_of_the_student_response_system_SRS_in_English_grammar_learning_in_a_flipped_English_as_a_foreign_language_EFL_class","288443155_The_Definition_of_Blended_Learning_in_Higher_Education","283805990_Why_No_Difference_A_Controlled_Flipped_Classroom_Study_for_an_Introductory_Differential_Equations_Course","283014360_Using_the_flipped_classroom_to_enhance_EFL_learning","279301902_Flipped-Class_Pedagogy_Enhances_Student_Metacognition_and_Collaborative-Learning_Strategies_in_Higher_Education_But_Effect_Does_Not_Persist","274710464_Developing_Students'_Metacognitive_Knowledge_and_Skills","247502531_Inquiry_Modeling_and_Metacognition_Making_Science_Accessible_to_All_Students","233203583_Assessment_and_Learning_Differences_and_Relationships_between_Formative_and_Summative_Assessment","227166212_Promoting_General_Metacognitive_Awareness","226800366_A_broad_BACEIS_for_improving_thinking","225989076_Relations_Between_Teachers'_Approaches_to_Teaching_and_Students'_Approaches_to_Learning","223290508_The_effects_of_explicit_teaching_of_metastrategic_knowledge_on_low-_and_high-achieving_students","200772570_Reciprocal_teaching_of_comprehension-fostering_and_monitoring_activities","331885520_College_students'_metacognitive_strategy_use_in_an_EFL_flipped_classroom","330234297_Adoption_of_flipped_learning_in_social_humanities_education_the_FIBER_experience_in_secondary_schools","323641822_Metacognition_and_Metacognitive_Instruction_in_Second_Language_Writing_Classrooms","323372080_An_immersive_flipped_classroom_for_learning_Mandarin_Chinese_design_implementation_and_outcomes","321701758_Applying_First_Principles_of_Instruction_as_a_design_theory_of_the_flipped_classroom_Findings_from_a_collective_study_of_four_secondary_school_subjects","320996978_Designing_a_technology-enhanced_flipped_learning_system_to_facilitate_students'_self-regulation_and_performance","318605280_An_examination_of_undergraduates'_metacognitive_strategies_in_pre-class_asynchronous_activity_in_a_flipped_classroom","314981023_Perceptions_of_senior-year_ELT_students_for_flipped_classroom_a_materials_development_course","308957955_Self-regulated_learning_strategies_predict_learner_behavior_and_goal_attainment_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_In_press","303097275_A_self-regulated_flipped_classroom_approach_to_improving_students'_learning_performance_in_a_mathematics_course","299133056_The_effect_of_the_flipped_classroom_approach_to_OpenCourseWare_instruction_on_students'_self-regulation","281198052_The_Taxonomy_of_Metacognition","274434507_The_Flipped_Class_A_Method_to_Address_the_Challenges_of_an_Undergraduate_Statistics_Course","269417989_Flipping_the_classroom_for_English_language_learners_to_foster_active_learning","262814104_Factors_affecting_metacognition_of_undergraduate_nursing_students_in_a_blended_learning_environment","256085115_Medical_Education_Reimagined_A_Call_to_Action","248983139_Learning-to-learn_strategies_as_a_basis_for_effective_lifelong_learning","242670371_The_Role_of_Metacognitive_Knowledge_in_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing","240114612_Metacognitive_Awareness_and_Second_Language_Listeners","232868292_Raising_L2_listeners'_metacognitive_awareness_A_sociocultural_theory_perspective","232599909_Metacognition_and_Cognitive_Monitoring_A_New_Area_of_Cognitive-Developmental_Inquiry","227602175_The_Big_Picture_Understanding_learning_and_meta-learning_challenges","226753677_Metacognition_Abilities_and_Developing_Expertise_What_Makes_an_Expert_Student","225617305_Designing_metacognitive_activities"]}
