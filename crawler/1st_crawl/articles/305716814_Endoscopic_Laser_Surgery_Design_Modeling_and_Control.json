{"id":"305716814_Endoscopic_Laser_Surgery_Design_Modeling_and_Control","abstract":"This paper deals with the design, modeling, and control of a compact endoscopic tip for laser steering. It consists of a two-degree-of-freedom microrobotic device based on two linear piezoelectric motors associated with a deformable microfabricated silicon mirror. The proposed device is integrated into an endoscopic tip for microrobot-assisted vocal fold laser microsurgery. The laser motions on the target tissue are controlled using the microrobot device and through a path-following scheme combined with a visual servoing controller. Indeed, the surgeon defines, using a tablet, a path to be followed automatically by the laser at high frequency and under a predefined fixed velocity. The developed device was validated successfully in both realist testbench and preclinical cadaver trials.","authors":["Rupert Renevier","Tamadazte Brahim","Kanty Rabenorosoa","Laurent Tavernier"],"meta":["January 2016IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics 22(1):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMECH.2016.2595625"],"references":["286604289_Weakly_calibrated_stereoscopic_visual_servoing_for_laser_steering_Application_to_phonomicrosurgery","282203956_Laser_steering_using_virtual_trifocal_visual_servoing","274404244_Decoupling_Path_Following_and_Velocity_Profile_in_Vision-Guided_Laser_Steering","273296298_Robotic_Cell_Manipulation_Using_Optical_Tweezers_With_Unknown_Trapping_Stiffness_and_Limited_FOV","313647547_Design_of_a_Piezoelectric-Driven_Tilt_Mirror_for_a_Fast_Laser_Scanner","290217975_Endoscopy_of_Larynx_and_Trachea_with_Rigid_Laryngo-_Tracheoscopes_Under_Superimposed_High-Frequency_Jet_Ventilation_SHFJV","288073319_Flexible_Robot_for_Laser_Phonomicrosurgery","287176349_Laser-Assisted_Microphonosurgery","281369543_Squipabot_A_Mesoscale_Parallel_Robot_for_a_Laser_Phonosurgery","273430920_Suspension_laryngoscopy_for_endotracheal_stenting"]}
