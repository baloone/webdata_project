{"id":"329901588_Next_Generation_Technology_for_EpidemicPrevention_and_Control_Data-Driven_Contact_Tracking","abstract":"Contact tracking is one of the key technologies in prevention and control of infectious diseases. In the face of a sudden infectious disease outbreak, contact tracking systems can help medical professionals quickly locate and isolate infected persons and high-risk individuals, preventing further spread and a large-scale outbreak of infectious disease. Furthermore, the transmission networks of infectious diseases established using contact tracking technology can aid in the visualization of actual virus transmission paths, which enables simulations and predictions of the transmission process, assessment of the outbreak trend, and further development and deployment of more effective prevention and control strategies. Exploring effective contact tracking methods will be significant. Governments, academics, and industries have all given extensive attention to this goal. In this paper, we review the developments and challenges of current contact tracing technologies regarding individual and group contact from both static and dynamic perspectives, including static individual contact tracing, dynamic individual contact tracing, static group contact tracing, dynamic group contact tracing. With the purpose of providing useful reference and inspiration for researchers and practitioners in related fields, directions in multi-view contact tracing, multi-scale contact tracing, and AI-based contact tracing are provided for next generation technologies for epidemic prevention and control.","authors":["Hechang Chen","Bo Yang","Hongbin Pei","Jiming Liu"],"meta":["December 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2882915"],"references":["326137432_Inferencing_Human_Spatiotemporal_Mobility_in_Greater_Maputo_via_Mobile_Phone_Big_Data_Mining","324172208_Mobile_Sensing_in_Environmental_Health_and_Neighborhood_Research","320882173_Multi-view_Clustering_with_Graph_Embedding_for_Connectome_Analysis","319168759_Insights_From_Flutracking_Thirteen_Tips_to_Growing_a_Web-Based_Participatory_Surveillance_System","319017975_Mobility_assessment_of_a_rural_population_in_the_Netherlands_using_GPS_measurements","318376857_Computing_Urban_Traffic_Congestions_by_Incorporating_Sparse_GPS_Probe_Data_and_Social_Media_Data","330029118_A_Self-Organizing_Tensor_Architecture_for_Multi-view_Clustering","326968271_Partially_Observable_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Sustainable_Active_Surveillance_11th_International_Conference_KSEM_2018_Changchun_China_August_17-19_2018_Proceedings_Part_II","325479836_Broad_Learning_An_Emerging_Area_in_Social_Network_Analysis","317631775_Tracking_the_Cheetah_Tail_using_Animal-Borne_Cameras_GPS_and_an_IMU"]}
