{"id":"291206539_A_Multi-scale_Boosted_Detector_for_Efficient_and_Robust_Gesture_Recognition","abstract":"We present an approach to detecting and recognizing gestures in a stream of multi-modal data. Our approach combines a sliding-window gesture detector with features drawn from skeleton data, color imagery, and depth data produced by a first-generation Kinect sensor. The detector consists of a set of one-versus-all boosted classifiers, each tuned to a specific gesture. Features are extracted at multiple temporal scales, and include descriptive statistics of normalized skeleton joint positions, angles, and velocities, as well as image-based hand descriptors. The full set of gesture detectors may be trained in under two hours on a single machine, and is extremely efficient at runtime, operating at 1700fps using only skeletal data, or at 100fps using fused skeleton and image features. Our method achieved a Jaccard Index score of 0.834 on the ChaLearn-2014 Gesture Recognition Test dataset, and was ranked 2nd overall in the competition.","authors":["Camille Monnier","Stan German","Andrey Ost"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-16178-5_34","Conference: Workshop at the European Conference on Computer Vision"],"references":["302826933_Monocular_3D_pose_estimation_and_tracking_by_detection","261595794_Mixing_Body-Part_Sequences_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","257672334_Dense_Trajectories_and_Motion_Boundary_Descriptors_for_Action_Recognition","254058710_Microsoft_Kinect_Sensor_and_Its_Effect","224256248_Real-time_3D_hand_gesture_interaction_with_a_robot_for_understanding_directions_from_humans","224164350_New_Features_and_Insights_for_Pedestrian_Detection","221429990_Putting_the_pieces_together_Connected_Poselets_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","220659463_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_VOC_challenge","220320940_In_Defense_of_One-Vs-All_Classification","50999764_Hough_Forests_for_Object_Detection_Tracking_and_Action_Recognition","4156416_Robust_object_detection_via_soft_cascade","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","269132806_Does_Human_Action_Recognition_Benefit_from_Pose_Estimation","262235200_Fusing_multi-modal_features_for_gesture_recognition","261501729_Unconstrained_Monocular_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_by_Action_Detection_and_Cross-Modality_Regression_Forest","261283558_Learning_Latent_Temporal_Structure_for_Complex_Event_Detection","261276848_Action_Recognition_by_Hierarchical_Sequence_Summarization","258304769_Machine_Learning_Volume_45_Number_1_-_SpringerLink","239546749_Statistical_Learning_Theory","231040527_Continuous_Body_and_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_for_Natural_Human-Computer_Interaction","228598173_A_Short_Introduction_to_Boosting","221364410_Action_recognition_with_multiscale_spatio-temporal_contexts","221363090_Monocular_3D_Pose_Estimation_and_Tracking_by_Detection","221361842_Learning_Realistic_Human_Actions_from_Movies","221110114_Poselets_Body_Part_Detectors_Trained_Using_3D_Human_Pose_Annotations","220694713_Statistical_Learning_Theory","220611909_Poppe_R_A_Survey_on_Vision-based_Human_Action_Recognition_Image_and_Vision_Computing_286_976-990","220611062_Visual_recognition_of_pointing_gestures_for_humanrobot","51539292_Pedestrian_Detection_An_Evaluation_of_the_State_of_the_Art","3421786_Gesture_Recognition_A_Survey"]}
