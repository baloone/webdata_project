{"id":"325364725_Connectivity_and_some_other_properties_of_generalized_Sierpinski_graphs","abstract":"If G is a graph and n a positive integer, then the generalized Sierpiński graph SGⁿ is a fractal-like graph that uses G as a building block. The construction of SGⁿ generalizes the classical Sierpiński graphs Spⁿ, where the role of G is played by the complete graph Kp. An explicit formula for the number of connected components in SGⁿ is given and it is proved that the (edge-)connectivity of SGⁿ equals the (edge-)connectivity of G. It is demonstrated that SGⁿ contains a 1-factor if and only if G contains a 1-factor. Hamiltonicity of generalized Sierpiński graphs is also discussed.","authors":["Sandi Klavzar","Sara Sabrina Zemljič"],"meta":["October 2018Applicable Analysis and Discrete Mathematics 12(00):9-9","DOI:10.2298/AADM170206009K"],"references":["323565832_On_distances_in_generalized_Sierpinski_graphs","312280189_The_strong_metric_dimension_of_generalized_Sierpinski_graphs_with_pendant_vertices","305770072_On_distances_in_generalized_Sierpinski_graphs","303449004_On_the_Roman_domination_number_of_generalized_Sierpinski_graphs","301855257_Dominating_sequences_under_atomic_changes_with_applications_in_Sierpi'nski_and_interval_graphs","296688861_A_New_Proof_that_4-Connected_Planar_Graphs_are_Hamiltonian-Connected","283335471_On_the_General_Randic_index_of_polymeric_networks_modelled_by_generalized_Sierpinski_graphs","308978483_A_survey_and_classification_of_Sierpinski-type_graphs","308772555_Counting_the_Number_of_Perfect_Matchings_in_K_5-Free_Graphs","283619928_Graphs_that_are_simultaneously_efficient_open_domination_and_efficient_closed_domination_graphs","281525836_On_Generalized_Sierpi'nski_Graphs","273444084_On_the_Randic_Index_of_Polymeric_Networks_Modelled_by_Generalized_Sierpinski_Graphs","267627377_Dimer-monomer_Model_on_the_Towers_of_Hanoi_Graphs","282820879_Total_coloring_of_generalized_sierpinski_graphs","276113166_Lipschitz_equivalence_of_totally_disconnected_general_sierpinski_triangles"]}
