The patient’s\nhistory was obtained and several laboratory tests were\nperformed leading to the diagnosis of malaria caused by\nPlasmodium ovale. The rapid diagnostic test for malaria\nwas negative, and the Giemsa – stained peripheral blood\nsmears were positive for the presence of malarial\nparasites. Images of the peripheral blood smears were sent\nto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nwhich confirmed the presence of Plasmodium ovale. We\nalso report 5 other false negative RDTs for P. ovale in our\ninstitution in 2016, and the performance of RDTs for all\nmalaria cases during that year. This case demonstrates the\nimportance of obtaining multiple pieces of laboratory\ndata in order to accurately diagnose a patient with\nmalaria, illustrates that evaluation of Giemsa – stained\nperipheral blood smears is still the gold standard in the\nlaboratory diagnosis of malaria, and emphasizes the\nimportance for clinical laboratory scientists to maintain\nmaximum competency in peripheral blood smear\nevaluation for bloodborne parasites.","authors":["Seble Aregawi","Lei Li","Caterina Miraglia"],"meta":["March 2017Clinical laboratory science: journal of the American Society for Medical Technology 30(2):75-83","DOI:10.29074/ascls.30.2.75"],"references":["269170686_Performance_of_Rapid_Diagnostic_Tests_for_Plasmodium_ovale_Malaria_in_Japanese_Travellers","260252667_Evaluation_of_three_rapid_diagnostic_tests_for_the_detection_of_human_infections_with_Plasmodium_knowlesi","232611641_Use_of_Rapid_Diagnostic_Tests_in_Malaria_School_Surveys_in_Kenya_Does_their_Under-performance_Matter_for_Planning_Malaria_Control","51222033_Prozone_in_malaria_rapid_diagnostics_tests_How_many_cases_are_missed","12616676_Plasmodium_falciparum_Histidine-Rich_Protein_2-Based_Immunocapture_Diagnostic_Assay_for_Malaria_Cross-Reactivity_with_Rheumatoid_Factors","12102055_Persistent_ICT_Malaria_PfPv_Panmalarial_and_HRP2_Antigen_Reactivity_after_Treatment_of_Plasmodium_falciparum_Malaria_Is_Associated_with_Gametocytemia_and_Results_in_False-Positive_Diagnoses_of_Plasmod","8036425_Ineffectiveness_of_the_Binax_NOW_Malaria_Test_for_Diagnosis_of","5685058_A_Review_of_Malaria_Diagnostic_Tools_Microscopy_and_Rapid_Diagnostic_Test_RDT","235394140_Malaria_rapid_diagnostic_tests_in_travel_medicine","21714110_Early_radiology_at_the_University_of_Texas_Medical_Branch_Galveston","11577441_Rapid_Diagnostic_Tests_for_Malaria_Parasites","7723438_Plasmodium_ovale_Parasite_and_Disease"]}
