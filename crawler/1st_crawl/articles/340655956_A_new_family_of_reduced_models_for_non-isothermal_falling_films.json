{"id":"340655956_A_new_family_of_reduced_models_for_non-isothermal_falling_films","abstract":"New asymptotic models are formulated to capture the thermal transfer across falling films. These models enable us to simulate a wide range of Biot and Peclet number values, without displaying nonphysical behaviors. The models correctly capture the onset of the thermally developed regime at the inlet of the flow. To evaluate the parameter space of acceptability, a comparison has been made with the primitive equation solution for periodic boundary conditions, as well as for an open flow with a periodic forcing at the inlet. A good agreement is obtained for moderate to high Peclet numbers.","authors":["Nicolas Cellier","Christian Ruyer-Quil"],"meta":["April 2020International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 154(1):119700","DOI:10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.119700","Project: Falling film heat exchangers"],"references":["335434920_Robust_low-dimensional_modelling_of_falling_liquid_films_subject_to_variable_wall_heating","324909592_Thermal_falling_film_modelling_validation_and_exploration","342403595_Augmented_skew-symmetric_system_for_shallow-water_system_with_surface_tension_allowing_large_gradient_of_density","338121128_The_instability_of_liquid_films_with_temperature-dependent_properties_flowing_down_a_heated_incline","337662187_Effect_of_thermocapillary_instability_on_liquid_film_breakdown","336960761_Thermocapillary_rivulets_in_a_locally_heated_falling_liquid_film","328663249_Investigation_on_heat_transfer_characteristics_of_falling_liquid_film_by_planar_laser-induced_fluorescence","326080565_Optimisation_d'echangeurs_a_films_ruisselants","321133827_A_Comparison_of_Three_Methods_for_Selecting_Values_of_Input_Variables_in_the_Analysis_of_Output_from_a_Computer_Code","317247554_Influence_of_artificial_disturbances_on_characteristics_of_the_heated_liquid_film"]}
