{"id":"319161587_Automatic_scoring_system_for_short_descriptive_answer_written_in_Korean_using_lexico-semantic_pattern","abstract":"The researches on the automatic scoring system for English descriptive answers have been actively performed, but there are not so many researches on the automatic scoring system for Korean descriptive answers. In this paper, we propose an scoring method based on lexico-semantic pattern (LSP), which is known to be a good solution for the morphologically rich Korean language. In the proposed method, postposition information is utilized as an important tool for finding the meaning differences in Korean. In addition to using LSP, we also applied a synonym dictionary as a meaning extension approach to improve recall performance in scoring studentâ€™s answer. Our experimental result shows that the proposed system performs better than the existing noun-keyword-based system by 0.137. Also, the best performance could be obtained by using a synonym dictionary.","authors":["Jeong-Eun Kim","Kinam Park","Jeong-Min Chae","Hong-Jun Jang"],"meta":["July 2018Soft Computing 22(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-017-2772-7"],"references":["279036074_Unsupervised_Short_Answer_Grading_Using_Spreading_Activation_over_an_Associative_Network_of_Concepts","228930688_Evaluation_of_thesaurus_on_sociopolitical_life_as_information_retrieval_tool","221995679_Gini_Support_Vector_Machine_Quadratic_Entropy_Based_Robust_Multi-Class_Probability_Regression","289226177_Automatic_scoring_system_based_on_Korean_lexico-_semantic_pattern","288122159_KASS_Korean_automatic_scoring_system_for_short-answer_questions","270597486_The_Eras_and_Trends_of_Automatic_Short_Answer_Grading","254116482_A_Computer-Based_Approach_for_Deriving_and_Measuring_Individual_and_Team_Knowledge_Structure_from_Essay_Questions","245569547_An_Intelligent_Marking_System_based_on_Semantic_Kernel_and_Korean_WordNet","220817144_Lexico-Semantic_Pattern_Matching_as_a_Companion_to_Parsing_in_Text_Understanding","28576188_CAA_of_short_non-MCQ_answers","26388622_An_Overview_of_Current_Research_on_Automated_Essay_Grading","2659578_Conceptual_Indexing_Using_Thematic_Representation_of_Texts","2861070_Automated_Essay_Scoring_for_Nonnative_English_Speakers"]}
