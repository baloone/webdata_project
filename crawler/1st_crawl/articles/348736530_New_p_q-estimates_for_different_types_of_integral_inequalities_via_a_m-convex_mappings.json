{"id":"348736530_New_p_q-estimates_for_different_types_of_integral_inequalities_via_a_m-convex_mappings","abstract":"In the article, we present a new ( p , q ) -integral identity for the first-order ( p , q ) -differentiable functions and establish several new ( p , q ) -quantum error estimations for various integral inequalities via ( Î± , m ) -convexity. We also compare our results with the previously known results and provide two examples to show the superiority of our obtained results.","authors":["Humaira Kalsoom","Muhammad Amer Latif","Saima Rashid","Dumitru Baleanu"],"meta":["December 2020Open Mathematics 18(1):1830-1854","DOI:10.1515/math-2020-0114"],"references":["345349487_Sharp_Power_Mean_Inequalities_for_the_Generalized_Elliptic_Integral_of_the_First_Kind","343855026_On_some_fractional_integral_inequalities_for_generalized_strongly_modified_H-convex_functions","343844889_Bounds_for_the_Remainder_in_Simpson's_Inequality_via_-Polynomial_Convex_Functions_of_Higher_Order_Using_Katugampola_Fractional_Integrals","343739273_On_some_refinements_for_inequalities_involving_zero-balanced_hypergeometric_function","343692041_A_variant_of_Jensen-type_inequality_and_related_results_for_harmonic_convex_functions","343667234_Estimates_of_quantum_bounds_pertaining_to_new_q-integral_identity_with_applications","343654446_Some_Trapezium-Like_Inequalities_Involving_Functions_Having_Strongly_-Polynomial_Preinvexity_Property_of_Higher_Order","343515523_Fractional_Hadamard_and_Fejer-Hadamard_Inequalities_Associated_with_Exponentially_s_m_-Convex_Functions","343509217_Fractional_generalized_Hadamard_and_Fejer-Hadamard_inequalities_for_m-convex_functions","343449070_Some_new_local_fractional_inequalities_associated_with_generalized_s_m-convex_functions_and_applications"]}
