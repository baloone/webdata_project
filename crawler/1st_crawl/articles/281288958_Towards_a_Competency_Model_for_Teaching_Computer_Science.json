{"id":"281288958_Towards_a_Competency_Model_for_Teaching_Computer_Science","abstract":"To address the special challenges of teaching computer science, adequate development of teachers’\ncompetencies during their education is extremely important. In particular, pedagogical content\nknowledge and teachers’ beliefs and motivational orientations play an important role in effective\nteaching. This research field has been sparsely investigated up to now and there exists no consistent\ncompetency model for teaching computer science in Germany. Therefore, this paper describes the\ndevelopment of competency in the areas of pedagogical content knowledge, teachers’ beliefs, and\nmotivational orientations with regard to computer science. Competency-relevant factors for teaching\ncomputer science are theoretically derived and concretely formulated with the help of expert\ninterviews conducted according to the critical incident technique and analyzed using techniques of\nqualitative content analysis.","authors":["Elena Bender","Peter Hubwieser","Niclas Schaper","Melanie Margaritis"],"meta":["August 2015Peabody Journal of Education 90(4):519-532","DOI:10.1080/0161956X.2015.1068082"],"references":["299805760_Professional_Competence_of_Teachers_Cognitively_Activating_Instruction_and_the_Development_of_Students'_Mathematical_Literacy_COACTIV_A_Research_Program","281727467_Berufsbezogene_Uberzeugungen_von_Lehrerinnen_und_Lehrern","281345632_Aufgabenfelder_und_Perspektiven_bei_der_Kompetenzmodellierung_und_-messung_in_der_Lehrerbildung","278715098_Publications_from_the_COACTIV_research_program_January_2013","272415019_Identifying_and_formulating_teachers'_beliefs_and_motivational_orientations_for_computer_science_teacher_education","266032432_Cognitive_Activation_in_the_Mathematics_Classroom_and_Professional_Competence_of_Teachers_Results_from_the_COACTIV_Project","316858624_Computer_Science_Curricula_2013_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Computer_Science","315504133_Didaktik_der_Informatik","276190504_The_Critical_Incident_Technique","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","264626324_Perspectives_and_Visions_of_Computer_Science_Education_in_Primary_and_Secondary_K-12_Schools","262198358_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_for_Computer_Science_in_German_Teacher_Education_Curricula","257633112_Implementation_of_Computer_Science_in_Context_-_a_research_perspective_regarding_teacher-training","257583694_Mathematics_teachers'_learning_A_conceptual_framework_and_synthesis_of_research","255647628_Content_Knowledge_for_Teaching_What_Makes_It_Special"]}
