{"id":"261384840_Active_binaural_localization_of_intermittent_moving_sources_in_the_presence_of_false_measurements","abstract":"This paper takes place within the field of active sound source localization in a binaural context. A stochastic filtering strategy is presented for the localization of a still or moving source from a moving binaural sensor. The proposed method accounts for the source intermittence as well as for false measurements induced by the non-stationarity of the emitted signal. Its effectiveness is showed on experimental results.","authors":["Alban Portello","Patrick Danes","Sylvain Argentieri"],"meta":["October 2012Proceedings of the ...
