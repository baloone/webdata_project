{"id":"325662035_A_METHOD_FOR_FORECASTING_WEATHER_CONDITION_BY_USING_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_ALGORITHM","abstract":"This article presents a method to forecast and make decision on weather condition. In most of the cities around the world, people try to decide on leisure activities on their spare time but weather condition would not be suitable for them. By this fact, we suggest a solution to solve this problem with ANN. Therefore, users of our proposed method can organize their daily life in accordance with weather condition. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is one of the popular research subjects in computer science, thus, this paper aims to familiarize the reader with ANN. In our proposed method, at first, people can organize weather condition, and then the program suggest whether the time is suitable for them or not on chosen hour of day. In ANN, we discuss about neuron that have relation with performance. Mean Square Error (MSE) is the key issue for the performance of our method. At the end, the simulation results show that relation between Neuron and MSE is applicable for daily usage.","authors":["Amir Seyyedabbasi","Fuat Candan","Farzad Kiani"],"meta":["April 2018ICTACT Journal on Soft Computing 8(3)","DOI:10.21917/ijsc.2018.0237"],"references":["266577766_Artificial_Neural_Networks_in_Control_and_Optimization","260739937_A_rainfall_prediction_model_using_artificial_neural_network","306175379_Advantages_and_disadvantages_of_using_neural_networks_for_predictions","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","267438295_Artificial_Neural_Networks","260468108_Economic_Value_of_Weather_and_Climate_Forecasts","239574281_Boltzmann_machines_Constraint_satisfaction_networks_that_learn","238432280_A_Sociological_Study_of_the_Official_History_of_the_Perceptrons_Controversy","233822447_Learning_Internal_Representation_by_Back-Propagation_Errors","223934944_Competitive_Learning_From_Interactive_Activation_to_Adaptive_Resonance"]}
