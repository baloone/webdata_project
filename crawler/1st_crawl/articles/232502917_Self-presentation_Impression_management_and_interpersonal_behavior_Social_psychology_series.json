{"id":"232502917_Self-presentation_Impression_management_and_interpersonal_behavior_Social_psychology_series","abstract":"This book is about the ways in which human behavior is affected by people's concerns with their public impressions. \n\nOne theme of this book is that, far from being a sign of insecurity, vanity, or shallowness, a certain degree of concern for one's public impressions is essential for smooth and successful social interaction. \n\nThis book is organized around 4 general issues or themes regarding the functions, causes, and effects of self-presentation in everyday life. The first 2 chapters provide us with a background for understanding self-presentation, with an emphasis on the tactics people use to manage their impressions. \n\nThe 2nd issue we will address involves the question of why people are motivated to manage their impressions. \n\nThe last portion of the book . . . examines the myriad of factors that affect the kinds of impressions people try to convey in a particular situation. \n\nFinally, the book concludes with a look at what happens, both behaviorally and emotionally, when people think they are making undesired impressions on other people.
