{"id":"221394090_Query_Learning_and_Certificates_in_Lattices","abstract":"We provide an abstract version, in terms of lattices, of the Horn query learning algorithm of D. Angluin, M. Frazier, and L. Pitt [“Learning conjunctions of Horn clauses”, Mach. Learn. 9, No. 2–3, 147–164 (1992; Zbl 0766.68107)]. To validate it, we develop a proof that is independent of the propositional Horn logic structure. We also construct a certificate set for the class of lattices that generalizes and improves an earlier certificate construction and that relates very clearly with the new proof.","authors":["Marta Arias","José L.
