{"id":"235920362_Distribution_discontinuities_detection_using_algebraic_technique_for_spectrum_sensing_in_cognitive_radio","abstract":"In this paper1, we propose a new Spectrum Sensing technique for spectrum distribution discontinuities detection using algebraic detection (AD). The presented mathematical background leading to such technique is based on operational calculus and differential algebra which offers a new stand point in sensing theory. Even if this background is quite heavy, the sensing algorithm related to this technique is nevertheless very simple and remains with extremely low complexity, comparable even to the Energy Detection technique (ED). Simulations results show good performance of the proposed technique in terms of reliability and accuracy with low complexity and good robustness in noisy context.","authors":["Wael Guibene","Aawatif Hayar","Turki Hadj Alouane Monia"],"meta":["June 2010","DOI:10.4108/ICST.CROWNCOM2010.9183","Conference: Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks & Communications (CROWNCOM), 2010 Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on"],"references":["224574908_Blind_Spectrum_Sensing_for_Cognitive_Radio_Based_on_Signal_Space_Dimension_Estimation","221461025_Spike_Detection_and_Sorting_Combining_Algebraic_Differentiations_with_ICA","4344932_Blind_Spectrum_Sensing_for_Cognitive_Radio_Based_on_Model_Selection","306202620_Cognitive_radio_An_integrated_agent_architecture_for_software_defined_radio_Doctor_of_Technology","224705910_A_Wavelet_Approach_to_Wideband_Spectrum_Sensing_for_Cognitive_Radios","4344683_Cognitive_Radio_Sensing_Information-Theoretic_Criteria_Based","2991034_Energy_Detection_of_Unknown_Deterministic_Signals","2990073_Energy_Detection_of_Unknown_Deterministic_Signals","2564682_An_Integrated_Agent_Architecture_for_Software_Defined_Radio"]}
