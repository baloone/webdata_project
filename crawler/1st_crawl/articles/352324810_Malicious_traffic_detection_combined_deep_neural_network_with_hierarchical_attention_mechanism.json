{"id":"352324810_Malicious_traffic_detection_combined_deep_neural_network_with_hierarchical_attention_mechanism","abstract":"Given the gradual intensification of the current network security situation, malicious attack traffic is flooding the entire network environment, and the current malicious traffic detection model is insufficient in detection efficiency and detection performance. This paper proposes a data processing method that divides the flow data into data flow segments so that the model can improve the throughput per unit time to meet its detection efficiency. For this kind of data, a malicious traffic detection model with a hierarchical attention mechanism is also proposed and named HAGRU (Hierarchical Attention Gated Recurrent Unit). By fusing the feature information of the three hierarchies, the detection ability of the model is improved. An attention mechanism is introduced to focus on malicious flows in the data flow segment, which can reasonably utilize limited computing resources. Finally, compare the proposed model with the current state of the method on the datasets. The experimental results show that: the novel model performs well in different evaluation indicators (detection rate, false-positive rate, F -score), and it can improve the performance of category recognition with fewer samples when the data is unbalanced. At the same time, the training of the novel model on larger datasets will enhance the generalization ability and reduce the false alarm rate. The proposed model not only improves the performance of malicious traffic detection but also provides a new research method for improving the efficiency of model detection.","authors":["Xiaoyang Liu","Jiamiao Liu"],"meta":["June 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-91805-z"],"references":["348849888_Anomaly_Detection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network_using_Inverse_Weight_Clustering_and_C50_Decision_Tree","347852428_Deep_Learning_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory_for_IoT_Traffic_Prediction","342662119_Ensemble_Feature_Selection_and_Classification_of_Internet_Traffic_using_XGBoost_Classifier","332211679_A_Novel_Hierarchical_Intrusion_Detection_System_Based_on_Decision_Tree_and_Rules-Based_Models","344988850_III3_Theory_of_the_Backpropagation_Neural_Network","343207868_SwiftIDS_Real-time_Intrusion_Detection_System_Based_on_LightGBM_and_Parallel_Intrusion_Detection_Mechanism","342432311_A_Reinforcement_Learning-Based_Network_Traffic_Prediction_Mechanism_in_Intelligent_Internet_of_Things","338326261_A_Survey_on_Intrusion_Detection_System_for_Software_Defined_Networks_SDN","338212098_Robust_Detection_for_Network_Intrusion_of_Industrial_IoT_Based_on_Multi-CNN_Fusion","335652791_A_machine_learning_based_framework_for_IoT_device_identification_and_abnormal_traffic_detection","332134522_Deep-Full-Range_A_Deep_Learning_Based_Network_Encrypted_Traffic_Classification_and_Intrusion_Detection_Framework","331129478_Host_Based_Intrusion_Detection_System_with_Combined_CNNRNN_Model","330632470_Deep_Learning_in_Intrusion_Detection_Systems","328840339_Analysis_of_Lightweight_Feature_Vectors_for_Attack_Detection_in_Network_Traffic","327861880_Host_based_Intrusion_Detection_System_with_Combined_CNNRNN_Model"]}
