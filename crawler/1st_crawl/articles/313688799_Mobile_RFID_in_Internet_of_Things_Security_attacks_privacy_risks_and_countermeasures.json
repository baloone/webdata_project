{"id":"313688799_Mobile_RFID_in_Internet_of_Things_Security_attacks_privacy_risks_and_countermeasures","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoTs) is an emerging technological paradigm that entails interconnected smart objects in order to sense, communicate and interact autonomously, finally providing advanced services. This innovative phenomenon makes the smart objects capable of seeing, hearing, thinking and performing jobs by sharing information and coordinating decisions. The potential growth of IoTs is highly dependent upon enabling technologies like RFID technology, Sensor technology, smart technologies and nanotechnology. RFID is the first communication technology that apprehends the concept of M2M, enabling the machines to identify objects, understanding their status, communicating information and taking necessary actions. In this paper we highlight important security and privacy risks/issues, challenges and countermeasures involved in the mobile RFID when it is used in IoTs. The risk mitigation is also pointed out for the attacks and problems involved.","authors":["Wazir Zada Khan","Hussein Zangoti","Mohammed Y Aalsalem","Muhammad Zahid"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICRAMET.2016.7849578","Conference: 2016 International Conference on Radar, Antenna, Microwave, Electronics, and Telecommunications (ICRAMET)"],"references":["283487760_An_automated_vehicle_parking_monitoring_and_management_system_using_ANPR_cameras","279177017_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey_on_Enabling_Technologies_Protocols_and_Applications","277084625_Distributed_Clone_Detection_in_Static_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Random_Walk_with_Network_Division","261311447_Future_Internet_The_Internet_of_Things_Architecture_Possible_Applications_and_Key_Challenges","261024274_Challenges_in_middleware_solutions_for_the_internet_of_things","254032690_RFID_technology_and_its_applications_in_Internet_of_Things_IoT","239764907_RFID_as_an_Enabler_of_the_Internet_of_Things_Issues_of_Security_and_Privacy","228799604_System_framework_and_its_application_in_mobile_RFID_Service_network","224250332_The_Evolution_of_RFID_Security_and_Privacy_A_Research_Survey","224175757_Research_on_the_architecture_of_Internet_of_Things","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","221632082_RFID_Privacy_Models_Revisited","220962860_Modeling_Privacy_for_Off-Line_RFID_Systems","220144384_A_Survey_on_Facilities_for_Experimental_Internet_of_Things_Research","50296658_Privacy_Analysis_of_Forward_and_Backward_Untraceable_RFID_Authentication_Schemes","311681490_CampusSense-A_Smart_Vehicle_Parking_Monitoring_and_management_System_using_ANPR_cameras_and_android_phones","269301978_Detecting_replicated_nodes_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_using_random_walks_and_network_division","269272519_Designing_IoT_architectures_A_European_perspective","268690745_A_potential_weakness_in_RFID-based_Internet-of-things_systems","266647384_A_Survey_of_the_Internet_of_Things","261469784_OTrack_Order_tracking_for_luggage_in_mobile_RFID_systems","261307217_RFID_Technology_and_Network_Construction_in_the_Internet_of_Things","261233674_A_security_and_privacy_model_for_mobile_RFID_systems_in_the_internet_of_things","261197100_Survey_of_Internet_of_Things_Technologies_for_Clinical_Environments","261045191_A_survey_on_the_ietf_protocol_suite_for_the_internet_of_things_Standards_challenges_and_opportunities","260670866_Mobile_Phone_Sensing_Systems_A_Survey","252034675_Study_and_application_on_the_architecture_and_key_technologies_for_IOT","238676729_IPv6_over_Low-Power_Wireless_Personal_Area_Networks_6LoWPANs_Overview_Assumptions_Problem_Statement_and_Goals","232621150_Smart_Home_Mobile_RFID-Based_Internet-of-Things_Systems_and_Services","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","224178135_Ubiquitous_ID_Standards_for_Ubiquitous_Computing_and_the_Internet_of_Things","224175759_Future_internet_The_Internet_of_Things","220967702_Building_the_Internet_of_Things_Using_a_Mobile_RFID_Security_Protocol_Based_on_Information_Technology","37460744_Mutual_Authentication_in_RFID_Security_and_Privacy","37454208_On_privacy_models_for_RFID","31773703_RFID_Handbook_Fundamentals_and_Applications_in_Contactless_Smart_Cards_and_Identification_K_Finkenzeller","4264720_Secure_Mobile_RFID_system_against_privacy_and_security_problems"]}
