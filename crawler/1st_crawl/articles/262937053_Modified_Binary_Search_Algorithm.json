{"id":"262937053_Modified_Binary_Search_Algorithm","abstract":"This paper proposes a modification to the traditional binary search algorithm\nin which it checks the presence of the input element with the middle element of\nthe given set of elements at each iteration. Modified binary search algorithm\noptimizes the worst case of the binary search algorithm by comparing the input\nelement with the first & last element of the data set along with the middle\nelement and also checks the input number belongs to the range of numbers\npresent in the given data set at each iteration there by reducing the time\ntaken by the worst cases of binary search algorithm.","authors":["Ankit R Chadha","Rishikesh Misal","Tanaya Mokashi"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.5120/ijais14-451131","SourcearXiv"],"references":["216457274_The_Art_Of_Computer_Programming_Vol3_Sorting_and_Searching","36966582_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_-_Vol_3_Sorting_and_Searching"]}
