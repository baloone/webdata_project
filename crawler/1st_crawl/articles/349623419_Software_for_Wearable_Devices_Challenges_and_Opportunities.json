{"id":"349623419_Software_for_Wearable_Devices_Challenges_and_Opportunities","abstract":"Wearable devices are a new style of portable computer system that provides unique and user-personalized services. Wearable devices reflect new challenges and issues to computer science and technology. This paper summarizes the current siuation, development process and important software research issues of wearable devices. The technology of wearable devices is under-mature. The development of wearable devices is thus bound to face various problems such as incompatibility between operating system and software, comfort of human-computer interaction, data transmission, secrecy of the information, energy-consumption problems brought watch. by regular and uniform running.","authors":["Lalita Peersingh Purohit","Dr Kalpana","Habeebullah Hussaini Syed"],"meta":["February 2018SSRN Electronic Journal 6(1):455-461"],"references":["354192967_Significance_of_developing_Multiple_Big_Data_Analytics_Platforms_with_Rapid_Response","350006212_FUTURE_OF_ROBOTS_AI_AND_AUTOMATION_IN_THE_UNITED_STATES","349641584_DATA_MODELS_IN_INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY","221560176_Software_engineering_issues_for_mobile_application_development","45630640_Security_and_Privacy_Issues_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Healthcare_Applications","264833773_What_Does_Big_Data_Mean_for_Wearable_Sensor_Systems_Contribution_of_the_IMIA_Wearable_Sensors_in_Healthcare_WG","262177046_Calculating_source_line_level_energy_information_for_Android_applications","261416902_Reducing_the_Energy_Consumption_of_Mobile_Applications_Behind_the_Scenes","261039136_Estimating_mobile_application_energy_consumption_using_program_analysis","221097005_Innovative_User_Interfaces_for_Wearable_Computers_in_Real_Augmented_Environment","2985449_Humanistic_computing_WearComp_as_a_new_framework_and_application_for_intelligent_signal_processing"]}
