{"id":"334100809_A_new_type_of_fuzzy_semiprime_subsets_in_ordered_semigroups","abstract":"The concept of an (∨ (k∗, qk))-fuzzy semiprime subset in an ordered semigroup is introduced, and investigate the properties of ( , ∨ (k∗, qk))-fuzzy generalized bi-ideals by concerning the ( , ∨ (k∗, qk))-fuzzy semiprime subsets. Moreover, some properties of ( , ∨ (k∗, qk))-fuzzy semiprime subsets are defined in terms of its (k∗, k)-lower part. Finally, completely regular ordered semigroups are characterized in terms of its ( , ∨ (k∗, qk))-fuzzy semiprime generalized bi-ideals and their (k∗, k)-lower parts.","authors":["G.
