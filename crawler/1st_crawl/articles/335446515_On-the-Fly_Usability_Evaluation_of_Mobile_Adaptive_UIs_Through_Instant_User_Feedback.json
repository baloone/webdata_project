{"id":"335446515_On-the-Fly_Usability_Evaluation_of_Mobile_Adaptive_UIs_Through_Instant_User_Feedback","abstract":"Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) have been promoted as a solution for context variability due to their ability to automatically adapt to the context-of-use at runtime. For the acceptance of AUIs, usability plays a crucial role. Classical usability evaluation methods like usability tests, interviews or cognitive walkthroughs are not sufficient for evaluating end-user satisfaction of AUIs at runtime. The main reason is that the UI and context-of-use are dynamically changing and acceptance of UI adaptation features has to be evaluated in the moment and context-of-use when the adaptations occur. To address this challenge, we present an on-the-fly usability evaluation solution that combines continuous context monitoring together with collection of instant user feedback to assess end-user satisfaction of UI adaptation features. We demonstrate the usefulness and benefit of our solution based on a mobile Android mail app, which served as basis for conducting a usability study.","authors":["Enes Yigitbas","Ivan Jovanovikj","Klementina Josifovska","Stefan Sauer"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-29390-1_38","In book: Human-Computer Interaction â€“ INTERACT 2019 (pp.563-567)"],"references":["318173473_Self-adaptive_UIs_Integrated_Model-Driven_Development_of_UIs_and_Their_Adaptations","220781078_A_Unifying_Reference_Framework_for_the_Development_of_Plastic_User_Interfaces","220254312_User-centered_evaluation_of_adaptive_and_adaptable_systems_A_literature_review","226237449_Natural_Human-Computer_Interaction"]}
