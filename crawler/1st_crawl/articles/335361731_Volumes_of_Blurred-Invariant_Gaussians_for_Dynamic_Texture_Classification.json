{"id":"335361731_Volumes_of_Blurred-Invariant_Gaussians_for_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","abstract":"An effective model, which jointly captures shape and motion cues, for dynamic texture (DT) description is introduced by taking into account advantages of volumes of blurred-invariant features in three main following stages. First, a 3-dimensional Gaussian kernel is used to form smoothed sequences that allow to deal with well-known limitations of local encoding such as near uniform regions and sensitivity to noise. Second, a receptive volume of the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) is figured out to mitigate the negative impacts of environmental and illumination changes which are major challenges in DT understanding. Finally, a local encoding operator is addressed to construct a discriminative descriptor of enhancing patterns extracted from the filtered volumes. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (i.e., UCLA, DynTex, and DynTex++) for issue of DT classification have positively validated our crucial contributions.","authors":["Thanh Tuan Nguyen","Phuong Thanh Nguyen","Frédéric Bouchara","Son Vu"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-29888-3_13","In book: Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns, 18th International Conference, CAIP 2019, Salerno, Italy, September 3–5, 2019, Proceedings, Part I (pp.155-167)"],"references":["328171919_Directional_Beams_of_Dense_Trajectories_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","327655731_Completed_Local_Structure_Patterns_on_Three_Orthogonal_Planes_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","315116628_Convolutional_Neural_Network_on_Three_Orthogonal_Planes_for_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","304357317_Topological_Attribute_Patterns_for_Texture_Recognition","295173717_Improved_Weber's_law_based_local_binary_pattern_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","263813576_Optimizing_LBP_Structure_For_Visual_Recognition_Using_Binary_Quadratic_Programming","257732023_Characterization_and_Recognition_of_Dynamic_Textures_based_on_2DT_Curvelet_Transform","222614245_DynTex_A_comprehensive_database_of_dynamic_textures","221304045_Maximum_Margin_Distance_Learning_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","220320803_LIBLINEAR_a_library_for_large_linear_classification","4260067_Classifying_Video_with_Kernel_Dynamic_Textures","3940791_Dynamic_texture_recognition","335538866_Smooth-Invariant_Gaussian_Features_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","328402305_Completed_statistical_adaptive_patterns_on_three_orthogonal_planes_for_recognition_of_dynamic_textures_and_scenes","323712753_Completed_local_structure_patterns_on_three_orthogonal_planes_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","320544059_Spatiotemporal_Lacunarity_Spectrum_for_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","319605650_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Volume_Local_Binary_Count_Patterns_With_an_Application_to_2D_Face_Spoofing_Detection","313761247_Recognizing_Dynamic_Scenes_with_Deep_Dual_Descriptor_based_on_Key_Frames_and_Key_Segments","313527206_A_completed_modeling_of_local_binary_pattern_operator_for_texture_classification","311978037_Dynamic_Texture_Representation_Using_a_Deep_Multi-Scale_Convolutional_Network","311611053_Equiangular_Kernel_Dictionary_Learning_with_Applications_to_Dynamic_Texture_Analysis","310735568_Dynamic_texture_recognition_using_multiresolution_edge-weighted_local_structure_pattern","301761593_A_novel_scheme_based_on_local_binary_pattern_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","300412827_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_via_Orthogonal_Tensor_Dictionary_Learning","282409762_Statistical_binary_patterns_for_rotational_invariant_texture_classification","276164399_Classifying_Dynamic_Textures_via_Spatiotemporal_Fractal_Analysis","273529088_Chaotic_features_for_dynamic_textures_recognition","273528138_Dynamic_texture_recognition_based_on_completed_volume_local_binary_pattern","273395769_Discriminative_Non-Linear_Stationary_Subspace_Analysis_for_Video_Classification","273393002_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Multiscale_Binarized_Statistical_Image_Features","273308875_Spatiotemporal_Directional_Number_Transitional_Graph_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","271771514_Dynamic_texture_and_scene_classification_by_transferring_deep_image_features","261314603_Dynamic_texture_recognition_using_enhanced_LBP_features","259044298_Improving_Texture_Categorization_with_Biologically_Inspired_Filtering","257484783_Scale-space_texture_description_on_SIFT-like_textons","230713633_Wavelet_Domain_Multifractal_Analysis_for_Static_and_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","227343637_Completed_Local_Binary_Count_for_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification","221361369_View-Invariant_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_using_a_Bag_of_Dynamical_Systems","220809577_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","6397809_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Local_Binary_Patterns_with_an_Application_to_Facial_Expressions","5602029_Synergizing_spatial_and_temporal_texture","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns"]}
