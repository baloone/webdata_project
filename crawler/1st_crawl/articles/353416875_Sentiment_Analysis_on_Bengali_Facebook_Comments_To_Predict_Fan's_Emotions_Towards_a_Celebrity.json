{"id":"353416875_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Bengali_Facebook_Comments_To_Predict_Fan's_Emotions_Towards_a_Celebrity","abstract":"In this present era, sentiment analysis is considered as one of the most rapidly growing fields of computer science study. It is a text mining technique which is automated and determines the emotion of a text. A text can be divided into many emotions using sentiment analysis. Since there are some studies on emotion analysis in the Bangla language, it is regarded as a key research area in the field of analyzing Bangla language. This paper works with five different emotions and those are Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise and Excited. Apart from these emotions our paper also deals with two categories, such as Abusive and Religious. We proposed a method of machine learning technique which is the SVM algorithm to extract these five individual emotions from Bangla text.","authors":["Md.
