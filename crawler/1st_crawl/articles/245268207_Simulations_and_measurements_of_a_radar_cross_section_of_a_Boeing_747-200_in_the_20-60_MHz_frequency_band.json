At these frequencies, Radar Cross Section (RCS) behavior is not well known because the scattered field is due to a complex phenomenon where the interactions between the different parts of the structure have a significant contribution, which makes the prediction difficult. A wire model of a commercial Boeing 747-200 aircraft, developed to be used with the Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC), is presented. The reliability of this model has been assessed by comparing the results given by NEC with the measurements made in an anecho√Øc chamber with a scaled aircraft, and a relatively good agreement was observed between simulations and measurements. The RCS variations of an aircraft along different flight routes have been investigated, and it is shown that it is necessary to know the flight route of the airplane to envisage target identification in spite of the use of the low frequency band.","authors":["Arnaud David","Christian Brousseau","A.
