{"id":"263567391_Mobile_Learning_and_BYOD_Implementations_in_an_Intensive_English_Program","abstract":"Mobile devices are empowering tools and mobile learning has instigated a paradigm shift in education where the roles of educators and learners are being redefined. Within mobile learning, the ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD) movement is currently increasing. Educators no longer need to depend on their institution to provide them with technology, nor on IT technicians for IT related support. This paper discusses how BYOD can be implemented to facilitate a move towards mobile learning. I present examples of practical classroom applications from classes at the University of Sharjah, as well as how these are currently integrated into lesson plans, class projects, presentations and assessment.","authors":["Rasha Alokaily"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.18538/lthe.v10.n2.141"],"references":["343083598_mLearning_Mobile_Wireless_In-Your-_Pocket_Learning","220374785_Defining_Mobile_Learning_in_the_Higher_Education_Landscape","220141546_The_Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Mobile_Learning_Resource","26468172_Defining_Discussing_and_Evaluating_Mobile_Learning_The_moving_finger_writes_and_having_writ","4066320_Context_awareness_and_adaptation_in_mobile_learning","309476418_The_moving_finger_writes_and_having_writInternational_Review_of_Research_in_Open_and_Distance_Learning","234589891_Going_Nomadic_Mobile_Learning_in_Higher_Education"]}
