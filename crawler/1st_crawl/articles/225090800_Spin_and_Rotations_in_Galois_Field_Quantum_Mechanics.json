{"id":"225090800_Spin_and_Rotations_in_Galois_Field_Quantum_Mechanics","abstract":"We discuss the properties of Galois Field Quantum Mechanics constructed on a\nvector space over the finite Galois field GF(q). In particular, we look at\n2-level systems analogous to spin, and discuss how SO(3) rotations could be\nembodied in such a system. We also consider two-particle `spin' correlations\nand show that the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is nonetheless\nnot violated in this model.","authors":["Lay Chang","Zachary Lewis","Djordje Minic","Tatsu Takeuchi"],"meta":["May 2012Journal of Physics A Mathematical and Theoretical 46(6)","DOI:10.1088/1751-8113/46/6/065304","SourcearXiv"],"references":["253153674_An_Introduction_to_Finite_Geometry","236347053_Effects_of_symmetry_breaking_in_finite_quantum_systems","234143665_Shape_transitions_in_excited_states_of_two-electron_quantum_dots_in_a_magnetic_field","265374085_Projective_Geometries_Over_Finite_Fields","265033988_Dynamics_Statistics_and_Projective_Geometry_of_Galois_Fields","253523503_Bell's_theorem_without_inequalities","238995887_1_Q_expansion_for_the_energy_spectrum_of_quantum_dots","235593906_Quantum_states_of_interacting_electrons_in_a_real_quantum_dot","234941357_Two_interacting_electrons_in_a_uniform_magnetic_field_and_a_parabolic_potential_The_general_closed-form_solution","231050029_Quantum_systems_with_finite_Hilbert_space_Galois_fields_in_quantum_mechanics"]}
