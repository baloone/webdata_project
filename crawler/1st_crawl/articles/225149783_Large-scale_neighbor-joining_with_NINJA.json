{"id":"225149783_Large-scale_neighbor-joining_with_NINJA","abstract":"Neighbor-joining is a well-established hierarchical clustering algorithm for inferring phylogenies. It begins with observed\ndistances between pairs of sequences, and clustering order depends on a metric related to those distances. The canonical algorithm\nrequires O(n\n3) time and O(n\n2) space for n sequences, which precludes application to very large sequence families, e.g. those containing 100,000 sequences. Datasets\nof this size are available today, and such phylogenies will play an increasingly important role in comparative biology studies.\nRecent algorithmic advances have greatly sped up neighbor-joining for inputs of thousands of sequences, but are limited to\nfewer than 13,000 sequences on a system with 4GB RAM. In this paper, I describe an algorithm that speeds up neighbor-joining\nby dramatically reducing the number of distance values that are viewed in each iteration of the clustering procedure, while\nstill computing a correct neighbor-joining tree. This algorithm can scale to inputs larger than 100,000 sequences because\nof external-memory-efficient data structures.
