{"id":"319770198_Learning_a_Deep_Convolutional_Network_for_Image_Super-Resolution","abstract":"We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers.","authors":["Chao Dong","Chen Change Loy","Kaiming He","Xiaoou Tang"],"meta":["January 2014","Conference: ECCV"],"references":[]}
