{"id":"221571226_Video_Parsing_Retrieval_and_Browsing_An_Integrated_and_Content-Based_Solution","abstract":"This paper presents an integrated solution for computer assisted video parsing and content-based video retrieval and browsing. The uniqueness and effectiveness of this solution lies in its use of video content information provided by a parsing process driven by visual feature analysis. More specifically, parsing will temporally segment and abstract a video source, based on low-level image analyses; then retrieval and browsing of video will be based on key-frames selected during abstraction and spatial-temporal variations of visual features, as well as some shot-level semantics derived from camera operation and motion analysis. These processes, as well as video retrieval and browsing tools, are presented in detail as functions of an integrated system. Also, experimental results on automatic key-frame detection are given.","authors":["HongJiang Zhang","Chien Yong Low","Stephen W.
