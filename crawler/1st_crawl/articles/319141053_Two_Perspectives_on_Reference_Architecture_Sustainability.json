{"id":"319141053_Two_Perspectives_on_Reference_Architecture_Sustainability","abstract":"In the context of software architectures, sustainability has been\ninvestigated as an important quality property to assess how well\nthese architectures support changes over time. Several initiatives\nto achieve sustainable software architectures/systems can be already\nfound. In parallel, reference architectures have served as an\ne ective support to facilitate and standardize the development and\nevolution of software systems, including in complex, critical application\ndomains. By encompassing valuable knowledge of speci�c\ndomains, the reference architectures survival is considered of utmost\nimportance, however, the most of such architectures have not\nbeen updated since their �rst version. Furthermore, there is a lack\nof works investigating how a reference architectures, by itself, can\nbecome sustainable and/or can contribute to develop sustainable\nsystems in a domain. The main contribution of this paper is to\nprovide a �rst view about sustainability on reference architectures.\nResulting from our expertise on reference architectures, we bring\nout the two perspectives on their sustainability: (i) sustainability\nIN reference architectures; and (ii) sustainability OF reference architectures.\nIn particular, for the perspective OF, we analyzed 20\nexisting reference architectures to assess their sustainability, and\nwe found most of them were not updated over time. Hence, we also\nprovide an initial set of aspects that could contribute to address\nsustainability of those architectures.","authors":["Tiago Volpato","Brauner Oliveira","Lina Garcés","Rafael Capilla"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1145/3129790.3129815","Conference: 3rd Workshop on Sustainable Architecture: Global Collaboration, Requirements, Analysis (SAGRA 2017) @ 11th Europen Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA)At: Canterbury, United Kingdom","Project: Reference Architectures: Factors for their Sustainability"],"references":["299493620_Reference_Architecture_and_Product_Line_Architecture_A_Subtle_But_Critical_Difference","291436689_Diversifying_Software_Architecture_for_Sustainability_A_Value-based_Perspective","288855901_Reference_Architectures_for_the_Internet_of_Things","282325166_Framing_Sustainability_as_a_Property_of_Software_Quality","280839981_Guidelines_and_Metrics_for_Configurable_and_Sustainable_Architectural_Knowledge_Modelling","277285571_K_Definition_of_Reference_Architecture_Based_on_Existing_Architectures","273004134_Cloud_Computing_Features_Issues_and_Challenges_A_Big_Picture","269303736_Consolidating_a_Process_for_the_Design_Representation_and_Evaluation_of_Reference_Architectures","266658756_Systematic_mapping_Study_on_Software_Engineering_for_Sustainability_SE4S","262144337_Reference_Architecture_Foundation_for_Service_Oriented_Architecture_Version_10","261356672_RAModel_A_Reference_Model_for_Reference_Architectures","261045230_Architecture_Sustainability_Guest_editors'_introduction","260675436_REARM_A_Reuse-Based_Economic_Model_for_Software_Reference_Architectures","259470965_Sustainable_Architectural_Design_Decisions","228981816_Reference_architecture_foundation_for_service_oriented_architecture_version_10","228403638_Reference_model_for_service_oriented_architecture_10","224624996_Technology_harmonization_-_Developing_a_reference_architecture_for_the_ground_segment_software","224130871_Human_exploration_of_Mars_Design_Reference_Architecture_50","224001127_Software_Architecture_In_Practice","221146401_Empirically-grounded_reference_architectures","220864804_A_Classification_of_Software_Reference_Architectures_Analyzing_Their_Success_and_Effectiveness","220826611_A_Reference_Architecture_for_Self-organizing_Service-Oriented_Computing","220757105_Reference_Models_and_Reference_Architectures_Based_on_Service-Oriented_Architecture_A_Systematic_Review","309900872_Sustainability_guidelines_for_long-living_software_systems","309638883_Diversifying_Software_Architecture_for_Sustainability_A_Value-Based_Perspective","283213764_Building_Sustainable_Software_by_Preemptive_Architectural_Design_Using_Tactic-Equipped_Patterns","274705844_Four-Dimensional_Sustainable_E-Services","273692840_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Reference_Architectures_for_Healthcare_in_the_Ambient_Assisted_Living_Domain","262252269_Architectural_Styles_for_Distributed_Interoperability","261155368_Runtime_Monitoring_of_SOA_Applications_Importance_Implementations_and_Challenges","260720748_Measuring_Architecture_Sustainability","254858985_Quality_of_software_reference_architectures","254040633_Identifying_the_need_for_a_sustainable_architecture_maintenance_process","252020516_An_Architectural_Style_for_Liquid_Web_Services","251884541_Defining_reference_architecture_for_NTIS_development","249644373_Right_Sizing_Reference_Architectures_How_to_provide_specific_guidance_with_limited_information","235721873_Sustainability_Guidelines_for_Long-Living_Software_Systems","234218596_Architectural_Knowledge_in_an_SOA_Infrastructure_Reference_Architecture","224595578_Toward_a_flexible_service-oriented_reference_architecture_for_situational_awareness_systems_in_distributed_disaster_knowledge_management","224374634_Dynamic_Web_Service_Based_Image_Processing_System","224324406_A_Solution_Model_for_Service-Oriented_Architecture","224317077_A_Service-oriented_Approach_to_Integration_of_e-learning_Information_and_Resource_Management_Systems","224260085_Toward_sustainable_software_engineering_NIER_track","224101525_The_IBM_telecommunications_service_delivery_platform","223734644_An_infrastructure_for_the_development_of_distributed_service-oriented_information_systems_for_precision_agriculture","221569715_Long-term_Software_Architecture_Management_with_Multi-Technology_Tool_Support","221281783_Web_Service-Based_Specification_and_Implementation_of_Functional_Components_in_Federated_ERP-Systems","220621600_CERA_A_collaborative_environment_reference_architecture_for_interoperable_CWE_systems","220385930_S3_A_Service-Oriented_Reference_Architecture","220032038_Sustainability_Evaluation_of_Software_Architectures_A_Systematic_Review","47616076_Reference_Architectural_Styles_for_Service-Oriented_Computing","27248824_The_inContext_Pervasive_Collaboration_Services_Architecture","4298887_AXMEDIS_as_the_Service_Oriented_Architecture_for_the_Media_Is_It_Feasible"]}
