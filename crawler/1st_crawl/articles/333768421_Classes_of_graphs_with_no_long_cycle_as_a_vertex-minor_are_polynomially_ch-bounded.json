{"id":"333768421_Classes_of_graphs_with_no_long_cycle_as_a_vertex-minor_are_polynomially_ch-bounded","abstract":"A class G of graphs is χ-bounded if there is a function f such that for every graph G∈G and every induced subgraph H of G, χ(H)⩽f(ω(H)). In addition, we say that G is polynomially χ-bounded if f can be taken as a polynomial function. We prove that for every integer n⩾3, there exists a polynomial f such that χ(G)⩽f(ω(G)) for all graphs with no vertex-minor isomorphic to the cycle graph Cn. To prove this, we show that if G is polynomially χ-bounded, then so is the closure of G under taking the 1-join operation.","authors":["Ringi Kim","O-joung Kwon","Sang-il Oum","Vaidyanathan Sivaraman"],"meta":["June 2019Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 140","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2019.06.001"],"references":["287419399_Vizing_Bound_for_the_Chromatic_Number_on_Some_Graph_Classes","28135867_The_Strong_Perfect_Graph_Theorem","328075808_Vertex-minors_and_the_Erdos-Hajnal_conjecture","327599061_Chi-boundedness_of_graph_classes_excluding_wheel_vertex-minors","311094290_Induced_Subgraphs_of_Graphs_with_Large_Chromatic_Number_III_Long_Holes","287251346_Coloring_graphs_without_fan_vertex-minors_and_graphs_without_cycle_pivot-minors","287148595_Chromatic_number_of_P5-free_graphs_Reed's_conjecture","268620905_Problems_from_the_world_surrounding_perfect_graphs","265628559_The_chromatic_number_of_P_5_K_4_-free_graphs","237197856_Unavoidable_vertex-minors_in_large_prime_graphs","228610707_Substitution_and_ch-boundedness","220076561_Ramsey's_Theorem_-_A_New_Lower_Bound","51916140_Classes_of_graphs_with_small_rank_decompositions_are_-bounded"]}
