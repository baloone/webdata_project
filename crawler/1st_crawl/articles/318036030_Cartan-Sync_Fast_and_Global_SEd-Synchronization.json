{"id":"318036030_Cartan-Sync_Fast_and_Global_SEd-Synchronization","abstract":"This work addresses the fundamental problem of Pose Graph Optimization (PGO), which is pervasive in the context of SLAM, and widely known as SE(d)-Synchronization in the mathematical community. Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a novel, elegant and compact matrix formulation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for this problem, drawing interesting connections with the Connection Laplacian of a graph object. Secondly, even though the MLE problem is non-convex and computationally intractable in general, we exploit recent advances in convex relaxations of PGO and Riemannian techniques for low-rank optimization to yield an a-posteriori certifiably globally optimal algorithm that is also fast and scalable.","authors":["Jesus Briales","Javier González-Jiménez"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LRA.2017.2718661","Project: Global optimality in SLAM"],"references":["318697661_Initialization_of_3D_pose_graph_optimization_using_Lagrangian_duality","304017872_The_non-convex_Burer-Monteiro_approach_works_on_smooth_semidefinite_programs","282936319_Initialization_techniques_for_3D_SLAM_A_survey_on_rotation_estimation_and_its_use_in_pose_graph_optimization","282687190_Duality-based_verification_techniques_for_2D_SLAM","277723264_Lagrangian_Duality_in_3D_SLAM_Verification_Techniques_and_Optimal_Solutions","268227160_Tightness_of_the_maximum_likelihood_semidefinite_relaxation_for_angular_synchronization","256091783_Manopt_a_Matlab_Toolbox_for_Optimization_on_Manifolds","254098771_iSAM2_Incremental_Smoothing_and_Mapping_Using_the_Bayes_Tree","226453009_A_Nonlinear_Programming_Algorithm_for_Solving_Semidefinite_Programs_via_Low-rank_Factorization","225703502_Local_Minima_and_Convergence_in_Low-Rank_Semidefinite_Programming","224131024_Semidefinite_Relaxation_of_Quadratic_Optimization_Problems","224053862_A_Cheeger_Inequality_for_the_Graph_Connection_Laplacian","220693013_Optimization_Algorithms_on_Matrix_Manifolds","2179633_The_Geometry_of_Algorithms_with_Orthogonality_Constraints","311842293_SE-Sync_A_Certifiably_Correct_Algorithm_for_Synchronization_over_the_Special_Euclidean_Group","311757260_Fast_global_optimality_verification_in_3D_SLAM","311299349_Synchronization_over_Cartan_Motion_Groups_via_Contraction","309606882_A_Certifiably_Correct_Algorithm_for_Synchronization_over_the_Special_Euclidean_Group","308823892_Lagrangian_duality_in_3D_SLAM_Verification_techniques_and_optimal_solutions","303320379_Planar_Pose_Graph_Optimization_Duality_Optimal_Solutions_and_Verification","288470635_Robust_graph_SLAM_back-ends_A_comparative_analysis","282739237_A_convex_relaxation_for_approximate_global_optimization_in_simultaneous_localization_and_mapping","281487178_A_note_on_Probably_Certifiably_Correct_algorithms","277603303_A_Riemannian_low-rank_method_for_optimization_over_semidefinite_matrices_with_block-diagonal_constraints","268296763_g_2_o_A_general_Framework_for_Hyper_Graph_Optimization","236177869_Trust_Region_Methods","229058134_Convex_Optimization","225120009_Trust-Region_Methods_on_Riemannian_Manifolds","48199394_Vector_Diffusion_Maps_and_the_Connection_Laplacian"]}
