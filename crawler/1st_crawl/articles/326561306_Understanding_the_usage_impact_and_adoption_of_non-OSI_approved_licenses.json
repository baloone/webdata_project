{"id":"326561306_Understanding_the_usage_impact_and_adoption_of_non-OSI_approved_licenses","abstract":"The software license is one of the most important non-executable pieces of any software system. However, due to its non-technical nature, developers often misuse or misunderstand software licenses. Although previous studies reported problems related to licenses clashes and inconsistencies, in this paper we shed the light on an important but yet overlooked issue: the use of non-approved open-source licenses. Such licenses claim to be open-source, but have not been formally approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). When a developer releases a software under a non-approved license, even if the interest is to make it open-source, the original author might not be granting the rights required by those who use the software. To uncover the reasons behind the use of non-approved licenses, we conducted a mix-method study, mining data from 657K open-source projects and their 4,367K versions, and surveying 76 developers that published some of these projects. Although 1,058,554 of the project versions employ at least one non-approved license, non-approved licenses account for 21.51% of license usage. We also observed that it is not uncommon for developers to change from a non-approved to an approved license. When asked, some developers mentioned that this transition was due to a better understanding of the disadvantages of using an non-approved license. This perspective is particularly important since developers often rely on package managers to easily and quickly get their dependencies working.","authors":["RÃ´mulo Meloca","Gustavo Pinto","Leonardo Baiser","Marco Mattos"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1145/3196398.3196427","Conference: the 15th International Conference"],"references":["318967775_Changes_in_free_and_open_source_software_licenses_managerial_interventions_and_variations_on_project_attractiveness","318877844_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Developer_Retention_in_the_RubyGems_and_npm_Software_Ecosystems","318868878_Why_Modern_Open_Source_Projects_Fail","316357070_How_are_Developers_Treating_License_Inconsistency_Issues_A_Case_Study_on_License_Inconsistency_Evolution_in_FOSS_Projects","311393837_Analysis_of_license_inconsistency_in_large_collections_of_open_source_projects","308732900_A_Method_to_Detect_License_Inconsistencies_in_Large-Scale_Open_Source_Projects","308729995_When_and_why_developers_adopt_and_change_software_licenses","303817538_License_usage_and_changes_a_large-scale_study_on_gitHub","303513465_More_Common_Than_You_Think_An_In-depth_Study_of_Casual_Contributors","281527594_An_in-depth_study_of_the_promises_and_perils_of_mining_GitHub","263847948_The_Promises_and_Perils_of_Mining_GitHub","262300990_Analyzing_the_Relationship_between_the_License_of_Packages_and_Their_Files_in_Free_and_Open_Source_Software","225124499_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Reuse_of_Software_Licensed_under_the_GNU_General_Public_License","224159778_Understanding_and_Auditing_the_Licensing_of_Open_Source_Software_Distributions","221555508_An_exploratory_study_of_the_evolution_of_software_licensing","318578485_Machine_Learning-Based_Detection_of_Open_Source_License_Exceptions","317605245_Do_Software_Developers_Understand_Open_Source_Licenses","303413505_A_look_at_the_dynamics_of_the_JavaScript_package_ecosystem","291827108_Crowdsourcing_Identification_of_License_Violations","288465856_Tracing_software_build_processes_to_uncover_license_compliance_inconsistencies","282905557_On_the_variability_of_the_BSD_and_MIT_licenses","270455253_An_insight_into_license_tools_for_open_source_software_systems","254058076_A_Method_for_Open_Source_License_Compliance_of_Java_Applications","236644407_Improving_Developer_Participation_Rates_in_Surveys","234792315_Open_Source_Licensing_Software_Freedom_and_Intellectual_Property_Law","221440375_An_Ethnographic_Study_of_Copy_and_Paste_Programming_Practices_in_OOPL","220277921_Cloning_considered_harmful_considered_harmful_patterns_of_cloning_in_software","220093009_Package_Management_Systems","200026371_Producing_Open_Source_Software_How_to_Run_a_Successful_Free_Software_Project"]}
