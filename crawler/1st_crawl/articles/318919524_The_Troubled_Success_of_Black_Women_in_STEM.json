{"id":"318919524_The_Troubled_Success_of_Black_Women_in_STEM","abstract":"We examine the experiences of 3 high-achieving Black undergraduate and graduate women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our findings reveal that structural racism, sexism, and race-gender bias were salient in the women's STEM settings. These experiences were sources of strain, which the women dealt with in ways that demonstrate both resilience and trauma. We discuss how their experiences might motivate institutions to offer support for high-achieving students who sometimes face risks from multiple sources.","authors":["Ebony McGee","Lydia Bentley"],"meta":["August 2017Cognition and Instruction","DOI:10.1080/07370008.2017.1355211"],"references":["356337021_Researching_Race_in_Mathematics_Education","316936347_Devalued_Black_and_Latino_Racial_Identities_A_By-Product_of_STEM_College_Culture","313666716_Black_faculty_coping_with_racial_battle_fatigue_The_campus_racial_climate_in_a_post-civil_rights_era","349832755_Emerging_Intersections_Race_Class_and_Gender_in_Theory_Policy_and_Practice","344532875_What's_Wrong_with_Evidence_Epistemological_Roots_and_Pedagogical_Implications_of_Evidence-based_Practice_in_STEM_Education","321462776_The_Path_to_Graduate_School_in_Science_and_Engineering_for_Underrepresented_Students_of_Color","317953643_Toward_a_Theory_of_Culturally_Relevant_Pedagogy","313175548_Demarginalizing_the_intersection_of_race_and_sex_A_black_feminist_critique_of_antidiscrimination_doctrine_feminist_theory_and_antiracist_politics","308926748_Designing_Qualitative_Research","305369030_Innovating_inequity_if_race_is_a_technology_postracialism_is_the_genius_bar"]}
