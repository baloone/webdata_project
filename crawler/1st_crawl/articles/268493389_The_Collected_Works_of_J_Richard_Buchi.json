{"id":"268493389_The_Collected_Works_of_J_Richard_Buchi","abstract":"Let SC be the interpreted formalism which makes use of individual variables t, x, y, z,... ranging over natural numbers, monadic predicate variables q( ), r( ), s( ), i( ),... ranging over arbitrary sets of natural numbers, the individual symbol 0 standing for zero, the function symbol ′ denoting the successor function, propositional connectives, and quantifiers for both types of variables. Thus SC is a fraction of the restricted second order theory of natural numbers, or of the first order theory of real numbers. In fact, if predicates on natural numbers are interpreted as binary expansions of real numbers, it is easy to see that SC is equivalent to the first order theory of [Re, +, Pw, Nn], whereby Re, Pw, Nn are, respectively, the sets of non-negative reals, integral powers of 2, and natural numbers.","authors":["J.
