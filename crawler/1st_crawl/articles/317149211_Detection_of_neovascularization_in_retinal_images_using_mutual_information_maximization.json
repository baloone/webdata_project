{"id":"317149211_Detection_of_neovascularization_in_retinal_images_using_mutual_information_maximization","abstract":"Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is characterized by the proliferation of new abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization) that cause their detachment from retina. An automated computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system is developed for neovascularization (new abnormal blood vessel) detection on retinal images. Curvelet transform is used to intensify the fine details of the vascular network followed by maximization of mutual information (MI) on the maximum matched filter response for optimal thresholding to partition the vessels into the thick and the thin categories. Vessel density and tortuosity, being two unique and distinct features for the abnormal vessels, are calculated from the thin vessel class followed by MI maximization and post-processing for neovascularization detection. Simulation results demonstrate that an average accuracy gain of 97.49% is achieved by the proposed method in abnormal vessel detection over the existing methods.","authors":["Sudeshna Sil Kar","Santi Maity"],"meta":["May 2017Computers & Electrical Engineering 62","DOI:10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.05.012"],"references":["270293872_Retinal_vessel_extraction_using_Lattice_Neural_Networks_with_Dendritic_Processing","260625531_Retinal_vessel_segmentation_by_improved_matched_filtering_Evaluation_on_a_new_high-resolution_fundus_image_database","51627418_Detection_of_Neovascularization_in_Diabetic_Retinopathy","49673505_Retinal_Image_Analysis_Using_Curvelet_Transform_and_Multistructure_Elements_Morphology_by_Reconstruction","12442679_Locating_Blood_Vessels_in_Retinal_Images_by_Piecewise_Threshold_Probing_of_a_Matched_Filter_Response","8619377_Ridge-Based_Vessel_Segmentation_in_Color_Images_of_the_Retina","4248294_Studies_on_Fuzzy_Information_Measures","3220187_Detection_of_blood_vessels_in_retinal_images_using_two-dimensional_matched_filter","282569099_Segmentation_of_retinal_vessels_by_means_of_directional_response_vector_similarity_and_region_growing","272374309_Improvement_of_Retinal_Blood_Vessel_Detection_Using_Morphological_Component_Analysis","265471858_A_self-adaptive_matched_filter_for_retinal_blood_vessel_detection","262691322_Retinal_vessel_segmentation_employing_ANN_technique_by_Gabor_and_moment_invariants-based_features","260438859_Automated_detection_of_proliferative_diabetic_retinopathy_using_a_modified_line_operator_and_dual_classification","257690641_Automatic_wavelet-based_retinal_blood_vessels_segmentation_and_vessel_diameter_estimation","235388040_Detection_of_neovascularization_in_the_optic_disc_using_an_AM-FM_representation_granulometry_and_vessel_segmentation","230725818_Small_retinal_vessels_extraction_towards_proliferative_diabetic_retinopathy_screening","222682321_Enhancing_retinal_image_by_the_Contourlet_transform","222571833_Estimation_of_the_curvature_of_an_interface_from_a_digital_2D_image","221623696_Fully_automatic_3D_segmentation_of_coronary_arteries_based_on_mathematical_morphology","49681788_Detection_of_New_Vessels_on_the_Optic_Disc_Using_Retinal_Photographs"]}
