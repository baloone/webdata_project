{"id":"265797545_A_Note_on_Linear_Codes_over_Semigroup_Rings","abstract":"We introduce new construction techniques of BCH, alternant, Goppa, Srivastava codes through the semigroup ring B[X;1 3ℤ 0 ] instead of the polynomial ring B[X;ℤ 0 ], where B is a finite commutative ring with identity, and for these constructions we improve the several results of [the first author and R. Palazzo jun., ibid. 6, No. 2, 207–217 (2005; Zbl 1208.94065)]. After this, we present a decoding principle for BCH, alternant and Goppa codes which is based on modified Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. This algorithm corrects all errors up tothe Hamming weight t≤r/2, i.e., whose minimum Hamming distance is r+1.","authors":["Antonio Andrade","Tariq Shah","Atlas Khan"],"meta":["August 2011TEMA (São Carlos) 12(2)","DOI:10.5540/tema.2010.012.02.0079"],"references":["262480615_Encoding_through_generalized_polynomial_codes","246194080_Finite_Rings_with_Identity","242369129_Linear_Codes_over_Finite_Rings1","235410288_Error_Correcting_Codes","37687860_Commutative_Semigroup_Rings","3081023_On_decoding_BCH_codes","3079230_On_the_decoding_of_Reed-Solomon_and_BCH_codes_over_integer_residue_rings"]}
