{"id":"243577219_Interpretation_of_Mueller_matrices_based_on_polar_decomposition","abstract":"We present an algorithm that decomposes a Mueller matrix into a sequence of three matrix factors: a diattenuator, followed by a retarder, then followed by a depolarizer. Those factors are unique except for singular Mueller matrices. Based on this decomposition, the diattenuation and the retardance of a Mueller matrix can be defined and computed. Thus this algorithm is useful for performing data reduction upon experimentally determined Mueller matrices.","authors":["Shih-Yau Lu","Russell A Chipman"],"meta":["May 1996Journal of the Optical Society of America A 13(5)","DOI:10.1364/JOSAA.13.001106"],"references":["285501014_Eigenstates_of_polarization_in_lasers","265628651_An_eigenvalue_criterion_for_matrices_transforming_Stokes_parameters","243576797_Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions_for_a_Mueller_matrix_to_be_derivable_from_a_Jones_matrix","243402084_Normal_form_for_Mueller_Matrices_in_Polarization_Optics","238961177_Conditions_for_the_Physical_Realizability_of_Polarization_Matrices_Characterizing_Passive_Systems","238241172_Homogeneous_and_inhomogeneous_Jones_matrices","233166245_On_the_Deterministic_and_Non-deterministic_Mueller_Matrix","222721892_Nondepolarizing_systems_and_degree_of_polarization","23893494_Polarization_Analysis_Of_Optical_Systems"]}
