{"id":"332271817_Sketch_simplification_guided_by_complex_agglomeration","abstract":"We propose a novel method for vector sketch simplification based on the simplification of the geometric structure that is extracted from the input vector graph, which can be referred to as a base complex. Unlike the sets of strokes, which are treated in the existing approaches, a base complex is considered to be a collection of various geometric primitives. Guided by the shape similarity metrics that are defined for the base complex, an agglomeration procedure is proposed to simplify the base complex by iteratively merging a pair of geometric primitives that exhibit the minimum cost into a new one. This simplified base complex is finally converted into a simplified vector graph. Our algorithm is computationally efficient and is able to retain a large amount of useful shape information from the original vector graph, thereby achieving a tradeoff between efficiency and geometric fidelity. Furthermore, the level of simplification of the input vector graph can be easily controlled using a single threshold in our method. We make comparisons with some existing methods using the datasets that have been provided in the corresponding studies as well as using different styles of sketches drawn by artists. Thus, our experiments demonstrate the computational efficiency of our method and its capability for producing the desirable results.","authors":["Yue Liu","Xuemei Li","Pengbo Bo","Xifeng Gao"],"meta":["May 2019Sciece China.
