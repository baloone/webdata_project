{"id":"288319634_Common_knowledge_Orchestrating_synchronously_blended_f2f_discourse_in_the_elementary_classroom","abstract":"This study reports on the continued development of Common Knowledge (CK) - a pedagogical and technological innovation that supports knowledge building blended discourse. Students use handheld tablets to contribute notes to a community knowledge base, which is publicly displayed on the classroom's interactive whiteboard (IWB). This aggregate display provides students with a powerful visualization of the community's idea flow. The IWB display further provides teachers with \"at-a-glance\" formative assessment of students' thinking and supports spontaneous adjustments to their orchestration of inquiry activities and blended discourse. This paper presents a study of how CK supports student and teacher discourse in inquiry science.","authors":["Chow Mun Fong","R. Cober","C.
