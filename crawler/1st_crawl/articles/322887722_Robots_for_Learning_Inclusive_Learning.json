{"id":"322887722_Robots_for_Learning_Inclusive_Learning","abstract":"The Robots for Learning workshop series aims at advancing the research topics related to the use of social robots in educational contexts. The full-day workshop follows on previous events in Human-Robot Interaction conferences focusing on efforts to design, develop and test new robotics systems that help learners. This 4th edition of the workshop will be deal- ing in particular on the potential use of robots for inclusive learning. Since the past few years, inclusive education have been a key policy in a number of countries, aiming to provide equal changes and common ground to all. In this workshop, we aim to discuss strategies to design robotics system able to adapt to the learnersâ€™ abilities, to provide assistance and to demonstrate long-term learning effects.","authors":["Wafa Johal","James Kennedy","Vicky Charisi","Hae Won Park"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1145/3173386.3173567","Conference: ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot InteractionAt: Chicago, USA"],"references":["314160005_Telling_Stories_to_Robots_The_Effect_of_Backchanneling_on_a_Child's_Storytelling","301324078_Learning_by_Teaching_a_Robot_The_Case_of_Handwriting","297710634_Social_Robot_Tutoring_for_Child_Second_Language_Learning","314291235_Workshop_on_Robots_for_Learning_R4L","314164548_Cellulo_Versatile_Handheld_Robots_for_Education","278086326_Empathic_Robots_for_Long-term_Interaction","255730058_Towards_Empathic_Virtual_and_Robotic_Tutors"]}
