Many researches are contributing to define the potential differences of individual preferences in learning. In this paper, we present an interactive Web-based instrument to initiate students’ learning style. The instrument uses learner’s interaction with learning objects as hint and representing them as the students’ learning style. By applying the instrument, we have been able to detect initial learning styles accurately. Evaluation of our experimental results showed high precision. Besides, very high satisfactory feedbacks were received from students. Based on the mentioned benefits and study results, our method has potential influence on defining individual’s preference in learning","authors":["Doniyorbek Qambaralievich Ahmadaliev","Chen Xiaohui","Murodjon Abduvohidov"],"meta":["December 2018International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 13(12):238","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v13i12.8725"],"references":["312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","228403640_Index_of_Learning_Styles_Questionnaire","227637505_Learning_and_Teaching_Styles_In_Foreign_and_Second_Language_Education","344541652_A_Study_Of_The_Reliability_And_Validity_Of_The_Felder_Soloman_Index_Of_Learning_Styles","317965861_Prediction_of_Learner's_Profile_Based_on_Learning_Styles_in_Adaptive_E-learning_System","317266198_Adaptive_Educational_Hypermedia_Systems_based_on_Learning_Styles_the_Case_of_Adaptation_Rules","287649046_The_experiential_learning_theory_of_development","246670283_Learning_Styles_And_Pedagogy_In_Post-16_Learning_A_Systematic_And_Critical_Review","236661911_A_literature-based_method_to_automatically_detect_learning_styles_in_learning_management_systems","232830566_A_genetic_algorithm_approach_to_recognise_students'_learning_styles"]}
