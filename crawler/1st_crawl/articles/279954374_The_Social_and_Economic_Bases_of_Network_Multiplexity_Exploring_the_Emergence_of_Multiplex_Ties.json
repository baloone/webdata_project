{"id":"279954374_The_Social_and_Economic_Bases_of_Network_Multiplexity_Exploring_the_Emergence_of_Multiplex_Ties","abstract":"The goal of this article is to shed light on the role of tie content in the evolution of multiplex ties – i.e., ties featuring both an economic and a social component – in interorganizational networks. The authors clarify and extend the theoretical framework on network multiplexity by testing the extent to which two distinct tie content-related logics – social interaction and economic exchange – and their underlying mechanisms lead to the emergence of multiplex ties. Results from a longitudinal network analysis of firms located in an Italian multimedia cluster support the authors’ hypotheses, confirming that both social and economic drivers contribute to the emergence of network multiplexity, and that social ties have a stronger impact than economic ties on this process, thus providing further insight into the microdynamics of network evolution.","authors":["Simone Ferriani","Fabio Fonti","Raffaele Corrado"],"meta":["February 2013Strategic Organization 11(1):7-34","DOI:10.1177/1476127012461576","Project: Drivers and consequences of network embeddedness"],"references":["315374629_INDIVIDUAL_AND_STRUCTURAL_ORIGINS_OF_FRIENDSHIP_AND_SOCIAL_POSITION_AMONG_PROFESSIONALS","288281687_The_Role_of_Instrumental_and_Expressive_Social_Ties_in_Employees'_Perceptions_of_Organizational_Justice","284900890_Economic_Multiplicity_The_Structural_Embeddedness_of_Cooperation_in_Multiple_Relations_of_Interdependence","325001218_Retrospective_Reports_In_Organizational_Research_A_Reexamination_Of_Recent_Evidence","313655769_A_Network_Model_of_Organization_Formation","313199364_The_Correlates_of_Entrepreneurship_in_Three_Types_of_Firms","313114830_Introduction_to_actor-based_models_for_network_dynamics","298475715_The_Genesis_and_Dynamics_of_Organizational_Networks_March_pg_434_2012","286012439_The_Social_Psychology_of_Organizations","284065697_Dal_settore_industriale_al_distretto_industriale_Alcune_considerazioni_sull'unita_di_indagine_in_economia_industriale"]}
