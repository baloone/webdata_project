{"id":"313692557_Enhancing_practice_and_achievement_in_introductory_programming_using_an_ADRI_editor","abstract":"Practice is considered an important step in grasping the precise concepts of computer programming for novices. An editor plays an integral part in promoting practice and acquiring programming skills. Most of the programming editors available in the market promote programming shortcut (to convert the problem statement directly into a computer program). In this study, a new editor was introduced in the introductory programming (IP) course based on the ADRI approach which discourages programming shortcut. Moreover, it focuses on paying equal attention to programming knowledge (syntax & syntax) and problem solving strategies. The results show improvement in achieving students' learning outcomes and positive impact on attrition rate. Students (treatment group) who used the ADRI editor show more satisfaction on using the program development environment compared to the control group.","authors":["Sohail Iqbal Malik"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/TALE.2016.7851766","Conference: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering (TALE)"],"references":["295902185_A_model_for_teaching_an_introductory_programming_course_using_ADRI","272910901_A_Self_Review_and_External_Review_Model_for_Teaching_and_Assessing_Novice_Programmers","242400379_Using_Animated_3D_Graphics_to_Prepare_Novices_for_CS1","237524669_PROBLEMS_IN_LEARNING_AND_TEACHING_PROGRAMMING_-_a_literature_study_for_developing_visualizations_in_the_Codewitz-Minerva_project","232824810_Quality_Improvement_through_Quality_Audit","315081107_Pro_Java_8_Programming","314816876_DrJava_a_lightweight_pedagogic_environment_for_Java","242354560_Objects_first_with_java_a_practical_introduction_using_bluej","241622540_Reducing_the_dropout_rate_in_an_introductory_programming_course","234814198_Programming_pedagogy-A_psychological_overview"]}
