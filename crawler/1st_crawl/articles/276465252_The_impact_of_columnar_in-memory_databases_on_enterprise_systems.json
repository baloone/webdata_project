{"id":"276465252_The_impact_of_columnar_in-memory_databases_on_enterprise_systems","abstract":"Five years ago I proposed a common database approach for transaction processing and analytical systems using a columnar in-memory database, disputing the common belief that column stores are not suitable for transactional workloads. Today, the concept has been widely adopted in academia and industry and it is proven that it is feasible to run analytical queries on large data sets directly on a redundancy-free schema, eliminating the need to maintain pre-built aggregate tables during data entry transactions. The resulting reduction in transaction complexity leads to a dramatic simplification of data models and applications, redefining the way we build enterprise systems. First analyses of productive applications adopting this concept confirm that system architectures enabled by in-memory column stores are conceptually superior for business transaction processing compared to row-based approaches. Additionally, our analyses show a shift of enterprise workloads to even more read-oriented processing due to the elimination of updates of transactionmaintained aggregates.","authors":["Hasso Plattner"],"meta":["August 2014Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 7(13):1722-1729","DOI:10.14778/2733004.2733074"],"references":["221310140_Sybase_IQ_Multiplex-Designed_For_Analytics"]}
