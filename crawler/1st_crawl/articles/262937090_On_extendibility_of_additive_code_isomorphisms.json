{"id":"262937090_On_extendibility_of_additive_code_isomorphisms","abstract":"The paper deals with the extendibility of additive code isomorphisms. For\nlinear codes, the MacWilliams Extension Theorem claims that every linear\nisomorphism of a code extends to linear isomorphism of the whole space. But, in\ngeneral, this is not the situation for nonlinear codes. We prove that if the\nlength of an additive code is less than some threshold value, then an analogue\nof the MacWilliams Extension Theorem holds. One family of unextendible code\nisomorphisms for the threshold value of code length is described.","authors":["Serhii Dyshko"],"meta":["June 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["252540177_Finite_Quasi-Frobenius_Modules_and_Linear_Codes","226228001_On_the_Extendability_of_Code_Isometries","220301349_On_the_equivalence_of_codes_over_rings_and_modules","268634698_Duality_For_Modules_Over_Finite_Rings_And_Applications_To_Coding_Theory","252988470_FOUNDATIONS_OF_LINEAR_CODES_DEFINED_OVER_FINITE_MODULES_THE_EXTENSION_THEOREM_AND_THE_MACWILLIAMS_IDENTITIES","242963546_On_the_representation_of_vector_spaces_as_a_finite_union_of_subspaces","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","230609346_Covering_Numbers_in_Linear_Algebra","227029996_To_the_Metrical_Rigidity_of_Binary_Codes","226394832_On_the_concept_of_code-isomorphy","225507777_On_metric_rigidity_for_some_classes_of_codes","223208194_A_characterization_of_flat_spaces_in_a_finite_geometry_and_the_uniqueness_of_the_hamming_and_the_MacDonald_codes","223062258_Finite-Ring_Combinatorics_and_MacWilliams'_Equivalence_Theorem","220248341_An_Elementary_Proof_of_the_MacWilliams_Theorem_on_Equivalence_of_Codes","220074461_Characters_and_the_Equivalence_of_Codes"]}
