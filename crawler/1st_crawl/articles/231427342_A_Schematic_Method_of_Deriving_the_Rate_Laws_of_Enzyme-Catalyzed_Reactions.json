{"id":"231427342_A_Schematic_Method_of_Deriving_the_Rate_Laws_of_Enzyme-Catalyzed_Reactions","abstract":"A schematic method of deriving the rate laws for enzyme-catalyzed reactions is described which is particularly useful for treating very complicated mechanisms. It is proved that this schematic method is valid for deriving the rate law for any enzyme catalysis mechanism regardless of the number of enzyme-containing species which are involved. Allowance for interactions which do not involve the enzyme is not within the scope of this method but is readily taken into account by usual means.","authors":["Edward L.
