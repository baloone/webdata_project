In other words, blockchain technology is a shared and immutable notebook. This technology is used to record transactions, track assets and build trust. All transactions are stored encrypted by all stakeholders in the blockchain network. Auditing of these transactions is the domain of the auditors. The dynamics of auditing are changing with the developing technology. As a reflection of blockchain technology, professional profiles of auditors are also changing. The purpose of this study is to discuss the change in professional profiles of auditors in the light of blockchain technology. Jel Codes: M40, M41, M42. In this study, research was conducted on blockchain technology, audit and auditors. First, a literature review was conducted. Then, information about blockchain technology and blockchain control was given. Finally, the effect of blockchain technology on auditors was discussed and changes in profession profiles are discussed.","authors":["Hayrettin Usul","GÃ¶zde Karaburun"],"meta":["August 2020"],"references":["339052644_Blokzincir_Blockchain'in_Kamu_Idaresine_Olasi_Etkileri_Uzerine","338014104_BLOKZINCIRI_VE_MUHASEBE_ALANINDAKI_UYGULAMALARI","336713635_VERGI_DENETIMINDE_YENI_BIR_YAKLASIM_OLARAK_BLOK_ZINCIRI_TEKNOLOJISI","335472340_How_Will_Blockchain_Technology_Impact_Auditing_and_Accounting_Permissionless_Vs_Permissioned_Blockchain","331409918_THE_RISE_OF_CRYPTOCURRENCIES_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK_AND_WHERE_BITCOIN_STANDS_IN_TODAY_S_WORLD","337119888_Impacts_of_Digitization_on_Auditing_A_Delphi_Study_for_Germany","337047633_Dredas_Decentralized_reliable_and_efficient_remote_outsourced_data_auditing_scheme_with_blockchain_smart_contract_for_industrial_IoT","332658920_Reengineering_the_Audit_with_Blockchain_and_Smart_Contracts","331321240_BLOKZINCIR_TEKNOLOJISININ_YONETIM_SURECLERINE_OLASI_ETKILERI_UZERINE_INCELEME","330489730_A_Primer_for_Information_Technology_General_Control_Considerations_on_a_Private_and_Permissioned_Blockchain_Audit","326693806_Acik_ve_uzaktan_ogrenmede_blokzincir_teknolojisinin_kullanimi","326038782_Designing_confidentiality-preserving_Blockchain-based_transaction_processing_systems"]}
