{"id":"301827878_Using_Dictionary_and_Lemmatizer_to_Improve_Low_Resource_English-Malay_Statistical_Machine_Translation_System","abstract":"Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is one of the most popular methods for machine translation. In this work, we carried out English-Malay SMT by acquiring an English-Malay parallel corpus in computer science domain. On the other hand, the training parallel corpus is from a general domain. Thus, there will be a lot of out of vocabulary during translation. We attempt to improve the English-Malay SMT in computer science domain using a dictionary and an English lemmatizer. Our study shows that a combination of approach using bilingual dictionary and English lemmatization improves the BLEU score for English to Malay translation from 12.90 to 15.41.","authors":["Yin-Lai Yeong","Tien-Ping Tan","Siti Khaotijah Mohammad"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Computer Science 81:243-249","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2016.04.056"],"references":["303672008_Style_in_Translation","272091377_The_Stanford_CoreNLP_Natural_Language_Processing_Toolkit","303672084_Building_a_Chinese-English_Parallel_Corpus_of_Modern_and_Contemporary_Chinese_Novels","277177332_Adapting_An_Existing_Example-Based_Machine_Translation_EBMT_System_For_New_Language_Pairs_Based_On_An_Optimized_Bilingual_Knowledge_Bank_BKB","272198680_A_computational_study_on_high-valent_mono-oxo-rheniumV_complex-catalyzed_hydrosilylation_of_carbonyls_What_a_difference_an_oxo_ligand_makes","270878785_Continuous_Space_Translation_Models_for_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation","243769995_Experiments_in_Multilingual_Example-Based_Generation","242637644_An_Algorithm_for_Suffix_Stripping","239066288_Snowball_A_language_for_stemming_algorithms","238767481_Real_Time_On-Line_English-Malay_Machine_Translation_MT_System"]}
