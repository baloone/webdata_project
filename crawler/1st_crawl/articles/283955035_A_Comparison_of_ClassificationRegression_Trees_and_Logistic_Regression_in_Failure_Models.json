{"id":"283955035_A_Comparison_of_ClassificationRegression_Trees_and_Logistic_Regression_in_Failure_Models","abstract":"The use of non-parametric statistical methods, the development of models geared towards the homogeneous characteristics of corporate sub-populations, and the introduction of non-financial variables, are three main issues analysed in this paper. This study compares the predictive performance of a non-parametric methodology, namelyClassification/Regression Trees (CART), against traditional logistic regression (LR) by employing a vast set of matched-pair accounts of the smallest enterprises, known as micro-entities,from the United Kingdom for the period 1999 to 2008 that includes financial, non-financial, and macroeconomic variables. Our findings show that CART outperforms the standard approach in the literature, LR.","authors":["Ana Irimia Di√©guez","A. Blanco-Oliver","M. J.
