{"id":"259010202_Topology_of_the_view_complex","abstract":"This paper concerns itself with a family of simplicial complexes, which we\ncall the {\\it view complexes}. Our choice of objects of study is motivated by\ntheoretical distributed computing, since the view complex is a key simplicial\nconstruction used for protocol complexes in the plain read-write computational\nmodel. We show that the view complex View$_n$ can be collapsed to the\nwell-known complex $\\chi(\\Delta^n)$, called standard chromatic subdivision of a\nsimplex, and that $\\chi(\\Delta^n)$ is itself collapsible. Furthermore, we show\nthat the collapses can be performed simultaneously in entire orbits of the\nnatural symmetric group action. Our results yield a purely combinatorial and\nconstructive understanding of the topology of view complexes.","authors":["Dmitry N.
