This study aimed to identify the exposure of personal data in social networks, which may be potential tools for dissemination of inaccurate facts and source of disorders in the process of information sharing and communication, such as violation of data security policies. To achieve\nthis goal, a bibliographic review was first carried out based on the discussion of the topic of communication, data security and current problems in the midst of social networks, such as fakenews. Subsequently, the questionnaire was developed, or data collection form. It was used in the research, a group composed of ten online profiles for analysis and eight researchers graduating from a Computer Science course. The data were processed under a simple statistical process, identifying frequencies and means. Significant rates of private data exposure have been identified in online social networks","authors":["Daniel Costa de Paiva","Francisco de Assis Silva Oliveira"],"meta":["June 2019","Project: TEC (Tecnologia, Educação e Cognição)"],"references":["315493700_Coleta_de_Dados_em_Redes_Sociais_privacidade_de_dados_pessoais_no_acesso_via_Application_Programming_Interface","270960171_Human_Information_Behavior","318494447_The_Second_Self_Computers_and_the_Human_Spirit","312914281_Information_needs_and_uses","311850384_Ciclo_de_vida_dos_dados_uma_perspectiva_a_partir_da_ciencia_da_informacao","285425690_Information_needs_and_uses","256393863_Annual_review_of_information_science_and_technology","247826297_The_Data_Warehouse_Toolkit_The_Complete_Guide_to_Dimensional_Modeling","243771973_A_practical_electronic_cash_system","242801762_Annual_review_of_information_science_and_technology","233966722_O_professor_iniciante_a_pratica_pedagogica_eo_sentido_da_experiencia","228915526_Losses_gains_and_hyperbolic_discounting_An_experimental_approach_to_information_security_attitudes_and_behavior","220690118_The_relational_database_dictionary_-_a_comprehensive_glossary_of_relational_terms_and_concepts_with_illustrative_examples","220614202_A_qualitative_study_of_users'_view_on_information_security"]}
