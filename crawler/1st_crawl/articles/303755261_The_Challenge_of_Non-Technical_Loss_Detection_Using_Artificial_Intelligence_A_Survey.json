{"id":"303755261_The_Challenge_of_Non-Technical_Loss_Detection_Using_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Survey","abstract":"Detection of non-technical losses (NTL) which include electricity theft, faulty meters or billing errors\nhas attracted increasing attention from researchers in electrical engineering and computer science. NTLs\ncause significant harm to the economy, as in some countries they may range up to 40% of the total\nelectricity distributed. The predominant research direction is employing artificial intelligence to predict\nwhether a customer causes NTL. This paper first provides an overview of how NTLs are defined and their\nimpact on economies, which include loss of revenue and profit of electricity providers and decrease of the\nstability and reliability of electrical power grids. It then surveys the state-of-the-art research efforts in a\nup-to-date and comprehensive review of algorithms, features and data sets used. It finally identifies the\nkey scientific and engineering challenges in NTL detection and suggests how they could be addressed in\nthe future.","authors":["Patrick Glauner","Jorge Augusto Meira","Petko Valtchev","Radu State"],"meta":["February 2017International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems 10(1):760-775","DOI:10.2991/ijcis.2017.10.1.51","Project: Machine Learning for Detection of Non-Technical Losses"],"references":["304826423_Neighborhood_Features_Help_Detecting_Non-Technical_Losses_in_Big_Data_Sets","301845536_Large-Scale_Detection_of_Non-Technical_Losses_in_Imbalanced_Data_Sets","301839500_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","283233070_Electricity_theft_detection_using_smart_meter_data","319394978_Artificial_Intelligence_---_A_Modern_Approach","312447227_Detection_of_abnormalities_and_electricity_theft_using_genetic_support_vector_machines","306023507_A_protocol_for_the_ranking_of_interpolation_algorithms_based_on_confidence_levels","303157903_Visualizing_High-Dimensional_Data_using_t-SNE","284675933_Spatial_point_processes_and_their_applications_Stochastic_geometry"]}
