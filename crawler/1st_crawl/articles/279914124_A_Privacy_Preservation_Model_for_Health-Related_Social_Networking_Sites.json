{"id":"279914124_A_Privacy_Preservation_Model_for_Health-Related_Social_Networking_Sites","abstract":"The increasing use of social networking sites (SNS) in health care has resulted in a growing number\nof individuals posting personal health information online. These sites may disclose users' health\ninformation to many different individuals and organizations and mine it for a variety of commercial and\nresearch purposes, yet the revelation of personal health information to unauthorized individuals or\nentities brings a concomitant concern of greater risk for loss of privacy among users. Many users join\nmultiple social networks for different purposes and enter personal and other specific information\ncovering social, professional, and health domains into other websites. Integration of multiple online\nand real social networks makes the users vulnerable to unintentional and intentional security threats\nand misuse. This paper analyzes the privacy and security characteristics of leading health related\nSNS. It presents a threat model and identifies the most important threats to users and SNS providers.\nBuilding on threat analysis and modeling, this paper presents a privacy preservation model that\nincorporates individual self protection and privacy by design approaches and uses the model to\ndevelop principles and countermeasures to protect user privacy. This study paves the way for\nanalysis and design of privacy preserving mechanisms on health related SNS.","authors":["Jingquan Li"],"meta":["July 2015Journal of Medical Internet Research"],"references":[]}
