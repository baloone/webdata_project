{"id":"224546201_A_new_method_of_load-shedding_control_on_centrifugal_water_chiller_sequencing","abstract":"This paper presents a simplified method of accomplishing the direct load control (DLC) program from Taiwan Power Company (TPC) with the building HVAC system efficiency maximum. Instead of the coefficient of performance (COP) maximum for multiple centrifugal water chillers system, a program with cooling load maximum is approved to be more effective for the electricity load-shedding customer. Based on the hardware resource on I-7188XA with 512k SRAM, we employed an algorithm with penalty function method (PFM) and simplex method (SM) compiled by C++. Comparing with the Lingo simulation, this result was close to the global optimal result. Because of this algorithm leads to the rapid computation speed and minimal ROM requirements, it is applicable to the actual control hardware condition.","authors":["Jiao Lei","Han Ning","Leehter Yao"],"meta":["June 2009","DOI:10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138793","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Industrial Electronics and Applications, 2009.
