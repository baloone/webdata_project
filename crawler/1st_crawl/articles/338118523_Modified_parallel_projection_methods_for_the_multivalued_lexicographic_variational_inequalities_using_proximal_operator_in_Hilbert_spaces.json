First, the strong convergence theorem is shown with Lipschitz continuity of the cost mapping, but it must satisfy a strongly monotone condition. Second, the convergent results are also established to the multivalued lexicographic variational inequalities involving a finite system of demicontractive mappings under mild assumptions imposed on parameters. Finally, some numerical examples are developed to illustrate the behavior of our algorithms with respect to existing algorithms.","authors":["Pham Ngoc Anh","Hoai An Le Thi"],"meta":["April 2020Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences 43(6)","DOI:10.1002/mma.6118"],"references":["304366400_An_algorithm_for_a_class_of_split_feasibility_problems_application_to_a_model_in_electricity_production","283553522_A_projection-fixed_point_method_for_a_class_of_bilevel_variational_inequalities_with_split_fixed_point_constraints","321610549_Equilibrium_Problems_and_Variational_Models","319904500_Convergence_Theorems_for_Variational_Inequalities_on_the_Solution_Set_of_Ky_Fan_Inequalities","318833106_Strong_Convergence_Theorem_for_the_Lexicographic_Ky_Fan_Inequality","312611841_Weak_and_strong_convergence_to_fixed_points_of_asymptotically_nonexpansive_mappings","304031889_A_splitting_algorithm_for_a_class_of_bilevel_equilibrium_problems_involving_nonexpansive_mappings","289502425_Outer-Inner_Approximation_Projection_Methods_for_Multivalued_Variational_Inequalities","282370150_Nonconvex_Optimization_and_Its_Applications","280022941_On_the_convergence_of_combined_relaxation_methods_for_variational_inequalities","272521824_Projected_Reflected_Gradient_Methods_for_Monotone_Variational_Inequalities","266343611_Viscosity_method_for_hierarchical_fixed_point_approach_to_variational_inequalities","266965174_On_Bilevel_Variational_Inequalities","265873028_Equilibrium_problems_nonsmooth_optimization_and_variational_inequality_models","264919355_A_new_extragradient_iteration_algorithm_for_bilevel_variational_inequalities"]}
