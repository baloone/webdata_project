{"id":"353598901_Symmetric_and_Non-symmetric_Mixed_Games_Games_with_a_Combination_of_Chance_and_no_Chance","abstract":"We introduce and study the notion of a class of games which are the combination of the elements of chance (e.g., rolling one or two dice) and no-chance (e.g., choosing one or two numbers) by the players alternatively. Explicitly, we provide and discuss a method that converts a no-chance-based game such as an impartial combinatorial game into a mixed game and a chance-based game such as backgammon into a mixed game. In a nutshell, we show how to invent many new games associated to impartial combinatorial and non-combinatorial (standard) tabletop board (dice-rolled) games that besides their recreational values for different age ranges, they open a new window and provide a solid platform for academic studies in the fields of mathematics, computer science, artificial intelligence, and game theory. Finally, we end the paper with a short philosophical speculation and exposition related to the extended mixed games and quantum mechanics.","authors":["Amir M.
