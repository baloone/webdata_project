{"id":"279201505_A_hybrid_Tabu_search-simulated_annealing_method_to_solve_quadratic_assignment_problem","abstract":"Quadratic assignment problem (QAP) has been considered as one of the most complicated\nproblems. The problem is NP-Hard and the optimal solutions are not available for large-scale\nproblems. This paper presents a hybrid method using tabu search and simulated annealing\ntechnique to solve QAP called TABUSA. Using some well-known problems from QAPLIB\ngenerated by Burkard et al. (1997) [Burkard, R. E., Karisch, S. E., & Rendl, F. (1997).\nQAPLIB–a quadratic assignment problem library. Journal of Global Optimization, 10(4), 391-\n403.], two methods of TABUSA and TS are both coded on MATLAB and they are compared in\nterms of relative percentage deviation (RPD) for all instances. The performance of the proposed\nmethod is examined against Tabu search and the preliminary results indicate that the hybrid\nmethod is capable of solving real-world problems, efficiently.","authors":["Mohamad Amin Kaviani","Mehdi Abbasi","Bentolhoda Rahpeyma","Mohamad Mehdi Yusefi"],"meta":["May 2014Decision Science Letters 3(3):391–396","DOI:10.5267/j.dsl.2014.2.004"],"references":["277474071_Tabu_search-part_II","274310216_A_New_Reformulation_and_an_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","272913824_Integrated_quadratic_assignment_and_continuous_facility_layout_problem","238085345_FUTURE_PATHS_FOR_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING_AND_LINKS_TO_AR_TIFI_CIAL_INTELLI_G_EN_CE","302201675_Quadratic_Assignment_Problems","271837973_The_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem_Theory_and_Algorithms","268309953_The_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem_Theory_and_Algorithms","261394077_Metaheuristic_algorithms_for_the_quadratic_assignment_problem","259125968_Tabu_search_vs_simulated_annealing_as_a_function_of_the_size_of_quadratic_assignment_problem_instances","239060044_Solving_Quadratic_Assignment_Problems_By_'Simulated_Annealing'"]}
