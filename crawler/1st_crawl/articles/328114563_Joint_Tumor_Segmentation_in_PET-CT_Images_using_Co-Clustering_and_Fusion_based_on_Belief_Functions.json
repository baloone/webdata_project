{"id":"328114563_Joint_Tumor_Segmentation_in_PET-CT_Images_using_Co-Clustering_and_Fusion_based_on_Belief_Functions","abstract":"Precise delineation of target tumor is a key factor to ensure the effectiveness of radiation therapy. While hybrid positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) has become a standard imaging tool in the practice of radiation oncology, many existing automatic/semi-automatic methods still perform tumor segmentation on mono-modal images. In this paper, a co-clustering algorithm is proposed to concurrently segment 3-D tumors in PET-CT images, considering that the two complementary imaging modalities can combine functional and anatomical information to improve segmentation performance. The theory of belief functions is adopted in the proposed method to model, fuse, and reason with uncertain and imprecise knowledge from noisy and blurry PET-CT images. To ensure reliable segmentation for each modality, the distance metric for the quantification of clustering distortions and spatial smoothness is iteratively adapted during the clustering procedure. On the other hand, to encourage consistent segmentation between different modalities, a specific context term is proposed in the clustering objective function. Moreover, during the iterative optimization process, clustering results for the two distinct modalities are further adjusted via a belief-functions-based information fusion strategy. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset consisting of twenty-one paired PET-CT images for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our proposed method performs well compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Chunfeng Lian","Su Ruan","Thierry Den≈ìux","Hua
