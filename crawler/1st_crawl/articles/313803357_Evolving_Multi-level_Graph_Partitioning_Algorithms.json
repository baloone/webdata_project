{"id":"313803357_Evolving_Multi-level_Graph_Partitioning_Algorithms","abstract":"Optimal graph partitioning is a foundational problem in computer science, and appears in many different applications. Multi-level graph partitioning is a state-of-the-art method of efficiently approximating high quality graph partitions. In this work, genetic programming techniques are used to evolve new multi-level graph partitioning heuristics that are tailored to specific applications. Results are presented using these evolved partitioners on traditional random graph models as well as a real-world computer network data set. These results demonstrate an improvement in the quality of the partitions produced over current state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Aaron Scott Pope","Daniel R. Tauritz","Alexander D.
