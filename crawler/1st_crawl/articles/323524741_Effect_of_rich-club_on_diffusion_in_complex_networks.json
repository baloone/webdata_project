{"id":"323524741_Effect_of_rich-club_on_diffusion_in_complex_networks","abstract":"One of the main issues in complex networks is the phenomenon of diffusion in which the goal is to find the nodes with the highest diffusing power. In diffusion, there is always a conflict between accuracy and efficiency time complexity; therefore, most of the recent studies have focused on finding new centralities to solve this problem and have offered new ones, but our approach is different. Using one of the complex networks’ features, namely the “rich-club”, its effect on diffusion in complex networks has been analyzed and it is demonstrated that in datasets which have a high rich-club, it is better to use the degree centrality for finding influential nodes because it has a linear time complexity and uses the local information; however, this rule does not apply to datasets which have a low rich-club. Next, real and artificial datasets with the high rich-club have been used in which degree centrality has been compared to famous centrality using the SIR standard.","authors":["Kamal Berahmand","Negin Samadi","Seyed Mahmoud Sheikholeslami"],"meta":["March 2018International Journal of Modern Physics B 32(12):1850142","DOI:10.1142/S0217979218501424"],"references":["316855510_Geometric_explanation_of_the_rich-club_phenomenon_in_complex_networks","316472185_Node_Assortativity_in_Complex_Networks_An_Alternative_Approach","295244368_Evaluating_the_importance_of_nodes_in_complex_networks","275364543_Improving_detection_of_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks","265967139_Correlation_between_centrality_metrics_and_their_application_to_the_opinion_model","313508507_Network_Node_Importance_Measurement_Method_Based_on_Vulnerability_Analysis","305780197_Community_detection_in_networks_A_user_guide","304744011_Vital_nodes_identification_in_complex_networks","285188745_Small_worlds_The_dynamics_of_networks_between_order_and_randomness","261011327_Ranking_the_spreading_influence_in_complex_networks"]}
