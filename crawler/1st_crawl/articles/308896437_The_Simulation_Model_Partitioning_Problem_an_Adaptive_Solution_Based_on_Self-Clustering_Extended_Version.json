{"id":"308896437_The_Simulation_Model_Partitioning_Problem_an_Adaptive_Solution_Based_on_Self-Clustering_Extended_Version","abstract":"This paper is about partitioning in parallel and distributed simulation. That means decomposing the simulation model into a numberof components and to properly allocate them on the execution units. An adaptive solution based on self-clustering, that considers both communication reduction and computational load-balancing, is proposed. The implementation of the proposed mechanism is tested using a simulation model that is challenging both in terms of structure and dynamicity. Various configurations of the simulation model and the execution environment have been considered. The obtained performance results are analyzed using a reference cost model. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is promising and that it can reduce the simulation execution time in both parallel and distributed architectures.","authors":["Gabriele D'Angelo"],"meta":["October 2016Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory 70","DOI:10.1016/j.simpat.2016.10.001"],"references":["263892441_New_trends_in_parallel_and_distributed_simulation_From_many-cores_to_Cloud_Computing","305003254_Tutorial_on_agent-based_modeling_and_simulation","304747650_Efficient_and_effective_clustering_methods_for_spatial_data_mining","285510692_An_algorithm_for_partitioning_and_mapping_conservative_parallel_simulation_onto_minicomputers","283864926_A_self-organizing_virtual_environment_for_agent-based_simulations","278722639_GloMoSim","277670740_CURE","277298615_Partitioning_Parallel_Simulation_Of_Wireless_Networks","261311799_Load_Prediction_in_HLA-Based_Distributed_Simulation_Using_Holt's_Variants","261019771_A_distributed_self-clustering_algorithm_for_autonomous_multi-agent_systems"]}
