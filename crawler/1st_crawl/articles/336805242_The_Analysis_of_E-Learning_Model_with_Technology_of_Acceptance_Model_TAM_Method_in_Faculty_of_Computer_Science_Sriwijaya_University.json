{"id":"336805242_The_Analysis_of_E-Learning_Model_with_Technology_of_Acceptance_Model_TAM_Method_in_Faculty_of_Computer_Science_Sriwijaya_University","abstract":"Sriwijaya University is one of the state universities located on the island of Sumatra, precisely in south Sumatra. It has 10 Faculties, and one of them is faculty of Computer Science (Fasilkom). As one of the best universities with A accreditation, Sriwijaya University always improves the learning system to make it easier for academic community to do teaching and learning process to be more effective and efficient. Therefore, its faculty of Computer Science also applies the learning process using e-learning. That is why we need a method of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to analyze the level of student acceptance of the implementation of e-learning because with the e-learning, lecturers, students and employees in Fasilkom can conduct the learning process more easily and quickly. In addition, with the implementation of e-learning, students and lecturers can do the teaching-learning process without having face-to-face sessions in the classroom. The students can also directly interact and discuss each other in terms of group work.","authors":["Ali Ibrahim","D Cahyani","M M Nursalim","M Arsita"],"meta":["October 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1338(1):012025","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1338/1/012025"],"references":["328576961_Implementing_Customer_Relationship_Management_to_Increase_Education_Service_using_Service_Quality_Method","314130738_Leading_to_Intention_The_Role_of_Attitude_in_Relation_to_Technology_Acceptance_Model_in_E-Learning","289661370_A_cross-cultural_study_of_ICT_competency_attitude_and_satisfaction_of_Turkish_polish_and_Czech_university_students","257718115_Applying_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_to_Online_Learning_in_the_Egyptian_Universities","257171397_Predicting_user_acceptance_of_collaborative_technologies_An_extension_of_the_technology_acceptance_model_for_e-learning","236606388_Understanding_Consumer's_Acceptance_of_Technology-Based_Innovations_in_Retailing","326102718_Modeling_Students'_Perceptions_of_Simulation-Based_Learning_Using_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model","312255281_Determinants_of_intention_to_use_the_mobile_banking_apps_An_extension_of_the_classic_TAM_model","309005658_MLearning_and_pre-service_teachers_An_assessment_of_the_behavioral_intention_using_an_expanded_TAM_model","238004540_Antecedents_and_consequences_of_CRM_technology_acceptance_in_the_sales_force"]}
