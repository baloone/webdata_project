{"id":"349108706_Teacher_Perspectives_on_Teaching_the_STEM_Approach_to_Educational_Coding_and_Robotics_in_Primary_Education","abstract":"An analysis is presented in this study that provides insight into a practical training process\nand its impact on teachers and their viewpoints toward the integrated STEM approach used in that\ntraining process, together with educational coding and robotics, over the first years of compulsory\nprimary education, where STEM implementations are relatively new. A case study was developed\nby two teachers following the practical training course, including pre- and post-interviews and\nnonparticipative observation of their classroom practices during the teacher-training sessions. The\nresults revealed the positive perspectives that the teachers held toward the STEM-integrated approach\nand educational coding and robotics, despite the difficulties that arose in classroom practice. It was\nconcluded that the STEM approach and its methods were beneficial both to pupils and to teachers\nalike for improving the teaching–learning process.","authors":["Christian García-Carrillo","Ileana María Greca","Maria Fernandez-Hawrylak"],"meta":["February 2021Education Sciences 11(64):64","DOI:10.3390/educsci11020064","Project: Robotics and STEM education for children and primary schools - BOTSTEM (2017-1-ES01-KA201-038204)"],"references":["341001427_A_framework_for_epistemological_discussion_around_an_integrated_STEM_education","330371844_Teachers'_perception_of_STEM_integration_and_education_a_systematic_literature_review","329806047_Examining_ways_to_meaningfully_support_students_in_STEM","316490852_IDEAS_EPISTEMOLOGICAS_SOBRE_LA_NATURALEZA_DE_LA_CIENCIA_DE_DOCENTES_EN_FORMACION","315739301_Dificultades_de_maestros_en_formacion_inicial_para_disenar_unidades_didacticas_usando_la_metodologia_de_indagacion","354509997_Infrastructure_of_Comprehensive_STEM_Programming_for_Advanced_Learners","332279831_What_are_we_talking_about_when_we_talk_about_STEM_education_A_review_of_literature","328036113_A_Theoretical_Framework_for_Developing_an_Intercultural_STEAM_Program_for_Australian_and_Korean_Students_to_Enhance_Science_Teaching_and_Learning","326840767_Coding_as_a_Playground_Programming_and_Computational_Thinking_in_the_Early_Childhood_Classroom","313794048_La_robotica_como_un_recurso_para_facilitar_el_aprendizaje_y_desarrollo_de_competencias_generales"]}
