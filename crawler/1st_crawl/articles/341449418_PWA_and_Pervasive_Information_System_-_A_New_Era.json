{"id":"341449418_PWA_and_Pervasive_Information_System_-_A_New_Era","abstract":"Nowadays, and increasingly, the usersâ€™ demand over the applications requires them to be a lot more flexible, adaptable, capable of being executed over different operational systems. This happens according to the need of accessing those applications no matter where, when, nor what they use to do so. Well, this is the basis under the concept of Pervasive Information Systems (PIS). But, how can such complex thematic be handled? How can an application be developed towards global usage? A new development methodology has been arising, Progressive Web Application (PWA), by mixing the web pages with the mobile applications world. So, in a nutshell, PWAs appear as a concretization of what is PIS concept. This article aims to explore this thematic and provide a few insights on what is PWA, what are its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.","authors":["Gisela Fernandes","Filipe Portela","Manuel Filipe Santos"],"meta":["May 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-45697-9_33","In book: Trends and Innovations in Information Systems and Technologies (pp.334-343)"],"references":["330834334_Impact_of_Progressive_Web_Apps_on_Web_App_Development","309127964_Big_Data_Analytics_Platforms_for_Real-Time_Applications_in_IoT","241148741_Model-Driven_Methodologies_for_Pervasive_Information_Systems_Development","221353889_A_Design_Theory_for_Pervasive_Information_Systems","37616573_Modeling_Context_Information_in_Pervasive_Computing_Systems","4322640_Pervasive_computing_Past_present_and_future","332086291_Software_Development_for_Mobile_Computing_the_Internet_of_Things_and_Wearable_Devices_Inspecting_the_Past_to_Understand_the_Future","323380596_Progressive_Web_Apps_the_Definite_Approach_to_Cross-Platform_Development","286934854_Context-Dependent_Testing_of_Applications_for_Mobile_Devices","237393853_PRINCIPLES_OF_BUSINESS_INFORMATION_SYSTEMS"]}
