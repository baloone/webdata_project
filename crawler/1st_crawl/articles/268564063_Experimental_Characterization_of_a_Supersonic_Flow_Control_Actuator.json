{"id":"268564063_Experimental_Characterization_of_a_Supersonic_Flow_Control_Actuator","abstract":"Computational and experimental techniques are being used to investigate the operating characteristics of a promising cavity device for high-speed flow control called the SparkJet actuator. This actuator, which produces a synthetic jet with high exhaust velocities, holds the promise of manipulating supersonic boundary layers without active mechanical components. This paper focuses on the experimental characterization of a newly-redesigned SparkJet. Numerical parametric studies of the previous design characterized the performance attributes of the device as a function of orifice size, chamber volume, and energy deposited. Current experimental efforts to assess the new mm-scale actuator design include the application of high-resolution particle image velocimetry to quantify quiescent air operation, and the use of a miniaturized thrust stand to measure SparkJet impulse bit data and to determine an optimal duty cycle. Both data sets will also be used to calibrate the computations and to determine a confidence level in the prediction capability.","authors":["Bohdan Cybyk","H Land","Daniel Simon","Jun Chen"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.2514/6.2006-478","Conference: 44th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit"],"references":["269068079_Microactuator_arrays_for_sublayer_control_in_turbulent_boundary_layers_using_the_electrokinetic_principle","234933841_Pulse_Thrust_Measurements_using_Laser_Interferometry","268567512_The_Structure_of_a_Pulsed_Jet_-_A_PIV_Study","268561318_Flow_Control_Research_and_Applications_at_the_AFRL's_Air_Vehicles_Directorate","260256699_Nonlinear_Aspects_of_Hypersonic_Boundary-Layer_Stability_on_a_Porous_Surface","252661122_Drag_and_lift_forces_on_microscopic_bubbles_entrained_by_a_vortex","252405912_Measurements_of_the_flow_structure_and_turbulence_within_a_ship_bow_wave","241243223_Overview_of_Active_Flow_Control_at_NASA_Langley_Research_Center","234385982_Combustion-Driven_Jet_Actuators_for_Flow_Control","231963881_Experiments_on_the_stability_of_supersonic_laminar_boundary_layers","231086453_Five_techniques_for_increasing_the_speed_and_accuracy_of_PIV_interrogation","228467747_Prevention_of_Nozzle_Wear_in_Abrasive_Water_Suspension_Jets_AWSJ_Using_Porous_Lubricated_Nozzles"]}
