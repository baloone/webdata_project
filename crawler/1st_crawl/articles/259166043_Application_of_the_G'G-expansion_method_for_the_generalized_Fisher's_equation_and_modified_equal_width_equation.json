{"id":"259166043_Application_of_the_G'G-expansion_method_for_the_generalized_Fisher's_equation_and_modified_equal_width_equation","abstract":"In this work, the exact traveling wave solutions of the generalized Fisher’s equation and modified equal width equation are studied by using the G′G-expansion method. As a result, many solitary wave solutions are derived from the solutions via hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions and rational functions. When the parameters were taken at special values, the results obtained were compared with the solution via the tanh method established earlier. In fact, many general non-traveling wave solutions are obtained. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by applying it for a variety of selected equations.","authors":["Wafaa M. Taha","M.S.M.
