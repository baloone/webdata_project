{"id":"329016792_A_modified_algorithm_for_improving_lifetime_in_WSN","abstract":"In recent years, the utilization of wireless sensor systems for modern applications has been quickly developing and wireless devices are for the most part battery worked devices which have restricted battery control. Since sensor hops are little in estimate, cost-productive, low control devices, and have constrained battery control supply. Remote Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used for a remote workplace, once sending is done; it isn't conceivable to supplant the battery and vitality. And this paper also proposed a hybrid calculation algorithm which identifies with the system lifetime upgrade. The results have calculated by using NS2 programming show that the proposed algorithm has a considerable change as compared to previous algorithms","authors":["Ibrahim Osamah","Osamah Ibrahem Khalaf","Ghaidaa Muttasher Abdulsaheb","Muayed Sadik"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences 13(21):9277-9282","DOI:10.3923/jeasci.2018.9277.9282"],"references":[]}
