{"id":"320186493_Metaliteracy_as_Pedagogical_Framework_for_Learner-Centered_Design_in_Three_MOOC_Platforms_Connectivist_Coursera_and_Canvas","abstract":"This article examines metaliteracy as a pedagogical model that leverages the assets of MOOC platforms to enhance self-regulated and self-empowered learning. Between 2013 and 2015, a collaborative teaching team within the State University of New York (SUNY) developed three MOOCs on three different platforms—connectivist, Coursera and Canvas—to engage with learners about metaliteracy. As a reframing of information literacy, metaliteracy envisions the learner as an active and metacognitive producer of digital information in online communities and social media environments (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; 2014). This team of educators, which constitutes the core of the Metaliteracy Learning Collaborative, used metaliteracy as a lens for applied teaching and learning strategies in the development of a cMOOC and two xMOOCs. The metaliteracy MOOCs pushed against the dominant trends of lecture-based, automated MOOC design towards a more learner-centered pedagogy that aligns with key components of metaliteracy.","authors":["Kelsey Lynne O'Brien","Michele Forte","Thomas P Mackey","Trudi Jacobson"],"meta":["September 2017Open Praxis 9(3):267","DOI:10.5944/openpraxis.9.3.553"],"references":["305602116_A_Taxonomy_of_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","304627020_From_massive_access_to_cooperation_lessons_learned_and_proven_results_of_a_hybrid_xMOOCcMOOC_pedagogical_approach_to_MOOCs","285747281_Theories_and_Applications_of_Massive_Online_Open_Courses_MOOCs_The_Case_for_Hybrid_Design","282328752_The_Forum_Community_the_Connectivist_Element_of_an_xMOOC","345894195_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_MOOC_Massive_Open_Online_Course_Platforms","345809397_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOCs_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_the_Main_Platforms","292709114_Metaliteracy_Reinventing_Information_Literacy_to_Empower_Learners","287360117_Learning_in_MOOCs_Motivations_and_self-regulated_learning_in_MOOCs","276957257_Technobiophilia_nature_and_cyberspace","274731602_Massive_open_online_courses_MOOCs_Insights_and_challenges_from_a_psychological_perspective"]}
