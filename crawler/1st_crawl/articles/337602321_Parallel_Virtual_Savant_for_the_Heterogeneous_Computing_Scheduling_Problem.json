{"id":"337602321_Parallel_Virtual_Savant_for_the_Heterogeneous_Computing_Scheduling_Problem","abstract":"We present in this work the first parallel implementation of Virtual Savant (VS), a novel optimization method that is able to quickly generate pseudo-optimal solutions to a given combinatorial problem, thanks to its parallel pattern recognition engine. The proposed parallel implementation does not require any information exchange between the threads during the run, they just get/send the required information before/after the execution. This design allows for a flexible algorithm that can perform efficiently on both shared- and distributed-memory systems. Our implementation uses both OpenMP for parallel architectures and MPI for distributed environments, which can efficiently make use of both kind of systems. The performance of VS is extensively analyzed on four different computing infrastructures, varying the number of threads used on each considered architecture. In addition, we propose a simulator to accurately predict the performance of VS on any parallel system. Experimental results show that VS is able to make an efficient use of the available computing resources, showing good scalability properties on all studied architectures.","authors":["Juan Carlos de la Torre Mac√≠as","Renzo Massobrio","Patricia Ruiz","Sergio Nesmachnow"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Computational Science 39:101048","DOI:10.1016/j.jocs.2019.101048","Project: SAVANT: Automatic Generation of Parallel Approximation Algorithms for Low-power Architectures Based on Machine Learning"],"references":["329067346_Virtual_Savant_for_the_Heterogeneous_Computing_Scheduling_Problem","321851817_The_Virtual_Savant_Automatic_Generation_of_Parallel_Solvers","319600563_MiCOMP_Mitigating_the_Compiler_Phase-Ordering_Problem_Using_Optimization_Sub-Sequences_and_Machine_Learning","318575279_Combining_Machine_Learning_and_Genetic_Algorithms_to_Solve_the_Independent_Tasks_Scheduling_Problem","304231991_Savant_Automatic_generation_of_a_parallel_scheduling_heuristic_for_map-reduce","276338149_A_parallel_local_search_in_CPUGPU_for_scheduling_independent_tasks_on_large_heterogeneous_computing_systems","220176005_Heterogeneous_computing_scheduling_with_evolutionary_algorithms","26293542_The_savant_syndrome_An_extraordinary_condition_A_synopsis_Past_present_future","329475599_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_Via_the_Lasso","319209744_Solving_a_New_3D_Bin_Packing_Problem_with_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Method","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","287104147_Predictive_Inference","278048614_Pointer_Networks","265129858_A_Hierarchical_Approach_for_Energy-efficient_Scheduling_of_Large_Workloads_in_Multicore_Distributed_Systems","222510982_A_Comparison_of_Eleven_Static_Heuristics_for_Mapping_a_Class_of_Independent_Tasks_onto_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Computing_Systems","222417496_A_revisit_of_fast_greedy_heuristics_for_mapping_a_class_of_independent_tasks_onto_heterogeneous_computing_systems","220199980_A_parallel_micro_evolutionary_algorithm_for_heterogeneous_computing_and_grid_scheduling","31776393_Extraordinary_People_Understanding_Savant_Syndrome_DA_Treffert","2954214_Heterogeneous_Computing_Challenges_and_Opportunities"]}
