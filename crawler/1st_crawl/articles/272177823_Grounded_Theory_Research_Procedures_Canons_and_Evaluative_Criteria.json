{"id":"272177823_Grounded_Theory_Research_Procedures_Canons_and_Evaluative_Criteria","abstract":"Using grounded theory as an example, this paper examines three methodological questions that are generally applicable to all qualitative methods. How should the usual scientific canons be reinterpreted for qualitative research? How should researchers report the procedures and canons used in their research? What evaluative criteria should be used in judging the research products? The basic argument we propose is that the criteria should be adapted to fit the procedures of the method. We demonstrate how we have done this with grounded theory and suggest criteria for evaluating studies done in this mode. We suggest that other qualitative researchers might be similarly specific about their procedures and evaluative criteria.","authors":["Juliet Corbin","Anselm Strauss"],"meta":["December 1990Zeitschrift f√ºr Soziologie 19(6)","DOI:10.1515/zfsoz-1990-0602"],"references":["345685118_Social_Organization_of_Medical_Work","319393294_Logic_of_Scientific_Discovery","313181264_The_Grounded_Theory_Method_An_Explication_and_Interpretation","313091138_Introduction_to_the_science_of_sociology","297147287_Problems_of_reliability_and_validity_in_ethnographic_research","279187301_Mind_Self_and_Society","275693943_Field_Research_A_Source-Book_and_Field_Manual","273052936_Reliability_and_Validity_in_Qualitative_Research","270195804_Sociological_Work_Method_and_Substance","270162336_In_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","270012493_Speaking_of_Ethnography","264988648_An_Emerging_Field_of_Research","249165960_Science_Without_Concepts","246718957_Logik_Der_Forschung_The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discovery","235362971_The_Basics_of_Qualitative_Research","42800634_Ethnography_Principles_In_Practice","19804872_Approaches_to_Nursing_Science_Methods","13017844_Technology_As_an_Occasion_for_Structuring_Evidence_from_Observations_of_CT_Scanners_and_the_Social_Order_of_Radiology_Departments"]}
