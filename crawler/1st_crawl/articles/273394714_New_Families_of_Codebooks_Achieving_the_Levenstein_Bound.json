{"id":"273394714_New_Families_of_Codebooks_Achieving_the_Levenstein_Bound","abstract":"In this paper, a construction of codebooks based on a set of bent functions satisfying certain conditions is introduced. It includes some earlier constructions of codebooks meeting the Levenstein bound as special cases. With this construction, two new families of codebooks achieving the Levenstein bound are obtained. The codebooks constructed in this paper could have a very small alphabet size.","authors":["Zhengchun Zhou","Cunsheng Ding","Nian Li"],"meta":["November 2014IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 60(11):7382-7387","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2014.2353052"],"references":["280445306_Packing_Lines_Planes_etc_Packings_in_Grassmannian_Space","260800751_Deterministic_Sensing_Matrices_Arising_From_Near_Orthogonal_Systems","239062924_Z4-Kerdock_Codes_Orthogonal_Spreads_and_Extremal_Euclidean_Line-Sets","236589369_Optimal_Ternary_Cyclic_Codes_From_Monomials","222565757_Grassmannian_Frames_with_Applications_to_Coding_and_Communication","220686002_Constructions_of_Quadratic_Bent_Functions_in_Polynomial_Forms","220680664_New_Family_of_p_-ary_Sequences_With_Optimal_Correlation_Property_and_Large_Linear_Span","3085823_Compressed_Sensing","3078434_Binary_sequences_with_Gold-like_correlation_but_larger_linear_span","2242859_Welch's_Bound_and_Sequence_Sets_for_Code-Division_Multiple-Access_Systems","285380039_Bounds_for_Packings_on_a_Sphere_and_in_Space","285296495_Packing_in_grassmannian_spaces","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","266224603_Bounds_for_packings_of_metric_spaces_and_some_of_their_applications","264791605_New_Constructions_of_Quadratic_Bent_Functions_in_Polynomial_Form","262416938_Near-Optimal_Partial_Hadamard_Codebook_Construction_Using_Binary_Sequences_Obtained_From_Quadratic_Residue_Mapping","260712444_New_Constructions_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound_With_Equality","257555028_A_new_class_of_near-optimal_partial_Fourier_codebooks_from_an_almost_difference_set","256391988_On_bent_functions","254061567_A_Construction_of_Codebooks_Associated_With_Binary_Sequences","254056958_Two_Classes_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","239443806_Bounds_for_packing_on_a_sphere_and_in_space","222863869_Generalized_Bent_Functions_and_Their_Properties","222468090_Optimal_state-determination_by_mutually_unbiased_measurements","220679750_Two_New_Families_of_Optimal_Binary_Sequences_Obtained_From_Quaternary_Sequences","220638133_Construction_of_cyclotomic_codebooks_nearly_meeting_the_Welch_bound","200524207_An_Introduction_to_Frames_and_Riesz_Bases","46588039_Steiner_equiangular_tight_frames","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes","3162278_Signal_Sets_From_Functions_With_Optimum_Nonlinearity","3086571_A_Generic_Construction_of_Complex_Codebooks_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound","3085998_Complex_Codebooks_From_Combinatorial_Designs","3085640_Decoding_by_Linear_Programming","3085429_Achieving_the_Welch_Bound_With_Difference_Sets","3084872_New_Families_of_Binary_Sequences_with_Low_Correlation","3082399_Lower_bounds_on_the_maximum_cross_correlation_of_signals_Corresp","3080833_New_nonbinary_sequences_with_ideal_two-level_autocorrelation","2670177_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound_with_Equality"]}
