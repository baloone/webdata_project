{"id":"321210791_Receptive_Field_Block_Net_for_Accurate_and_Fast_Object_Detection","abstract":"Current top-performing object detectors depend on deep CNN backbones, such as ResNet-101 and Inception, benefiting from their powerful feature representation but suffering from high computational cost. Conversely, some lightweight model based detectors fulfil real time processing, while their accuracies are often criticized. In this paper, we explore an alternative to build a fast and accurate detector by strengthening lightweight features using a crafting mechanism. Inspired by the structure of Receptive Fields (RFs) in human visual systems, we propose a novel RF Block (RFB) module, which takes the relationship between the size and eccentricity of RFs into account, to enhance the discriminability and robustness of features. We further assemble the RFB module to the top of SSD with a lightweight CNN model, constructing the RFB Net detector. To evaluate its effectiveness, experiments are conducted on two major benchmarks and the results show that RFB Net is able to reach the accuracy of advanced very deep backbone network based detectors while keeping the real-time speed. Code will be make publicly available soon.","authors":["Songtao Liu","di Huang","Yunhong Wang"],"meta":["November 2017","Project: Receptive Field Block Net for Accurate and Fast Object Detection"],"references":["319035939_BlitzNet_A_Real-Time_Deep_Network_for_Scene_Understanding","319035683_CoupleNet_Coupling_Global_Structure_with_Local_Parts_for_Object_Detection","318899558_DSOD_Learning_Deeply_Supervised_Object_Detectors_from_Scratch","316184205_MobileNets_Efficient_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Mobile_Vision_Applications","313744147_Discriminative_learning_of_local_image_descriptors","312759848_DSSD_Deconvolutional_Single_Shot_Detector","311223153_Speedaccuracy_trade-offs_for_modern_convolutional_object_detectors","307302911_PVANET_Deep_but_Lightweight_Neural_Networks_for_Real-time_Object_Detection","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","286513835_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","262270555_Selective_Search_for_Object_Recognition","220659463_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_VOC_challenge","37463816_A_fast_local_descriptor_for_dense_matching","4260096_Learning_Local_Image_Descriptors","326566753_Focal_Loss_for_Dense_Object_Detection","322060558_Deformable_Convolutional_Networks","320971842_Fully_Convolutional_Instance-Aware_Semantic_Segmentation","320971779_Finding_Tiny_Faces","320967941_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_Stronger","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","318205093_ShuffleNet_An_Extremely_Efficient_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Mobile_Devices","317679203_Rethinking_Atrous_Convolution_for_Semantic_Image_Segmentation","315454672_Mask_R-CNN","312461699_Understanding_the_Effective_Receptive_Field_in_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","311573567_Feature_Pyramid_Networks_for_Object_Detection","310441005_Aggregated_Residual_Transformations_for_Deep_Neural_Networks","303812083_DeepLab_Semantic_Image_Segmentation_with_Deep_Convolutional_Nets_Atrous_Convolution_and_Fully_Connected_CRFs","303409473_R-FCN_Object_Detection_via_Region-based_Fully_Convolutional_Networks","301875889_A_MultiPath_Network_for_Object_Detection","301874967_Inception-v4_Inception-ResNet_and_the_Impact_of_Residual_Connections_on_Learning","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","285648386_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","278049038_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","275669302_Fast_r-cnn","274514369_Computational_neuroimaging_and_population_receptive_fields","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","263813716_Learning_Local_Feature_Descriptors_Using_Convex_Optimisation","263002356_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","221363206_A_Discriminatively_Trained_Multiscale_Deformable_Part_Model"]}
