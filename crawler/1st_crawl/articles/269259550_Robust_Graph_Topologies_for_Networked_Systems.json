{"id":"269259550_Robust_Graph_Topologies_for_Networked_Systems","abstract":"Robustness of networked systems against noise corruption and structural changes in an underlying network topology is a critical issue for a reliable performance. In this paper, we investigate this issue of robustness in networked systems both from structural and functional viewpoints. Structural robustness deals with the effect of changes in a graph structure due to link or edge failures, while functional robustness addresses how well a system behaves in the presence of noise. We discuss that both of these aspects are inter-related, and can be measured through a common graph invariant. A graph process is introduced where edges are added to an existing graph in a step-wise manner to maximize robustness. Moreover, a relationship between the symmetry of an underlying network structure and robustness is also discussed.","authors":["Waseem toori Abbas"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.3182/20120914-2-US-4030.00052","Conference: Engine and Powertrain Control, Simulation and Modeling"],"references":["261194069_Rearranging_trees_for_robust_consensus","227140153_The_Electrical_Resistance_Of_A_Graph_Captures_Its_Commute_And_Cover_Times","226420782_Resistance_Distance","222838414_Effective_graph_resistance","220509208_Spectral_Measure_of_Structural_Robustness_in_Complex_Networks","225448324_Robustness_analysis_of_leader-follower_consensus"]}
