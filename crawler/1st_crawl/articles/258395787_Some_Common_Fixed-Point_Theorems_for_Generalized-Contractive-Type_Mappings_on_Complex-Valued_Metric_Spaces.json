{"id":"258395787_Some_Common_Fixed-Point_Theorems_for_Generalized-Contractive-Type_Mappings_on_Complex-Valued_Metric_Spaces","abstract":"Fixed-point theory in complex valued metric spaces has greatly developed in\nrecent times. In this paper, we prove certain common fixed-point theorems for two single-valued mappings in such spaces. The mappings we consider here are assumed to satisfy certain metric inequalities with generalized fixed-point theorems due to Rouzkard and Imdad (2012). This extends and subsumes many results of other authors which were obtained for mappings on complex-valued metric spaces.","authors":["Chakkrid Klin-eam","Cholatis Suanoom"],"meta":["January 2013Abstract and Applied Analysis 2013(8)","DOI:10.1155/2013/604215"],"references":["267437059_Common_fixed_point_theorems_using_property_EA_in_complex-valued_metric_spaces","233793879_Generalized_common_fixed_point_theorems_in_complex_valued_metric_spaces_and_applications","268422971_A_COMMON_FIXED_POINT_THEOREM_FOR_FOUR_SELF_MAPS_IN_COMPLEX_VALUED_AND_VECTOR_VALUED_METRIC_SPACES","257313142_Some_common_fixed_point_theorems_on_complex_valued_metric_spaces","243450076_Sur_les_Oprations_dans_les_Ensembles_Abstraits_et_leurs_Applications_aux_Equations_Intgrales","232998431_Common_Fixed_Point_Theorems_in_Complex_Valued_Metric_Spaces"]}
