{"id":"345762717_Teaching_coding_as_a_literacy_Issues_challenges_and_limitations","abstract":"The concept of coding as a literacy is based on the fact that computer codes are fundamentally languages. Because literacy is about reading and writing, teaching coding can be viewed as teaching how to read and write in a language for machines. This view broadens the pedagogical scope of computer programming and opens opportunities for learning to those who might not conventionally be engaged in coding in its current presentation. Teaching coding as a literacy also encourages the adoption of well-established strategies based on the developmental processes of literacy in natural languages in teaching and learning coding.\nAlthough this view is sensible and certainly promising, there are important issues that need to be considered, primarily the consequences of requiring a specific language in teaching literacy. Nevertheless, the fields of computer science, engineering, linguistics, and literacy education have much to contribute collectively towards ensuring that the future generation is literate in the language of their eventual workspaces.","authors":["Alvin Vista"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.20935/AL5"],"references":["322993437_THE_NORDIC_APPROACH_TO_INTRODUCING_COMPUTATIONAL_THINKING_AND_PROGRAMMING_IN_COMPULSORY_EDUCATION","274309848_Computational_Thinking","38036684_The_Myth_of_Language_Universals_Language_Diversity_and_Its_Importance_for_Cognitive_Science","38011789_An_Anatomical_Signature_for_Literacy","295134892_Understanding_Computer_Programming_as_a_Literacy","231858158_Research_Perspectives_on_Teaching_English_as_a_Lingua_Franca"]}
