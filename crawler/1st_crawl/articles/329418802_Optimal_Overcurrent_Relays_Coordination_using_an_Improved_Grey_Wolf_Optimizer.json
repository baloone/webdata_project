{"id":"329418802_Optimal_Overcurrent_Relays_Coordination_using_an_Improved_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer","abstract":"Recently, nature inspired algorithms (NIA) have been implemented to various fields of optimization problems. In this paper, the implementation of NIA is reported to solve the overcurrent relay coordination problem. The purpose is to find the optimal value of the Time Multiplier Setting (TMS) and Plug Setting (PS) in order to minimize the primary relays' operating time at the near end fault. The optimization is performed using the Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO) algorithm. Some modifications to the original GWO have been made to improve the candidate's exploration ability. Comprehensive simulation studies have been performed to demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed modification technique compared to the conventional GWO and some well-known algorithms. The generated results have confirmed the proposed IGWO is able to optimize the objective function of the overcurrent relay coordination problem.
