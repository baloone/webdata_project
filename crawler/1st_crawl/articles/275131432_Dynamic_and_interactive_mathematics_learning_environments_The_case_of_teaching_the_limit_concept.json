{"id":"275131432_Dynamic_and_interactive_mathematics_learning_environments_The_case_of_teaching_the_limit_concept","abstract":"This theoretical study is an attempt to explore the potential of the dynamic and interactive mathematics learning environments\n(DIMLE) in relation to the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. DIMLE are developed with intent\nto support learning mathematics through free exploration in a less constrained environment. A typical DIMLE software package\nhas interactivity and dynamism as key affordances; these are especially suitable for enhancing learning and teaching with\ntechnology of the essentially dynamic mathematics concepts. Moreover, we propose that DIMLE and their affordances should be\nstudied under the TPACK framework because this framework is explicit in considering technology-supported mathematics learning\nas a qualitative add-on as contrasted to what would be a simple totalling of technological, pedagogical and mathematical knowledge.\nAs an example, we focus in our discussion on using a DIMLE in order to support learner in development of the limit concept.","authors":["Dragana Martinovic","Zekeriya Karadag"],"meta":["March 2012Teaching Mathematics and its Applications 31(1):41-48","DOI:10.1093/teamat/hrr029"],"references":["250895947_To_be_or_to_become_How_dynamic_geometry_changes_discourse","226924818_The_Psychology_of_Advanced_Mathematical_Thinking"]}
