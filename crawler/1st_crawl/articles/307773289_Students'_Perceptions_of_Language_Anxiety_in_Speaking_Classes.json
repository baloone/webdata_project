What makes language learning environments, particularly English language learning situations, anxiety provoking has been well-established in language anxiety literature and the learners’ perception of language anxiety deserve a special mention as they are one of the parties directly involved in learning process.

Through a purposive sampling procedure, 30 students from different proficiency levels were interviewed. Findings from the semi-structured interviews are discussed with reference to learners’ perceptions of learning English. Possible sources and manifestations of language anxiety from the learners’ perspectives are examined and their suggested ways to lower language anxiety are discussed.","authors":["Mustafa Naci Kayaoğlu","Hasan Sağlamel"],"meta":["July 2013Journal of History Culture and Art Research 2(2)","DOI:10.7596/taksad.v2i2.245"],"references":["293263722_Investigation_of_the_factors_that_cause_language_anxiety_for_ESLEFL_learners_in_learning_speaking_skills_and_the_influence_it_casts_on_communication_in_the_target_language","274704221_Test_Anxiety_among_Foreign_Language_Learners_A_Review_of_Literature","258182758_Anxiety_and_Speaking_English_as_a_Second_Language","264874453_Language_Anxiety_from_the_Teacher's_Perspective_Interviews_with_Seven_Experienced_ESLEFL_Teachers","263588303_Examination_of_Horwitz_Horwitz_and_Cope's_Construct_of_Foreign_Language_Anxiety_The_Case_of_Students_of_Japanese","263501160_Foreign_Language_Classroom_Anxiety","263061050_Foreign_Language_Learning_Differences_Affective_or_Native_Language_Aptitude_Differences","263061033_On_Seeing_the_Forest_and_the_Trees_A_Rejoinder_to_Sparks_and_Ganschow","262904184_Cognition_Plus_Correlates_Of_Language_Learning_Success","249797725_Correlates_Causes_Effects_and_Treatment_of_Test_Anxiety"]}
