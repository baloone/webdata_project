{"id":"232252940_Wireless_Network_Stability_in_the_SINR_Model","abstract":"We study the stability of wireless networks under stochastic arrival\nprocesses of packets, and design efficient, distributed algorithms that achieve\nstability in the SINR (Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio) interference\nmodel.\nSpecifically, we make the following contributions. We give a distributed\nalgorithm that achieves $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\log^2 n})$-efficiency on all networks\n(where $n$ is the number of links in the network), for all length monotone,\nsub-linear power assignments. For the power control version of the problem, we\ngive a distributed algorithm with $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\log n(\\log n + \\log \\log\n\\Delta)})$-efficiency (where $\\Delta$ is the length diversity of the link set).","authors":["Eyjólfur Ingi Ásgeirsson","Magnús M.
