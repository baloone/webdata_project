{"id":"329163997_Injective_Chromatic_Number_of_Outerplanar_Graphs","abstract":"An injective coloring of a graph is a vertex coloring where two vertices with common neighbor receive distinct colors. The minimum integer k such that G has a k-injective coloring is called injective chromatic number of G and denoted by χ i (G). In this paper, the injective chromatic number of outerplanar graphs with maximum degree ∆ and girth g is studied. It is shown that every outerplanar graph G has χ i (G) ≤ ∆ + 2, and this bound is tight. Then, it is proved that for an outerplanar graph G with ∆ = 3, χ i (G) ≤ ∆ + 1 and the bound is tight for outerplanar graphs of girth 3 and 4. Finally, it is proved that, the injective chromatic number of 2-connected outerplanar graphs with ∆ = 3, g ≥ 6 and ∆ ≥ 4, g ≥ 4 is equal to ∆.","authors":["Mahsa Mozafari-Nia","Mahsa Mozafari Nia"],"meta":["December 2018Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics 22:1309-1320","Project: Injective coloring of graphs"],"references":["320035828_Injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_6","271832902_Counterexamples_to_a_conjecture_on_injective_colorings","249643615_Note_on_planar_graphs_with_largest_injective_chromatic_numbers","257000969_List_injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_5_6_8","257000679_Injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs","256694183_Colorings_of_plane_graphs_A_survey","248830621_Coloring_graph_vertices_in_prescribed_colors","244428355_Graphs_with_Given_Diameter_and_a_Coloring_Problem","238202527_Coloring_the_square_of_an_outerplanar_graph","226115143_Injective_D_1-coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_6"]}
