{"id":"227310237_Numeration_Systems_on_a_Regular_Language","abstract":"Generalizations of positional number systems in which N is recognizable by finite automata are obtained by describing an\narbitrary infinite regular language according to the lexicographic ordering. For these systems of numeration, we show that\nultimately periodic sets are recognizable. We also study translation and multiplication by constants as well as the order-dependence\nof the recognizability.","authors":["Pierre Lecomte","Michel Rigo"],"meta":["December 2000Theory of Computing Systems 34(1):27-44","DOI:10.1007/s002240010014"],"references":["274228062_A_Course_in_Number_Theory","270310911_The_Higher_Arithmetic","266405784_On_representation_of_integers_in_linear_numeration_systems","266221956_b-shift_numeration_systems_and_automata","264929373_Systems_of_Numeration","246679251_Les_s'eries_rationnelles_et_leurs_langages","245700512_Comment_ecrire_les_nombres_entiers_dans_une_base_qui_n'est_pas_entiere","241636526_Systems_of_numeration","226399880_On_the_CobhamSemenov_Theorem","225865226_Uniform_Tag_Seqences"]}
