{"id":"225508617_Development_and_Use_of_the_ARCS_Model_of_Instructional_Design","abstract":"The ARCS Model of motivation was developed in response to a desire to find more effective ways of understanding the major\ninfluences on the motivation to learn, and for systematic ways of identifying and solving problems with learning motivation.\nThe resulting model contains a four category synthesis of variables that encompasses most of the areas of research on human\nmotivation, and a motivational design process that is compatible with typical instructional design models. Following its development,\nthe ARCS Model was field tested in two inservice teacher education programs. Based on the results of these field tests, the\nARCS Model appears to provide useful assistance to designers and teachers, and warrants more controlled studies of its critical\nattributes and areas of effectiveness.","authors":["John M.
