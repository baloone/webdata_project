{"id":"236578584_Sophistication_vs_Logical_Depth","abstract":"Sophistication and logical depth are two measures that express how\ncomplicated the structure in a string is. Sophistication is defined as the\nminimal complexity of a computable function that defines a two-part description\nfor the string that is shortest within some precision; the second can be\ndefined as the minimal computation time of a program that is shortest within\nsome precision. We show that the Busy Beaver function of the sophistication of\na string exceeds its logical depth with logarithmically bigger precision, and\nthat logical depth exceeds the Busy Beaver function of sophistication with\nlogarithmically bigger precision. We also show that this is not true if the\nprecision is only increased by a constant (when the notions are defined with\nplain Kolmogorov complexity). Finally we show that sophistication is unstable\nin its precision: constant variations can change its value by a linear term in\nthe length of the string.","authors":["Luís Antunes","Bruno Bauwens","André Souto","Andreia Teixeira"],"meta":["February 2017Theory of Computing Systems","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9672-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319393405_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","305040438_The_concept_of_a_b-stochasticity_in_the_Kolmogorov_sense_and_its_properties","292334872_Computability_in_statistical_hypotheses_testing_and_characterizations_of_independence_and_directed_influences_in_time_series_using_Kolmogorov_complexity","322622477_Information_measures_effective_complexity_and_total_information","316805467_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","309310624_Three_approaches_to_the_quantitative_definition_of_information","274891554_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_New-York","266013140_Complexity_depth_and_sophistication","265507184_On_Algorithmic_Strong_Sufficient_Statistics","265477325_Effective_Complexity","264738719_What_is_complexity_Remarks_on_simplicity_and_complexity_by_the_Nobel_Prize-winning_author_of_The_Quark_and_the_Jaguar","248717154_Complexity_of_Algorithms_and_Objective_Definition_of_Randomness","243100595_On_the_Defect_of_Randomness_of_a_Finite_Object_with_Respect_to_Measures_with_Given_Complexity_Bounds","238651290_A_formal_theory_of_inductive_inference_I","237135396_Information_measures_effective_complexity_and_total_information"]}
