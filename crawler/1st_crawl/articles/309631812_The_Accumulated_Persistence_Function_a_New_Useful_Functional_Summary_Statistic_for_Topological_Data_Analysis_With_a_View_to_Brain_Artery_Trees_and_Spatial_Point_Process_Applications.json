{"id":"309631812_The_Accumulated_Persistence_Function_a_New_Useful_Functional_Summary_Statistic_for_Topological_Data_Analysis_With_a_View_to_Brain_Artery_Trees_and_Spatial_Point_Process_Applications","abstract":"A persistent diagram is a multiset of points in the plane describing the persistence of topological features of a compact set when a scale parameter varies. Since statistical methods are difficult to apply directly on persistence diagrams, various alternative functional summary statistics have been suggested, but either they do not contain the full information of the persistence diagram or they are two-dimensional functions. This paper suggests a new functional summary statistic that is one-dimensional and hence easier to handle, and which under mild conditions contains the full information of the persistence diagram. Its usefulness is illustrated in various statistical settings concerned with point clouds and brain artery trees.","authors":["Christophe A.N.
