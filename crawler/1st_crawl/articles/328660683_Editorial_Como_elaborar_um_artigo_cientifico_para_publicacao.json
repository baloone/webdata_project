{"id":"328660683_Editorial_Como_elaborar_um_artigo_cientifico_para_publicacao","abstract":"Scientific production has never been as thoroughly examined/debated as nowadays.\n\nIn the era of Computer Science and of shared information, the proliferation of scientific magazines online leads to a double control carried out on publications. We mustnâ€™t neglect that the credibility of in line magazines is directly related to the quality and originality of the published scientific articles. On the other hand, there is a wider control over an article before it is published, checking thoroughly if it shows no plagiarism. The double-blind peer review becomes essential when allowing a scrutiny and the validation of the scientific articles intended to be published. To write an essay requires knowledge and appropriate techniques, otherwise we will not be producing a scientific article but a mere opinion piece. Throughout this editorial we draw some guidelines that could lead our readers, probable authors in the future, to an improvement in their research, writing and after publication.","authors":["Armando Dias Ramos"],"meta":["October 2018Revista Brasileira de Direito Processual Penal 4(3):921","DOI:10.22197/rbdpp.v4i3.192"],"references":["319660866_PRESENTACION_DEL_PROBLEMA_BAJO_UNA_METODOLOGIA_REFLEXIVA_PARA_LA_INVESTIGACION_CIENTIFICA","277302837_How_To_Write_Backwards","315998070_A_pesquisa_no_ensino_superior_um_ensaio_sobre_metodologia_cientifica","287899789_Metodo_Juridico_e_Interpretacao_do_Direito_Reflexoes_Programaticas_sobre_a_Concretizacao_dos_Direitos_Coletivos","278405327_Manual_de_investigacao_em_ciencias_sociais_trajectos","236144141_The_art_of_Case_Study_Research"]}
