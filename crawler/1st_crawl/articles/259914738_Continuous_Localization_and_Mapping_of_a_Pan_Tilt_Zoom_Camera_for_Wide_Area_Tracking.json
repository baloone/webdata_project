{"id":"259914738_Continuous_Localization_and_Mapping_of_a_Pan_Tilt_Zoom_Camera_for_Wide_Area_Tracking","abstract":"Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras are powerful to support object identification and\nrecognition in far-field scenes. Real-time detection and tracking of targets\nwith these cameras is nevertheless complicated by the fact that the geometrical\nrelationship between the camera view and the 3D observed scene is time-varying\nand, over long periods of operation, real world scenes exhibit changes either\ndue to objects or context variations. In this paper, we present a solution that\nprovides continuous estimation of the camera pose and mapping from scene\nlandmarks, which is robust to rapid camera motion, changes of the environment\ndue to illumination or objects, and scales beyond thousands of landmarks. The\nestimation of camera pose permits to compute the relationship between the\npositions of the targets in the 3D world plane and their corresponding\npositions in the 2D image, and to perform real-time tracking of multiple\ntargets in world coordinates. Since camera motion is compensated, an absolute\nreference coordinate system can be used and targets can be tracked in the world\nplane with high and stable degree of accuracy also at large distances and any\nzooming level. We provide experimental evidence that the solution proposed is\ncapable of supporting effective real-time tracking of multiple targets with PTZ\ncameras.","authors":["Giuseppe Lisanti","Iacopo Masi","Federico Pernici","Alberto Del Bimbo"],"meta":["October 2016Machine Vision and Applications 27(7)","DOI:10.1007/s00138-016-0799-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278099028_Self-Calibration_of_Rotating_and_Zooming_Cameras","275256125_Real-time_monocular_image-based_6-DoF_localization","256473962_To_Track_or_To_Detect_An_Ensemble_Framework_for_Optimal_Selection","243785611_Towards_Calibrating_a_Pan-Tilt-Zoom_Camera_Network","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","317248377_ALGORITHM_FOR_TRACKING_MULTIPLE_TARGETS","315400876_Real-time_self-localization_from_panoramic_images_on_mobile_devices","312471414_Detection_and_Tracking_of_Point_Features","262311484_Online_Learned_Discriminative_Part-Based_Appearance_Models_for_Multi-human_Tracking","259350450_Object_Tracking_by_Oversampling_Local_Features","241191639_Continuous_recovery_for_real_time_pan_tilt_zoom_localization_and_mapping","240308786_Keeping_a_Pan-Tilt-Zoom_Camera_Calibrated","236916460_A_General_Framework_for_Tracking_Multiple_People_from_a_Moving_Camera","232632415_Pedestrian_detection_A_benchmark","227280412_CONDENSATION-conditional_density_propagation_for_visual_tracking"]}
