{"id":"320689029_Impacting_IT_Enrolments_What_Factors_Most_Influence_Student_Career_Decisions","abstract":"This paper reports preliminary data on factors influencing student perceptions affecting their decision to study information technology in later years of high school and at university. Factors from the literature mainly align as social or structural. This research has found that structural factors (curriculum and teachers) have the most influence on student decision making about course selection related to IT subjects. Subsequent research will experimentally examine curriculum changes and teacher preparation for improvements of student perception about IT subject selection and IT careers.","authors":["Rohan Genrich","Mark Toleman","Dave Roberts"],"meta":["December 2014","Conference: Australasian Conference on Information SystemsAt: Auckland, New Zealand."],"references":[]}
