{"id":"262399549_Computational_thinking_in_educational_activities_An_evaluation_of_the_educational_game_Light-Bot","abstract":"Computational thinking is gaining recognition as an important skill set for students, both in computer science and other disciplines. Although there has been much focus on this field in recent years, it is rarely taught as a formal course within the curriculum, and there is little consensus on what exactly computational thinking entails and how to teach and evaluate it. To address these concerns, we have developed a computational thinking framework to be used as a planning and evaluative tool. Within this framework, we aim to unify the differing opinions about what computational thinking should involve. As a case study, we have applied the framework to Light-Bot, an educational game with a strong focus on programming, and found that the framework provides us with insight into the usefulness of the game to reinforce computer science concepts.","authors":["Lindsey Ann Gouws","Karen Bradshaw","Peter Wentworth"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.1145/2462476.2466518","Conference: Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education","Project: CS Education"],"references":["274309848_Computational_Thinking","221538265_Thinking_about_Computational_Thinking","220612700_Developing_a_computer_science-specific_learning_taxonomy","220420371_Computational_thinking","23142610_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","4336467_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","220807945_Computational_thinking_-_What_it_might_mean_and_what_we_might_do_about_it"]}
