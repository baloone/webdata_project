{"id":"320846443_Phase_differentiation_by_electron_backscatter_diffraction_using_the_dictionary_indexing_approach","abstract":"Using the dictionary approach to Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis, we address: (1) phase differentiation in highly-deformed or fine-grained materials; and (2) phase differentiation between phases with the same Bravais lattice and different lattice parameters. We introduce a phase differentiation confidence index based on the dictionary indexing approach and apply the index to scenarios where the classical EBSD indexing approach has major difficulties in delivering reliable results. We show that dictionary indexing successfully differentiates the phases in these scenarios and report on the confidence of such differentiations. We also show that dictionary indexing is sensitive to hydrostatic strain and can identify the correct amount of hydrostatic strain present in a material.","authors":["Farangis Ram","M.
