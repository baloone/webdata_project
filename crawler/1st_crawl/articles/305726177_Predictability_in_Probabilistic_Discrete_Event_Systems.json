{"id":"305726177_Predictability_in_Probabilistic_Discrete_Event_Systems","abstract":"Predictability is a key property\nallowing one to expect\nin advance the occurrence\nof a fault in a system based on its observed events. Existing works give a binary answer to the question of knowing whether a system is predictable or not. In this paper, we consider discrete event systems where probabilities of the transitions are available. We show how to take advantage of this information to perform a Markov chain-based analysis and extract probability values that give a finer appreciation of the degree of predictability. This analysis is particularly important in case of non predictable systems.","authors":["Farid Nouioua","Philippe Dague","Lina Ye"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-42972-4_47","In book: Soft Methods for Data Science (pp.381-389)"],"references":["281050656_Foundation_of_Diagnosis_and_Predictability_in_Probabilistic_Systems","271549466_Predictability_Analysis_of_Distributed_Discrete_Event_Systems","237012713_Predictability_of_Event_Occurrences_in_Timed_Systems","220837694_A_probabilistic_analysis_of_diagnosability_in_discrete_event_systems","3032073_Diagnosability_of_stochastic_discrete-event_systems","3022357_Diagnosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","2370706_A_Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Testing_Diagnosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","284528176_Finite_Markov_Chains","269262922_Predictability_of_Sequence_Patterns_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","264510683_On_Fault_Predictability_in_Stochastic_Discrete_Event_Systems","220156357_Predictability_of_Event_Occurrences_in_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","29596774_Predictability_of_Sequence_Patterns_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","3024475_Polynomial-time_verification_of_diagnosability_of_partially_observed_discrete-event_systems"]}
