{"id":"324921881_FEW-WEIGHT_CODES_FROM_TRACE_CODES_OVER","abstract":"We construct two families of few-weight codes for the Lee weight over the ring $R_{k}$ based on two different defining sets. For the first defining set, taking the Gray map, we obtain an infinite family of binary two-weight codes which are in fact $2^{k}$ -fold replicated MacDonald codes. For the second defining set, we obtain two infinite families of few-weight codes. These few-weight codes can be used to implement secret-sharing schemes.","authors":["Minjia Shi","Yue Guan","CHENCHEN WANG","Patrick Sol√©"],"meta":["May 2018Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 98(01):1-8","DOI:10.1017/S0004972718000291","Project: Trace codes over rings with few weights"],"references":["274012459_A_Class_of_Two-Weight_and_Three-Weight_Codes_and_Their_Applications_in_Secret_Sharing","312236880_Optimal_binary_codes_from_trace_codes_over_a_non-chain_ring","311430484_Two_New_Families_of_Two-Weight_Codes","309081987_Optimal_two_weight_codes_over_mathbbF_2umathbbF_2","285458671_A_class_of_q-ary_linear_codes_derived_from_irreducible_cyclic_codes","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","281546077_A_Class_of_Binary_Linear_Codes_with_at_Most_Three_Weights","257481853_Codes_over_RkRk_Gray_maps_and_their_binary_images","248414186_Weights_of_linear_codes_and_strongly_regular_normed_spaces","247891774_The_Geometry_of_Two-Weight_Codes","234813067_Design_Methods_for_Maximum_Minimum-Distance_Error-Correcting_Codes","220909314_Covering_and_Secret_Sharing_with_Linear_Codes","3079587_Minimal_vectors_in_linear_codes"]}
