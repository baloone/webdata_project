{"id":"321586129_Efficient_enhancement_on_cellular_automata_for_data_mining","abstract":"Cellular Automata (CA) is a discrete dynamical system consists of an array of \nidentically programmed automata, or cells, which interact with one another in a \nneighborhood relationship and have definite state. It can be used to show how the elements of a system interact with each other. It has a complex and varied behavior whose behavior is completely specified in terms of a local relation. Represented as a uniform grid, the time advances in discrete steps and the laws are expressed in a small lockup table through â€¦","authors":["Azzam Sleit","Abdel Latif Abu Dalhoum","Ibraheem Al-Dhamari","Dr-Aiman Mamdouh Ayyal Awwad"],"meta":["July 2009","Conference: Proceedings of the 13th WSEAS international conference on Systems, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society (WSEAS)"],"references":[]}
