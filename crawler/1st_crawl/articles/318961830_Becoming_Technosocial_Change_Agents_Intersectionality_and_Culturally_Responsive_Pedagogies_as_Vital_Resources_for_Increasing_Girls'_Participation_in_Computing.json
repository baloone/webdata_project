{"id":"318961830_Becoming_Technosocial_Change_Agents_Intersectionality_and_Culturally_Responsive_Pedagogies_as_Vital_Resources_for_Increasing_Girls'_Participation_in_Computing","abstract":"Drawing from our two-year ethnography, we juxtapose the experiences of two cohorts in one culturally responsive computing program, examining how the program fostered girlsâ€™ emerging identities as technosocial change agents. In presenting this in-depth and up-close exploration, we simultaneously identify conditions that both facilitated and limited the program's potential. Ultimately, we illustrate how these findings can enhance anthropological research and practice in youth identity, culturally responsive pedagogies, and computing education.","authors":["Catherine Ashcraft","Elizabeth K.
