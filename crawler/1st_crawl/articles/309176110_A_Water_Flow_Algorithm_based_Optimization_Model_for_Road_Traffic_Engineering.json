{"id":"309176110_A_Water_Flow_Algorithm_based_Optimization_Model_for_Road_Traffic_Engineering","abstract":"A high cost and inefficient way in eliminating congestion of road traffic potentially generates other problems appear. Thus, an optimal engineering of road traffic is necessary. Here, the optimization model was technically constructed to degrade the congestion level through the conceptual method of water flow algorithm (WFA). The model was analyzed and designed as well via object oriented instruments. Three major direct parameters (i.e. road traffic delay, density, and degree of saturation) support to optimize the road traffic velocity. Finally, the proposed model can recommend a decision that will be engaged to re-engineer the road traffic. The suggested decision exposes an improved velocity condition of traffic flow. The model was realized to decrease the road traffic congestion in area Tangerang Selatan, province Banten, Indonesia.","authors":["Ditdit Nugeraha Utama","Fauzan Affan Zaki","Intan Juliani Munjeri","Nidya Putri"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICACSIS.2016.7872734","Conference: 2016 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS 2016)At: Malang, IndonesiaVolume: 7","Project: ecoDSS for Intelligent Village and City"],"references":["343648607_The_Optimization_of_the_3-d_Structure_of_Plants_Using_Functional-Structural_Plant_Models_Case_Study_of_Rice_Oryza_sativa_L_in_Indonesia","311409157_F-multicriteria_based_Decision_Support_System_for_Road_Repair_and_Maintenance_Case_Study_Three_Areas_in_Tangerang_Selatan_Province_Banten_Indonesia","305768394_F-multicriteria_based_decision_support_system_for_road_repair_and_maintenance_case_study_three_areas_in_Tangerang_Selatan_province_Banten_Indonesia","284559614_The_Delays_for_Signalized_Intersection_Using_ATCS_Data_and_Field_Survey_Method_at_Kerten-Intersection_of_Surakarta","282316968_Influence_of_Lane_and_Vehicle_Subclass_on_Free-flow_Speeds_for_Urban_Roads_in_Heterogeneous_Traffic","281999072_A_water_flow-like_algorithm_for_capacitated_vehicle_routing_problem","270919114_A_Water_Flow-Like_Algorithm_for_the_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","257728228_Overviews_of_Failure_Mode_and_Reconstruction_of_Road_Traffic_Facilities_in_Wenchuan_Earthquak-stricken_Areas","257716676_Road_Traffic_Engineering_Application_in_Mathematics_Information_Technology","223805105_Simulating_traffic_engineering_solutions_to_predict_changes_in_driving_behaviour","253763766_Optimal_Groundwater_Management_1_Simulated_Annealing","228571615_Water_flow-like_algorithm_for_object_grouping_problems"]}
