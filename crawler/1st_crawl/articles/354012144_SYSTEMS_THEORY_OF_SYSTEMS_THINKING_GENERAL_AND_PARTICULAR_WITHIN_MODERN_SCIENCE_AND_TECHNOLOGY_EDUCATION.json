Today we accept that thinking means processing of information what is important for management of human body life. Studying organization of human brainwork, people have discovered that all our thoughts and thinking activities are interconnected and form definite hierarchic structures. Humans reflect world as a set or network of diverse phenomena by building corresponding theories or models of observed phenomena. In other words, all phenomena in human world of thoughts are reflected as SYSTEMS, which are organizational units of Systems Thinking. Every system contains their interconnected parts and as a whole is a part of surrounding medium, made from other systems. Such hierarchic integral understanding and comprehension of human brainwork today has become the basic value of Systems Theory as theory of Systems Thinking.","authors":["Andris Broks"],"meta":["August 2016Journal of Baltic Science Education 15(4):408-410","DOI:10.33225/jbse/16.15.408"],"references":[]}
