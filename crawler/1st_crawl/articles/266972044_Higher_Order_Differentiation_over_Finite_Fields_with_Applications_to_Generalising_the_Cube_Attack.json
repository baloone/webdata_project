{"id":"266972044_Higher_Order_Differentiation_over_Finite_Fields_with_Applications_to_Generalising_the_Cube_Attack","abstract":"Higher order differentiation was introduced in a cryptographic context by\nLai. Several attacks can be viewed in the context of higher order\ndifferentiations, amongst them the cube attack and the AIDA attack. All of the\nabove have been developed for the binary case.\nWe examine differentiation in larger fields, starting with the field $GF(p)$\nof integers modulo a prime $p$. We prove a number of results on differentiating\npolynomials over such fields and then apply these techniques to generalising\nthe cube attack to $GF(p)$. The crucial difference is that now the degree in\neach variable can be higher than one, and our proposed attack will\ndifferentiate several times with respect to each variable (unlike the classical\ncube attack and its larger field version described by Dinur and Shamir, both of\nwhich differentiate at most once with respect to each variable).\nFinally we describe differentiation over finite fields $GF(p^m)$ with $p^m$\nelements and prove that it can be reduced to differentiation over $GF(p)$, so a\ncube attack over $GF(p^m)$ would be equivalent to cube attacks over $GF(p)$.","authors":["Ana Sﾄネﾄトean","Matei Mandache-Sﾄネﾄトean","Richard Winter","Raphael C.-W.
