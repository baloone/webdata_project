{"id":"230391964_Mutually_Orthogonal_Graph_Squares","abstract":"A decomposition ={G1, G2,…,Gs} of a graph G is a partition of the edge set of G into edge-disjoint subgraphs G1, G2,…,Gs. If Gi≅H for all i∈{1, 2, …, s}, then is a decomposition of G by H. Two decompositions ={G1, G2, …, Gn} and ℱ={F1, F2,…,Fn} of the complete bipartite graph Kn,n are orthogonal if |E(Gi)∩E(Fj)|=1 for all i,j∈{1, 2, …, n}. A set of decompositions {1, 2, …, k} of Kn, n is a set of k mutually orthogonal graph squares (MOGS) if i and j are orthogonal for all i, j∈{1, 2, …, k} and i≠j. For any bipartite graph G with n edges, N(n, G) denotes the maximum number k in a largest possible set {1, 2, …, k} of MOGS of Kn, n by G. El-Shanawany conjectured that if p is a prime number, then N(p, Pp+ 1)=p, where Pp+ 1 is the path on p+ 1 vertices. In this article, we prove this conjecture. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
