{"id":"263249877_On_the_Asymptotic_Normality_of_Test_Statistics_Using_Song's_Kurtosis","abstract":"In this article, we consider the multivariate normality test based on the sample measure of multivariate kurtosis defined by Song (2001 Song, K.-S. 2001. Rényi information, loglikelihood and an intrinsic distribution measure. J. Stat. Plan. Inf.,, 93: 51–69. ). We calculate moments of Song's kurtosis when covariance matrix\nis known and unknown. In addition, we derive expectations and variances of the multivariate sample kurtosis under normality and propose three standardized test statistics using these expectations and variances. When\nis known, we also propose a test statistic whose approximate accuracy for multivariate normal distribution is improved rather than the standardized statistics by normalizing transformation. In order to evaluate accuracy of proposed test statistics, the numerical results by Monte Carlo simulation for some selected values of parameters are presented.","authors":["Rie Enomoto","Naoya Okamoto","Takashi Seo"],"meta":["January 2013Journal of Statistical Theory and Practice 7(1)","DOI:10.1080/15598608.2013.756351"],"references":["38359722_Limit_Distributions_for_Mardia's_Measure_of_Multivariate_Skewness","23634050_On_assessing_multivariate_normality_based_on_Shapiro-Wilk_W_statistic","266368775_On_the_estimation_of_kurtosis_parameter_in_elliptical_distributions","265367747_Renyi_information_loglikelihood_and_an_intrinsic_distribution_measure","265366959_Applications_of_Some_Measures_of_Multivariate_Skewness_and_Kurtosis_in_Testing_Normality_and_Robustness_Studies","264963567_Some_Techniques_for_Assessing_Multivarate_Normality_Based_on_the_Shapiro-_Wilk_W","251816857_On_the_Distribution_of_Kurtosis_Test_for_Multivariate_Normality","246974875_Normalizing_Transformations_of_Some_Statistics_in_Multivariate_Analysis","246792696_Measures_of_Multivariate_Skewness_and_Kurtosis_with_Applications","243049839_On_Mardia's_kurtosis_test_for_multivariate_normality","242466524_On_Tests_for_Multivariate_Normality","232396338_On_the_distributions_of_multivariate_sample_skewness","222189846_A_measure_of_skewness_and_kurtosis_and_a_graphical_method_for_assessing_multivariate_normality","215439132_An_analysis_of_variance_test_for_normality","200806332_An_Analysis_of_Variance_Test_for_Normality","23645079_On_Mardia's_and_Song's_measures_of_kurtosis_in_elliptical_distributions"]}
