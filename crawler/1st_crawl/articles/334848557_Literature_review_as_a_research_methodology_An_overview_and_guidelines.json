{"id":"334848557_Literature_review_as_a_research_methodology_An_overview_and_guidelines","abstract":"Knowledge production within the field of business research is accelerating at a tremendous speed while at the same time remaining fragmented and interdisciplinary. This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a specific methodology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and offers an overview of different types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper. It also discusses common pitfalls and how to get literature reviews published.","authors":["Hannah Snyder"],"meta":["August 2019Journal of Business Research 104:333-339","DOI:10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.07.039"],"references":["322812466_When_Does_Market_Share_Matter_New_Empirical_Generalizations_from_a_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Market_Share-Performance_Relationship","321772161_Big_Data_Big_Insights_Advancing_Service_Innovation_and_Design_With_Machine_Learning","315716520_A_review_and_meta-analysis_of_country-of-origin_research","314258403_The_changing_role_of_the_health_care_customer_review_synthesis_and_research_agenda","299399282_Ownership_of_Corporations_A_Review_Synthesis_and_Research_Agenda","291387528_Defining_service_innovation_A_review_and_synthesis","320172114_Review_articles_purpose_process_and_structure","320169915_Debates_and_assumptions_about_motion_picture_performance_a_meta-analysis","313744825_Primary_secondary_and_metaanalysis_of_research","292211039_Identifying_categories_of_service_innovation_A_review_and_synthesis_of_the_literature"]}
