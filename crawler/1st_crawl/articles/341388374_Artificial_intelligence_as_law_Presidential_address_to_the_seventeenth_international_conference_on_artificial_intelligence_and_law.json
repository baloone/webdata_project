{"id":"341388374_Artificial_intelligence_as_law_Presidential_address_to_the_seventeenth_international_conference_on_artificial_intelligence_and_law","abstract":"Information technology is so ubiquitous and AIâ€™s progress so inspiring that also legal professionals experience its benefits and have high expectations. At the same time, the powers of AI have been rising so strongly that it is no longer obvious that AI applications (whether in the law or elsewhere) help promoting a good society; in fact they are sometimes harmful. Hence many argue that safeguards are needed for AI to be trustworthy, social, responsible, humane, ethical. In short: AI should be good for us. But how to establish proper safeguards for AI? One strong answer readily available is: consider the problems and solutions studied in AI & Law. AI & Law has worked on the design of social, explainable, responsible AI aligned with human values for decades already, AI & Law addresses the hardest problems across the breadth of AI (in reasoning, knowledge, learning and language), and AI & Law inspires new solutions (argumentation, schemes and norms, rules and cases, interpretation). It is argued that the study of AI as Law supports the development of an AI that is good for us, making AI & Law more relevant than ever.","authors":["Bart Verheij"],"meta":["May 2020Artificial Intelligence and Law 28(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10506-020-09266-0","Project: Artificial intelligence and argumentation"],"references":["343944380_Arguments_for_good_artificial_intelligence","338824775_Encoded_summarization_summarizing_documents_into_continuous_vector_space_for_legal_case_retrieval","334700359_Analyzing_the_Simonshaven_Case_With_and_Without_Probabilities","334051389_Using_machine_learning_to_predict_decisions_of_the_European_Court_of_Human_Rights","345677813_Artificial_Intelligence_29th_Benelux_Conference_BNAIC_2017_Groningen_The_Netherlands_November_8-9_2017_Revised_Selected_Papers_29th_Benelux_Conference_BNAIC_2017_Groningen_The_Netherlands_November_8-9","334643453_Explainable_Bayesian_Network_Query_Results_via_Natural_Language_Generation_Systems","332168026_Evidential_reasoning","327837566_Abstract_Argumentation_for_Case-Based_Reasoning","325555949_Artificial_intelligence_and_legal_analytics_New_tools_for_law_practice_in_the_digital_age","321982329_Formalizing_arguments_rules_and_cases"]}
