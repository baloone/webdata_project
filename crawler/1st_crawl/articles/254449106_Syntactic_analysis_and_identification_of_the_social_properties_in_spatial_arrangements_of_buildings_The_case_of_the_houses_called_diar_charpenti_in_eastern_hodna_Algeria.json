The goal is to know whether, contrary to the variety of its exogenous facades, this type of habitat is a homogeneous space scheme that could be identified as being architecturally genotype. The approach used is the syntactic analysis of Hillier and Hanson (1984, 1996, and 1998). It offers the possibility to identify the structures of the socio-cultural expression and social logic embodied in the spatial distribution of domestic forms.","authors":["Hynda Boutabba","Farhi Abdallah"],"meta":["November 2011Theoretical and Empirical Researches in Urban Management 6(4)"],"references":["313173499_The_Beaubourg_effect_Implosion_and_deterrence","292876136_Le_chez-soi_dans_tous_les_sens","292241365_Identity_and_environment_a_cross-_cultural_perspective","289689388_Developpement_rural_et_dynamique_des_rapports_de_genre_Mobilite_et_argent_au_Cameroun","289550168_The_Role_of_Housing_in_the_Experience_of_Dwelling","275938800_La_maison_rustique_logique_sociale_et_composition_architecturale","238786191_The_Social_Logic_of_Space","238783380_Decoding_Homes_and_Houses","44827694_Anthropologie_Structurale_I","23540936_Spatial_types_in_traditional_Turkish_houses"]}
