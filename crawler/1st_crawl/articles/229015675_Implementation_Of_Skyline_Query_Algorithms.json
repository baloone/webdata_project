{"id":"229015675_Implementation_Of_Skyline_Query_Algorithms","abstract":"In this work we extend the public available Spatial Index Library to support skyline queries. More specific, We im-plement three basic algorithms (Block Nested Loop, Divide and Conquer and Branch and Bound) and the naive brute force approach. Finally we test these implementations in various datasets, and we compare their efficiency in terms of disk I/Os and run time.","authors":["Marios Kokkodis","Pamela Bhattacharya"],"meta":[],"references":["234807778_On_Finding_the_Maxima_of_a_Set_of_Vectors","220225024_Progressive_Skyline_Computation_in_Database_Systems","221310438_Shooting_Stars_in_the_Sky_An_Online_Algorithm_for_Skyline_Queries","221310241_Efficient_Progressive_Skyline_Computation","220387818_SaIL_A_Spatial_Index_Library_for_Efficient_Application_Integration","2374777_The_Skyline_Operator"]}
