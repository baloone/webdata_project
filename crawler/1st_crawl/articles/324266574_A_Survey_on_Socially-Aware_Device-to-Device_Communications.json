{"id":"324266574_A_Survey_on_Socially-Aware_Device-to-Device_Communications","abstract":"Device-to-device (D2D) communication is continuously\nevolving and engulfing a wide diversity of proximate\nservices and applications, which is considered as one of the key\ntechnologies in the 5G ecosystem. It is argued that direct communications\nparadigm advantages may not be entirely captured\nwithout embracing the concepts of the social-domain. Following\nthe explosion of social networks and smart mobile devices,\nsocial-interactions among mobile users enable the promotion of\nD2D co-operations. In this article, we first present a systematic\noverview of the socially-unaware technical challenges and the\nprospective applications to consolidate a background on D2D\ncommunications. Next, all the social features utilized in tackling\nand improving the technical issues and the applications are\nbriefed, respectively. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey\non socially-aware D2D communications, where various features\nof social-domain are leveraged such as ties, community, trust,\nand selfishness to tackle the D2D technical issues and improve\nthe performance of prospective D2D applications. We categorize\nstate of the art socially-aware D2D communications into two main\nsections. The first section considers technical issues, while the\nsecond section pertains to their applications to provide insightful\ninformation and motivate more in-depth studies in this area.\nFor each aforementioned section, we overview technical aspects\nand classify the core contributions based on approaches used\nand the social features utilized. In the discussion section, we\nsummarize the socially-aware D2D communications and present\nlessons learned. Finally, we highlight the open research challenges\nin this field and predict future research trends.","authors":["Manzoor Ahmed","Yong Li","Muhammad Waqas","Muhammad Sheraz"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE
