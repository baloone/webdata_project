{"id":"267395592_In-Network_Leader_Selection_for_Acyclic_Graphs","abstract":"We study the problem of leader selection in leader-follower multi-agent\nsystems that are subject to stochastic disturbances. This problem arises in\napplications such as vehicle formation control, distributed clock\nsynchronization, and distributed localization in sensor networks. We pose a new\nleader selection problem called the in-network leader selection problem.\nInitially, an arbitrary node is selected to be a leader, and in all consequent\nsteps the network must have exactly one leader. The agents must collaborate to\nfind the leader that minimizes the variance of the deviation from the desired\ntrajectory, and they must do so within the network using only communication\nbetween neighbors. To develop a solution for this problem, we first show a\nconnection between the leader selection problem and a class of discrete\nfacility location problems. We then leverage a previously proposed\nself-stabilizing facility location algorithm to develop a self-stabilizing\nin-network leader selection algorithm for acyclic graphs.","authors":["Stacy Patterson"],"meta":["October 2014Proceedings of the American Control Conference 2015","DOI:10.1109/ACC.2015.7170757","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269935598_Efficient_Optimal_k-Leader_Selection_for_Coherent_One-Dimensional_Formations","242914003_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions-I","239939804_Minimizing_Convergence_Error_in_Multi-Agent_Systems_Via_Leader_Selection_A_Supermodular_Optimization_Approach","235358694_Algorithms_for_Leader_Selection_in_Stochastically_Forced_Consensus_Networks","313566026_Coordination_variables_and_consensus_building_in_multiple_vehicle_systems","277296348_Distributed_Algorithms","271549519_Information_centrality_and_optimal_leader_selection_in_noisy_networks","245954051_Distributed_Algorithms_Chapter_6_7","239552157_Self_stabilizing_systems_in_spite_of_distributed_control","235446798_An_Algorithmic_Approach_to_Network_Location_Problems_II_The_p_-Medians","230609310_A_Supermodular_Optimization_Framework_for_Leader_Selection_Under_Link_Noise_in_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems","226420782_Resistance_Distance","225208305_Coordination_Variables_and_Consensus_Building_in_Multiple_Vehicle_Systems","228627184_Minimizing_effective_resistance_of_a_graph_SIAM_Rev_501_37-66","225246148_An_analysis_of_approximations_for_maximizing_submodular_set_functions-II"]}
