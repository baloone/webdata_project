Extensive use of computers will result in computer vision syndrome (CVS), and the prevalence is increased dramatically. The main objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of CVS among bank workers in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia.\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional institution-based study was conducted among computer-using bank workers in Gondar city from April to June, 2015. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and observations with checklists, entered with Epi Infoâ„¢ 7 and analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were carried out to compute the different rates, proportion and relevant associations.\n\nResults\nAmong the total 304 computer-using bank workers, the prevalence of CVS was 73% (95% confidence interval [CI]=68.04, 78.02). Blurred vision (42.4%), headache (23.0%) and redness (23.0%) were the most experienced symptoms. Inappropriate sitting position was 2.3 times (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.33; 95% CI=1.27, 4.28) more likely to be associated with CVS when compared with appropriate sitting position. Those working on the computer for more than 20 minutes without break were nearly 2 times (AOR=1.93; 95% CI=1.11, 3.35) more likely to have suffered from CVS when compared with those taking break within 20 minutes, and those wearing eye glasses were 3 times (AOR=3.19; 95% CI=1.07, 9.51) more likely to suffer from CVS when compared with those not wearing glasses.\n\nConclusion\nAbout three-fourths of computer-using bank workers suffered from CVS with the most experienced symptoms being blurred vision, headache and redness of eyes. In appropriate sitting position, working on the computer without a break for more than 20 minutes and wearing eye glasses were independently associated with CVS.","authors":["Natnael Lakachew Assefa","Dawit Zenebe Weldemichael","Haile Woretaw Alemu","Dereje Hayilu"],"meta":["April 2017Clinical Optometry Volume 9:67-76","DOI:10.2147/OPTO.S126366"],"references":["261841371_Computer_Use_and_Vision-Related_Problems_Among_University_Students_In_Ajman_United_Arab_Emirate","261841356_Computer_Vision_Syndrome_and_Associated_Factors_Among_Medical_and_Engineering_Students_in_Chennai","236095012_Evaluation_of_the_Factors_which_Contribute_to_the_Ocular_Complaints_in_Computer_Users","233874968_Assessment_of_water_sanitation_and_hygiene_practice_and_associated_factors_among_people_living_with_HIVAIDS_home_based_care_services_in_Gondar_city_Ethiopia","228478599_Computer_Vision_SyndromeCVS_Recognition_and_Control_in_Software_Professionals","6242950_Computer_vision_syndrome_A_study_of_the_knowledge_attitudes_and_practices_in_Indian_Ophthalmologists","263897542_0297_The_prevalence_of_risk_factors_associated_with_Computer_Vision_Syndrome_among_computer_works_in_Sao_Paulo_Brazil","258202984_Computer_vision_syndrome_A_study_of_knowledge_and_practices_in_university_students","40688577_Impact_of_computer_use_on_children's_vision","19467716_The_computer_user_syndrome","6140024_Computer_Use_Symptoms_and_Quality_of_Life","5860134_The_Impact_of_a_Computerized_Work_Environment_on_Professional_Occupational_Groups_and_Behavioural_and_Physiological_Risk_Factors_for_Musculoskeletal_Symptoms_A_Literature_Review","5283266_A_study_of_computer-related_upper_limb_discomfort_and_computer_vision_syndrome"]}
