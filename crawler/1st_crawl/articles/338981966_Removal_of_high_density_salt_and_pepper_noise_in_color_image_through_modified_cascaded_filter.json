{"id":"338981966_Removal_of_high_density_salt_and_pepper_noise_in_color_image_through_modified_cascaded_filter","abstract":"A modified cascaded filter (MCF) for the restoration of color pictures that are extremely corrupted by salt and pepper noise and random valued impulse noise are projected in this article. MCF algorithm restores the noisy pixel by trimmed median value while other pixel values, 0’s and 255’s are present in the selected window using decision based median filter (DMF) and when the pixel values are 0’s and 255’s then the noise pixel is replaced by mean value of all the elements present in the selected window using unsymmetrical trimmed mean filtering. This modified cascaded filter proves better results than the standard median filter, DMF, and alpha trimmed median filter, UTMF. The MCF is analyzed against various color images and it provides superior peak signal-to-noise ratio and image enhancement factor.","authors":["Karthik Balaguru","T. Krishna Kumar","S. P.
