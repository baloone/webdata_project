{"id":"343974447_Who_Gets_Credit_for_AI-Generated_Art","abstract":"The recent sale of an AI-generated portrait for $432,000 at Christie’s art auction has raised questions about how credit and responsibility should be allocated to individuals involved, and how the anthropomorphic perception of the AI system contributed to the artwork’s success. Here, we identify natural heterogeneity in the extent to which different people perceive AI as anthropomorphic. We find that differences in the perception of AI anthropomorphicity are associated with different allocations of responsibility to the AI system, and credit to different stakeholders involved in art production. We then show that perceptions of AI anthropomorphicity can be manipulated by changing the language used to talk about AI –– as a tool vs agent –– with consequences for artists and AI practitioners. Our findings shed light on what is at stake when we anthropomorphize AI systems, and offers an empirical lens to reason about how to allocate credit and responsibility to human stakeholders.","authors":["Ziv Epstein","Sydney Levine","David Gertler Rand","Iyad Rahwan"],"meta":["August 2020iScience 23(9):101515","DOI:10.1016/j.isci.2020.101515"],"references":["341437425_Blame_It_on_the_Self-Driving_Car_How_Autonomous_Vehicles_Can_Alter_Consumer_Morality","340320918_Anthropomorphism_in_AI","335967875_The_Rhetoric_and_Reality_of_Anthropomorphism_in_Artificial_Intelligence","333228756_End-to-end_lung_cancer_screening_with_three-dimensional_deep_learning_on_low-dose_chest_computed_tomography","332636704_Machine_behaviour","355001383_Human_detection_of_machine-manipulated_media","343905750_GAN_dissection_Visualizing_and_understanding_generative_adversarial_networks","339804722_Human_ownership_of_artificial_creativity","333256435_Research_for_practice_Troubling_trends_in_machine-learning_scholarship","332328217_Autonomy_Authenticity_Authorship_and_Intention_in_Computer_Generated_Art"]}
