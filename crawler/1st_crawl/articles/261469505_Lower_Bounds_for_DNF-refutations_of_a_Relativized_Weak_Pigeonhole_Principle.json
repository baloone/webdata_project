{"id":"261469505_Lower_Bounds_for_DNF-refutations_of_a_Relativized_Weak_Pigeonhole_Principle","abstract":"The relativized weak pigeonhole principle states that if at least 2\nn\nout of\nn\n2\npigeons fly into\nn\nholes, then some hole must be doubly occupied. We prove that every DNF-refutation of the CNF encoding of this principle requires size\n\n$2^{\\left( {{\\rm{log\\ }}n} \\right)^{3/2 - \\varepsilon } } $\n\nfor every ε﹥0 and every sufficiently large\nn\n. By reducing it to the standard weak pigeonhole principle with 2\nn\npigeons and\nn\nholes, we also show that this lower bound is essentially tight in that there exist DNF-refutations of size\n\n$2^{\\left( {{\\rm{log\\ }}n} \\right)^{O\\left( 1 \\right)} } $\n\neven in\nR\n(log). For the lower bound proof we need to discuss the existence of unbalanced low-degree bipartite expanders satisfying a certain robustness condition.","authors":["Albert Atserias","Moritz Müller","SERGI OLIVA"],"meta":["June 2013Journal of Symbolic Logic 80(02):109-120","DOI:10.1109/CCC.2013.20","Conference: Computational Complexity (CCC), 2013 IEEE Conference on"],"references":["324707399_Proofs_as_Games","316519975_Approximate_counting_with_uniform_constant_depth_circuits","289771432_Verification_Techniques_for_System-Level_Design","268637008_Proofs_as_Games","266516052_Random_graphs_2nd_ed","265435976_The_Complexity_of_Propositional_Proofs","261487581_Non-intrusive_fault_tolerance_in_soft_processors_through_circuit_duplication","254207431_A_bottom-up_approach_to_foundations_of_mathematics","251448900_First-Order_Proof_Theory_of_Arithmetic","242104244_On_Uniformity_within_NC"]}
