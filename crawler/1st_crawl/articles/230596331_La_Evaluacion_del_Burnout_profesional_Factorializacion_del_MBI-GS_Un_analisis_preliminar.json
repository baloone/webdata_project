{"id":"230596331_La_Evaluacion_del_Burnout_profesional_Factorializacion_del_MBI-GS_Un_analisis_preliminar","abstract":"Studied the usefulness and the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory–General Survey (MBI–GS) in a sample of 114 male and female administrative workers aged 25–59 yrs in Spain. Descriptive analysis and principal component factor analysis with oblimin rotation were performed. Correlations among the Cynicism, Professional Competency, and Emotional Exhaustion subscales were assessed. The results indicate that the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the MBI–GS are very satisfactory and correspond with those proposed in the Inventory manual. The findings show that factor analysis clearly reflected the proposed theoretical structure for the MBI–GS.","authors":["Bernardo Moreno-Jimenez","Raquel Rodríguez- Carvajal","Escobar"],"meta":["January 2001Ansiedad y Estres 7(1):69-77"],"references":["320083088_Burnout_in_health_professions_A_social_psychological_analysis","261693197_Consistency_of_the_burnout_costruct_across_occupations","250959599_Distinct_Models_of_Burnout_and_Commitment_among_Men_and_Women_in_the_Military","28113160_Validez_factorial_del_Maslach_Burnout_Inventory_en_una_muestra_multiocupacional","258135778_The_Factorial_Validity_of_the_Maslach_Burnout_Inventory_in_a_Sample_of_California_Elementary_and_Junior_High_School_Classroom_Teachers","240278511_The_Dimensionality_of_a_Modified_Form_of_the_Maslach_Burnout_Inventory_for_University_Students_in_a_TeacherTraining_Program","229665244_Self-reported_job_burnout_among_female_human_service_professionals","22308002_Self-Efficacy_-_Toward_A_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","19445024_Occupational_stress_social_support_and_burnout_among_correctional_officers_American_Journal_of_Community_Psychology14_177-193","13033253_The_need_for_an_operational_definition_of_burnout"]}
