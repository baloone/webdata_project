{"id":"270776038_Resonances_of_a_Forced_Mathieu_Equation_With_Reference_to_Wind_Turbine_Blades","abstract":"A horizontal axis wind turbine blade in steady rotation endures cyclic transverse loading due to wind shear, tower shadowing and gravity, and a cyclic gravitational axial loading at the same fundamental frequency. These direct and parametric excitations motivate the consideration of a forced Mathieu equation. This equation with cubic nonlinearity is analyzed for resonances by using the method of multiple scales. Superharmonic and subharmonic resonances occur. The effect of various parameters on the response of the system is demonstrated using the amplitude-frequency curve. The order-two superharmonic resonance persists for the linear system. While the order-two subharmonic response level is dependent on the ratio of parametric excitation and damping, nonlinearity is essential for the order-two subharmonic resonance. Order-three resonances are present in the system as well and, to first order, they are similar to those of the Duffing equation.","authors":["Venkatanarayanan Ramakrishnan","Brian F.
