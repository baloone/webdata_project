{"id":"305247830_Language_Bilingualism_and_Education","abstract":"As the first chapter in Part II, this chapter turns its attention to education. Focusing on the growing multilingualism in schools, the chapter reviews traditional definitions and types of bilingual education. It frames foreign/second language education, as well as bilingual education, as ways of enacting parallel monolingualisms, and then reviews ways in which this is resisted in classrooms all over the world. It also presents ways in which educators are promoting flexible languaging in teaching, transgressing the strict structures of dual language bilingual classrooms, as well as going beyond the traditional view of separate languages literacies.","authors":["Ofelia Garc√≠a","Wei Li"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1057/9781137385765_4","In book: Translanguaging (pp.46-62)"],"references":[]}
