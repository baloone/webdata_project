{"id":"241689195_Bit_commitment_protocol_based_on_random_oblivious_transfer_via_quantum_channel","abstract":"Constructing oblivious transfer and bit commitment protocols based on\nchannel's quantum nature to achieve statistical security has always been a\nbasic aspect of quantum cryptography. Here we put forward a scheme to reach\nthis goal. The idea is constructing first a random oblivious transfer (R-OT, an\nextension of Rabin's OT) protocol based on non-orthogonal states transmission\nover a quantum channel, then, as that usually do in modern cryptography, we\nconstruct a one-out-of-two oblivious transfer protocol on top of the R-OT\nprotocol. Finally, we present a bit commitment protocol based on the\none-out-of-two OT protocol, and show that it is statistically secure both in\nconcealing and binding.","authors":["Li Yang"],"meta":["June 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["47820789_Qubit-string-based_bit_commitment_protocols_with_physical_security","2620245_Is_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Really_Possible","2201608_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_is_Impossible","2198900_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Protocols_Based_on_Correlation_Immune_Boolean_Function","223151706_How_to_differentiate_between_non-orthogonal_states","222437412_How_to_differentiate_between_non-orthogonal_states"]}
