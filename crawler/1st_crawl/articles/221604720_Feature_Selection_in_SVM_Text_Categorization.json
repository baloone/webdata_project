{"id":"221604720_Feature_Selection_in_SVM_Text_Categorization","abstract":"Investigates the effect of prior feature selection in\nsupport vector machine (SVM) text categorization. The\ninput space was gradually increased by using mutual\ninformation (MI) filtering and part-of-speech (POS)\nfiltering, which determine the portion of words that are\nappropriate for learning from the information-theoretic\nand the linguistic perspectives, respectively. We tested\nthe two filtering methods on SVMs as well as a decision\ntree algorithm, C4.5. The SVMs' results common to both\nfiltering are that 1) the optimal number of features\ndiffered completely across categories, and 2) the average\nperformance for all categories was best when all of the\nwords were used. In addition, a comparison of the two\nfiltering methods clarified that POS filtering on SVMs\nconsistently outperformed MI filtering, which indicates\nthat SVMs cannot find irrelevant parts of speech. These\nresults suggest a simple strategy for the SVM text\ncategorization: use a full number of words found through a\nrough filtering technique like part-of-speech tagging.","authors":["Hirotoshi Taira","Masahiko Haruno"],"meta":["January 1999","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Sixteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Eleventh Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence, July 18-22, 1999, Orlando, Florida, USA."],"references":["221613897_Inductive_Learning_Algorithms_and_Representations_for_Text_Categorization","28351286_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines","292052938_A_comparison_of_two_learning_algorithms_for_text_categorization","223117716_Buckley_C_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval_Information_Processing_Management_245_513-523","221300528_Expert_Network_Effective_and_Efficient_Learning_from_Human_Decisions_in_Text_Categorization_and_Retrieval","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","215721756_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","200034021_Elements_of_Information_Theory"]}
