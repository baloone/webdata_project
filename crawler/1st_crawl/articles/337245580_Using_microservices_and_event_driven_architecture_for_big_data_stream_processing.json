{"id":"337245580_Using_microservices_and_event_driven_architecture_for_big_data_stream_processing","abstract":"Choosing the appropriate architecture for a big data project is not a straightforward task. The architect needs to have knowledge in the problem domain, future application requirements, big data technology landscape and architectural patterns. Today’s dynamic business environment enforces constantly evolving big data applications, which often need to process thousands of messages per second. Solutions implementing microservices and Event Driven Architecture (EDA) could provide scalability and extensibility to the required application. The article will outline microservices and EDA challenges, advantages and potential problems concerning big data stream processing.","authors":["Svetoslav Zhelev","Anna Rozeva"],"meta":["November 2019AIP Conference Proceedings 2172(1):090010","DOI:10.1063/1.5133587","Conference: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 45TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLICATION OF MATHEMATICS IN ENGINEERING AND ECONOMICS (AMEE’19)"],"references":["271967311_NoSQL_Distilled_A_Brief_Guide_to_the_Emerging_World_of_Polyglot_Persistence","224773145_Design_Patterns_Elements_of_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Software","220178128_Patterns_Architecture_and_Software"]}
