{"id":"322212473_A_Novel_Algorithm_based_on_Entanglement_Measurement_for_Improving_Speed_of_Quantum_Algorithms","abstract":"In this paper, we draw attention to consider that the quantum entanglement measurement should be implemented as a key part during manufacturing the quantum processors and quantum micro-controllers. This paper aims to harness the complete power of quantum mechanics by the crossover between entanglement measurements and quantum gates to propose a novel quantum computer algorithms and protocols. One of these measurements that we apply is concurrence, used to measure entanglement in a two-qubit system to solve the problem under scrutiny in n-dimensional vector space. The general algorithm to reshape many of the existing quantum algorithms, and to propose a novel quantum algorithms and protocols based on entanglement measurement is proposed in this paper.","authors":["Mohammed Zidan","Abdel-Haleem Abdel-Aty","Ahmed Younes","E.
