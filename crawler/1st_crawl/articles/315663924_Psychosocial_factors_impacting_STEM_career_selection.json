{"id":"315663924_Psychosocial_factors_impacting_STEM_career_selection","abstract":"Attention on P-20 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has increased\ntremendously in recent years. Many efforts are underway to promote STEM major and career selection\nacross the nation; specifically, in engineering and computer science. The authorsâ€™ purpose was to examine\nan underlying profile combinations of latent traits that influence student STEM career selection while\ndesigning serious educational games (SEGs). The authors combine a number of quantitative analysis\nmethods in an effort to develop a rich understanding of how a profile combination of traits interact with\none another to effect selection of STEM careers and majors. Study participants were 585 students enrolled\nin a full-time traditional high school. The addition of SEG design experiences into the student profile\nincreases the probability of STEM career selection by 5.1 times.","authors":["Richard L.
