{"id":"225502094_Convergence_to_Consensus_by_General_Averaging","abstract":"We investigate sufficient conditions for a discrete nonlinear non-homogeneous dynamical system to converge to consensus. We\nformulate a theorem which is based on the notion of averaging maps. Further on, we give examples that demonstrate that the\ntheory of convergence to consensus is still not complete.","authors":["Dirk A.
