{"id":"345316875_Parameter_Identification_of_a_Linear_Wave_Equation_From_Experimental_Boundary_Data","abstract":"Parameter identification of a drill string is studied. The system is modeled as a hyperbolic system with dynamical boundary conditions. The considered model is a wave equation with spatial dependent elasticity and viscous damping terms. The identification problem is recast as an optimization problem over an infinite-dimensional space. The developed approach ensures that the estimates of the parameters lie in a given set. A gradient descent-based algorithm is proposed to generate parameter estimates based on experimental data. A thorough comparative study with more classical algorithms is presented.","authors":["Christophe Roman","Francesco Ferrante","Christophe Prieur"],"meta":["November 2020Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TCST.2020.3032714"],"references":["327088809_A_Robust_Accelerated_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Strongly_Convex_Functions","321493951_Non-convex_Optimization_for_Machine_Learning","329464278_Boundary_control_of_a_wave_equation_with_in-domain_damping","324948849_Parameter_identification_for_the_linear_wave_equation_with_Robin_boundary_condition","321656499_Calculus_of_variations_approach_for_state_and_parameter_estimation_in_switched_1-D_hyperbolic_PDEs","316823879_Perturbation_Theory_of_Linear_Operators","316579053_A_meshfree_method_for_inverse_wave_propagation_using_collocation_and_radial_basis_functions","308152498_An_overview_of_gradient_descent_optimization_algorithms","307999014_A_control_oriented_guided_tour_in_oilwell_drilling_vibration_modeling","275983105_A_First_Course_in_Calculus"]}
