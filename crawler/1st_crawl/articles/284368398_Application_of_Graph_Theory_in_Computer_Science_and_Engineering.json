{"id":"284368398_Application_of_Graph_Theory_in_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","abstract":"raphs are considered as an excellent modeling tool which is used to model many type of relations amongst any physical situation. Many problems of real world can be represented by graphs. This paper explores different concepts involved in graph theory and their applications in computer science to demonstrate the utility of graph theory. These applications are presented especially to project the idea of graph theory and to demonstrate its objective and importance in computer science engineering.","authors":["Rishi PalSingh","Vandana Vandana"],"meta":["October 2014International Journal of Computer Applications 104(1):10-13","DOI:10.5120/18165-9025"],"references":[]}
