{"id":"352932372_Teaching_highly_mixed-ability_CS1_classes_A_proposed_approach","abstract":"With the increased reliance on technology, computer programming has emerged as an essential skill that is interesting to many audiences beyond merely computer scientists. As a result, many students from various disciplines take first-year computer science courses. This led to classrooms with a lot of diversity in student motivation, backgrounds, learning needs, and educational levels. Teaching the same material to such a diverse group is challenging. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we present a flipped-based approach that benefits from the mixed-ability nature of first-year programming courses rather than considering it as a burden. Secondly, we present a study that evaluates the extent to which the proposed approach enhances student learning in such a mixed-ability environment. The study was conducted in a first-year course at the University of British Columbia – Okanagan, and it was based on three components:1) a survey of 25 Likert items(n = 46), 2) class average grade and pass rate over 6 years (n = 42 + 38 + 56 + 79 + 90 + 74), and 3) student ratings of the course over 5 years (n = 42 + 38 + 56 + 79 + 90). Findings of the survey indicate an overall positive students’ impression with no significant difference in the opinions of various student populations. Analyzing the course grades, pass rates, and student ratings confirmed the survey findings and showed an overall improvement in grades, pass-rates, and student satisfaction.","authors":["Abdallah Mohamed"],"meta":["July 2021Education and Information Technologies","DOI:10.1007/s10639-021-10546-8"],"references":["317420832_Improving_student_learning_in_an_introductory_programming_course_using_flipped_classroom_and_competency_framework","312056149_Flipped_Classroom_with_Problem_Based_Activities_Exploring_Self-regulated_Learning_in_a_Programming_Language_Course","304900887_The_Flipped_Classroom_Method_Lessons_Learned_from_Flipping_Two_Programming_Courses","341869924_Evaluating_the_Effectiveness_of_Flipped_Teaching_in_a_Mixed-Ability_CS1_Course","333136077_Designing_a_CS1_Programming_Course_for_a_Mixed-Ability_Class","323323677_Designing_an_Introductory_Programming_Course_to_Improve_Non-Majors'_Experiences","312484686_An_Experience_Report_of_Flipped_Classroom_Strategy_Implementation_for_Java_Programming_Course","308863039_Flipping_a_programming_course_The_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly","308826330_Applying_flipped_classroom_and_problem-based_learning_in_a_CS1_course","300410674_The_Application_of_Hybrid_Flipped_Classroom_in_the_Course_of_Java_Programming","285935974_The_flipped_classroom_A_survey_of_the_research","283096704_Flipped_Classroom_Strategies_for_CS_Education","269831669_Towards_a_Meta-modern_Paradigm_of_Curriculum_Transcendence_of_a_Mistaken_Reliance_on_Theory","297890807_The_'More_Capable_Peer'_Approaches_to_Collaborative_Learning_in_a_Mixed-Ability_Classroom","285340461_Think-pair-share_An_expanding_teaching_technique"]}
