{"id":"41667703_Theoretical_Foundations_of_the_Web_Cognition_Communication_and_Co-Operation_Towards_an_Understanding_of_Web_10_20_30","abstract":"Currently, there is much talk of Web 2.0 and Social Software. A common understanding of these notions is not yet in existence. The question of what makes Social Software social has thus far also remained unacknowledged. In this paper we provide a theoretical understanding of these notions by outlining a model of the Web as a techno-social system that enhances human cognition towards communication and co-operation. According to this understanding, we identify three qualities of the Web, namely Web 1.0 as a Web of cognition, Web 2.0 as a Web of human communication, and Web 3.0 as a Web of co-operation. We use the terms Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0 not in a technical sense, but for describing and characterizing the social dynamics and information processes that are part of the Internet.","authors":["Christian Fuchs","Wolfgang Hofkirchner","Schafranek Matthias","Raffl Celina"],"meta":["March 2010Future Internet 2(1)","DOI:10.3390/fi2010041"],"references":["257141289_The_Social_Construction_of_Facts_and_Artifacts_Or_How_the_Sociology_of_Science_and_the_Sociology_of_Technology_Might_Benefit_Each_Other","314566111_Social_Construction_of_Technology","313743499_The_significance_of_social_software","286021030_Internet_and_Society_Social_Theory_in_the_Information_Age","259255495_The_Rules_of_Sociological_Method","254972471_Social_Software_Facilitating_information-_identity-_and_relationship_management","247478802_The_managed_web_A_look_at_the_impact_of_Web_20_on_media_asset_management_for_the_enterprise","239397415_Self-organization_knowledge_and_responsibility","236768776_Internet_and_Society_Social_Theory_in_the_Information_Age_review","233869963_The_Constitution_of_Society_Outline_of_The_Theory_of_Structuration"]}
