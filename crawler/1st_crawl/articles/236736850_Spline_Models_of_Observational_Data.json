{"id":"236736850_Spline_Models_of_Observational_Data","abstract":"This monograph is based on a series of 10 lectures at Ohio State University at Columbus, March 23â€“27, 1987, sponsored by the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences and the National Science Foundation. The selection of topics is quite personal and, together with the talks of the other speakers, the lectures represent a story, as I saw it in March 1987, of many of the interesting things that statisticians can do with splines. I told the audience that the priority order for topic selection was, first, obscure work of my own and collaborators, second, other work by myself and students, with important work by other speakers deliberately omitted in the hope that they would mention it themselves. This monograph will more or less follow that outline, so that it is very much slanted toward work I had some hand in, although I will try to mention at least by reference important work by the other speakers and some of the attendees. The other speakers were (in alphabetical order), Dennis Cox, Randy Eubank, Ker-Chau Li, Douglas Nychka, David Scott, Bernard Silverman, Paul Speckman, and James Wendelberger. The work of Finbarr O'Sullivan, who was unable to attend, in extending the developing theory to the non-Gaussian and nonlinear case will also play a central role, as will the work of Florencio Utreras.","authors":["G Wahba"],"meta":["January 1990","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611970128","Publisher: SIAM"],"references":[]}
