{"id":"282621487_A_complexity_and_approximation_framework_for_the_maximization_scaffolding_problem","abstract":"We explore in this paper some complexity issues inspired by the contig scaffolding problem in bioinformatics. We focus on the following problem: given an undirected graph with no loop, and a perfect matching on this graph, find a set of cycles and paths covering every vertex of the graph, with edges alternatively in the matching and outside the matching, and satisfying a given constraint on the numbers of cycles and paths. We show that this problem is -complete, even in planar bipartite graphs. Moreover, we show that there is no subexponential-time algorithm for several related problems unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. Lastly, we also design two polynomial-time approximation algorithms for complete graphs.","authors":["Annie Chateau","Rodolphe Giroudeau"],"meta":["August 2015Theoretical Computer Science 595:92-106","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2015.06.023"],"references":["263166700_Ragout_-_A_reference-assisted_assembly_tool_for_bacterial_genomes","258252382_Chromosome-scale_scaffolding_of_de_novo_genome_assemblies_based_on_chromatin_interactions","239731673_Hypergraph_Covering_Problems_Motivated_by_Genome_Assembly_Questions","234010873_SCARPA_Scaffolding_reads_with_practical_algorithms","227656650_Approximation_algorithms_for_covering_a_graph_by_vertex-disjoint_paths_of_maximum_total_weight","223974044_GRASS_A_generic_algorithm_for_scaffolding_next-generation_sequencing_assemblies","220432214_The_greedy_path-merging_algorithm_for_Contig_Scaffolding","44798226_SOPRA_Scaffolding_algorithm_for_paired_reads_via_statistical_optimization","40846559_Phylogenetic_Comparative_Assembly","281920240_Complexity_and_Polynomial-Time_Approximation_Algorithms_around_the_Scaffolding_Problem","268072213_Lower_bounds_based_on_the_exponential_time_hypothesis","256694169_Covering_vertices_by_a_specified_number_of_disjoint_cycles_edges_and_isolated_vertices","242618679_An_efficient_implementation_of_Edmonds'_Algorithm_for_Maximum_Matching_on_Graphs","239344419_A_Short_Proof_of_the_Factor_Theorem_for_Finite_Graphs","234797068_Approximation_algorithms_and_hardness_results_for_cycle_packing_problems","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","223306606_On_the_k-path_partition_of_graphs","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222521916_On_the_complexity_of_k-SAT","221591249_Some_Simplified_NP-Complete_Problems","221512637_Partition_Into_Triangles_on_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","221369179_Exact_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems_A_Survey","220431428_An_Efficient_Implementation_of_Edmonds'_Algorithm_for_Maximum_Matching_on_Graphs","201976939_The_traveling_salesman_problem_A_guided_tour_of_combinatorial_optimization_Reprint","51653758_Opera_Reconstructing_Optimal_Genomic_Scaffolds_with_High-Throughput_Paired-End_Sequences"]}
