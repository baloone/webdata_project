{"id":"330034005_Optimizing_the_Behaviour_of_Web_Users_Through_Expectation_Maximization_Algorithm_and_Mixture_of_Normal_Distributions","abstract":"The proposed work is to analyse the user's behaviour in web access. Worldwide, the web users are browsing through different websites every second. Aim of this paper is to identify the behaviour of user's in a time bound using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters. A novel approach based on Mixture normal distribution is used to discuss the percentage of user along with web page frequency.
