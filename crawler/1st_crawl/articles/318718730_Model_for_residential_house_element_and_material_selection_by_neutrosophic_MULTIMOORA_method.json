{"id":"318718730_Model_for_residential_house_element_and_material_selection_by_neutrosophic_MULTIMOORA_method","abstract":"This article aims to create a theoretical evaluation model based on decision support methods for the residential house construction materials and elements selection. The research and analyses of most of the scientists are invoked on individual elements and materials of the building, which have an impact on different aspects of sustainability. Meanwhile, the integrated model covering all the key elements and materials of the single-family residential house has not been implemented. Thus, the problem of development of the general composite model of the element and material selection of single-family buildings is acute in many countries around the world.\nOur study assessed the specific technical parameters related to building materials: cost, thermal bridging, and load-bearing capacity, the outer material selection according to localisation, environmental performance, durability, weight. SWARA (Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) approach is applied to decision making to calculate the relative importance of the criteria. A single-valued neutrosophic set governs the proposed new extension of MULTIMOORA (Multiobjective Optimisation by Ratio Analysis Plus Full Multiplicative Form) method and allows to deal explicitly with the indeterminacy of the initial information. Our proposed new theoretical composite model for selection of elements, materials and other aspects of sustainability can be practically applied in creating the decision support system for the selection of single-family house elements and materials.","authors":["Edmundas Kazimieras Zavadskas","Romualdas Bausys","Birutė Juodagalvienė","Inga Garnyte-Sapranaviciene"],"meta":["September
