{"id":"265655095_Small_Ramsey_Numbers","abstract":"We present data which, to the best of our knowledge, include all known nontrivial values and bounds for specific graph, hypergraph and multicolor Ramsey numbers, where the avoided graphs are complete or complete without one edge. Many results pertaining to other more studied cases are also presented. We give references to all cited bounds and values, as well as to previous similar compilations. We do not attempt complete coverage of asymptotic behavior of Ramsey numbers, but concentrate on their specific values.","authors":["Stanislaw Radziszowski"],"meta":["January 1996The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 1"],"references":["303492579_Generalized_Ramsey_theory_for_graphs_II_Small_diagonal_numbers","291048898_Upper_bouds_for_Ramsey_numbers_r3_k","323740913_The_William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition","312713745_The_Ramsey_number_rK2K3K4_and_rK1C4K4","312656419_The_Ramsey_numbers_rK2_K3K4_and_rK1_C4K4","304910455_Generalized_ramsey_theory_for_graphs_III_Small_off-diagonal_numbers","303217791_Generalised_Ramsey_numbers_for_two_sets_of_cycles","285739611_Announcement_On_the_Ramsey_numbers_R_4_6_R_5_6_and_R_3_12","285519488_On_the_Ramsey_number_of_a_path_or_a_star_versus_W4_or_W5","284678693_Some_remarks_on_the_theory_of_graphs"]}
