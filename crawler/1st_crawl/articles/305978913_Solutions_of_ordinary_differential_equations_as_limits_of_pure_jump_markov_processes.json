{"id":"305978913_Solutions_of_ordinary_differential_equations_as_limits_of_pure_jump_markov_processes","abstract":"In a great variety of fields, e.g., biology, epidemic theory, physics, and chemistry, ordinary differential equations are used to give continuous deterministic models for dynamic processes which are actually discrete and random in their development. Perhaps the simplest example is the differential equation used to describe a number of processes including radioactive decay and population growth.","authors":["Thomas G.
