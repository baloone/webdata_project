{"id":"292232538_ON_THE_USE_OF_MULTIVARIATE_ANALYSIS_AN_OVERVIEW","abstract":"Statistics can be viewed as the mathematical science that allows inferences to be made regarding unknown and underlying structures from observed numerical data. For example, based on the data from 500 patients in a clinical drug trial, inferences are drawn as to the effect of that drug upon a general population. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the conceptual basis of multivariate statistical analysis with emphasis on examples arising from pharmaceutical research.","authors":["Allan R.
