{"id":"259822877_The_Teaching_Brain_and_the_End_of_the_Empty_Vessel","abstract":"I am excited to present this first installment of a new series in MBE that explores the teaching brain. The goal of the series is to facilitate a transition in the lens on teaching from an empty vessel to a phenomenon as dynamic, variable and context-dependent as learning. This transformation will likely push all of us to reevaluate our understanding and research on teaching. Over the coming year, each issue will provide several articles that seek to shed light on a different aspect of this burgeoning new area of research. This issue opens the series with a piece designed to lay out the conceptual framework and evidence base for a new way to think about teaching: the teaching brain. Next, Michael Chazan gives an archaeological grounding for the existence of teaching in the earliest ancestors of Homo sapiens. Sidney Strauss and Margalit Ziv then describes how teaching is a fundamental human cognitive ability. Together, these articles begin to create a paradigm shift in the definition of teaching. We look forward to an exciting journey.","authors":["Vanessa Rodriguez"],"meta":["September 2012Mind Brain and Education 6(4):177-185","DOI:10.1111/j.1751-228X.2012.01155.x"],"references":["282887950_Dynamic_Systems_and_the_Quest_for_Individual-Based_Models_of_Change_and_Development","262561012_Cultural_learning","232707014_Strauss_S_1993_Theories_of_learning_and_development_for_academics_and_educators_Educational_Psychologist_28_191-203","231950897_Cultural_Learning","230218177_Specificity_of_gaze-following_in_young_chimpanzees","229800773_Dynamic_Development_of_Action_and_Thought","229397251_Children's_understanding_of_teaching_The_role_of_knowledge_and_belief","228332491_Rest_Is_Not_Idleness_Implications_of_the_Brain's_Default_Mode_for_Human_Development_and_Education","227624589_We_Feel_Therefore_We_Learn_The_Relevance_of_Affective_and_Social_Neuroscience_to_Education","334062672_The_Cultural_Origins_of_Human_Cognition","328737174_Theory_of_mind_in_nonhuman_primates","318494453_Metaphors_We_Live_By","315118412_Brain-Based_Visual_Learning","313605448_Why_animals_lack_pedagogy_and_some_cultures_have_more_of_it_than_others","313180409_Teachers'_thought_processes","312386996_The_bioecological_model_of_human_development","298157636_Growth_Cycles_of_Brain_and_Mind","292567399_The_educated_brain_Essays_in_neuroeducation","289882772_Webs_of_Skills_How_students_learn","289065638_Pedagogy_and_Aesthetics_as_Sources_of_Culture","275754617_The_Teacher_Theory_and_Practice_in_Teacher_Education","273230160_Schoolteacher_A_Sociological_Study","272552349_Chapter_4_Personal_Practical_Knowledge_A_Study_of_Teachers'_Classroom_Images","269519853_Pedagogy_of_The_Oppressed","265459431_Dynamics--the_geometry_of_behavior","263654044_Wild_Minds_What_Animals_Really_Think","257946641_Let_the_Questions_Be_Your_Guide_MBE_as_Interdisciplinary_Science","254090166_Book_Review_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives_The_Classification_of_Educational_Goals_Handbook_I_Cognitive_Domain","249704000_The_Study_of_Teacher_Thinking_Implications_for_Teacher_Education","248437976_Why_animals_have_neither_culture_nor_history","247699111_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives_The_Classification_of_Educational_Objectives","242271492_Do_stages_belong_at_the_center_of_developmental_theory_A_commentary_on_Piaget's_stages","239856481_Focus_on_variability_New_tools_to_study_intra-individual","239666682_Teacher_thinking_A_study_of_practical_knowledge","239062898_How_Do_Teachers_Manage_to_Teach_Perspectives_on_Problems_in_Practice","238105499_14_Teaching_As_a_Natural_Cognitive_Ability_Implications_for_Classroom_Practice_and_Teacher_Education","235752074_Experimental_evidence_for_teaching_in_wild_pied_babblers","234837338_Stages_and_Individual_Differences_in_Cognitive_Development","234743961_Mind_Brain_and_Education_Building_a_Scientific_Groundwork_for_Learning_and_Teaching","234727574_Personal_Practical_Knowledge_at_Bay_Street_School","234606465_The_Widget_Effect_Our_National_Failure_to_Acknowledge_and_Act_on_Differences_in_Teacher_Effectiveness","233820686_Is_There_Teaching_in_Nonhuman_Animals","232987045_Routines_in_Teacher_Planning","232868378_On_Becoming_a_Tutor_Toward_an_Ontogenetic_Model","232577482_Toward_a_More_Effective_Model_of_Research_on_Teaching","231914133_Style_Language_Variation_and_Identity_By_Nikolas_Coupland_Cambridge_Cambridge_University_Press_2007_Pp_224_Paperback_Hardcover_45","229917767_Brain_Science_of_Ethics_Present_Status_and_the_Future","229703039_The_Developing_Person_An_Experiential_Perspective","228003224_The_Bioecological_Model_of_Human_Development","227702661_The_Teaching_Brain","224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience","222668972_Teaching_as_a_natural_cognition_and_its_relations_to_preschoolers'_developing_theory_of_mind","222554934_The_Evolution_of_Teaching","222661523_Explaining_after_by_before_Basic_aspects_of_a_dynamic_systems_approach_to_the_study_of_development","222555287_Focus_on_variability_New_tools_to_study_intra-individual_variability_in_developmental_data"]}
