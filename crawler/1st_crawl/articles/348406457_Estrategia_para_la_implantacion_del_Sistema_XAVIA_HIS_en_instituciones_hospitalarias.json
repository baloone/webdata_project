The implement success of the system is of great importance for CESIM, however, this stage have been affected by a set of insufficiencies. The objective of the research is to develop a strategy that contributes to increasing success in defining the scope of projects to implement XAVIA HIS system in health institutions. A descriptive study was carried out, which included as an application scenario the National Center for Minimally Access Surgery, between 2015 and 2017. As a result, a strategy to implement XAVIA HIS system in health institutions was obtained, which positively impacts the decrease of time necessary for this purpose.","authors":["Maylevis Morejón Valdés","José Felipe Ramírez Pérez","Armando Pérez Fuentes","Alicia del Rosario Ramírez Pérez"],"meta":["June 2020"],"references":["325419875_Usability_Evaluation_of_Three_Admission_and_Medical_Records_Subsystems_Integrated_into_Nationwide_Hospital_Information_Systems_Heuristic_Evaluation","320933711_The_Critical_Success_Factors_CSFs_for_IT_Projects","311974182_PMBOK_y_PRINCE_2_similitudes_y_diferencias","327917807_Expanding_the_Knowledge_on_Project_Management_Standards_A_Look_into_the_PMBOKR_with_Dynamic_Lenses_AEIPRO_2017","319971167_Identificacion_de_factores_que_permitan_potencializar_el_exito_de_proyectos_de_desarrollo_de_software","308908994_A_literature_review_for_large-scale_health_information_system_project_planning_implementation_and_evaluation","290496770_The_challenges_of_human_factors_for_implementation_of_information_systems_in_the_healthcare","267814367_Prioritizing_Barriers_to_Successful_Implementation_of_Hospital_Information_Systems","262668753_Informatica_en_la_salud_publica_cubana"]}
