{"id":"327401134_OpenSimulator_based_Multi-User_Virtual_World_A_Framework_for_the_Creation_of_Distant_and_Virtual_Practical_Activities","abstract":"The exponential growth of technology has contributed to the positive revolution of distance learning. E-learning is becoming increasingly used in the transfer of knowledge where instructors can model and script their courses in several formats such as files, videos and quizzes. In order to complete their courses, practical activities are very important. Several instructors have joined Multi-User Virtual World (MUVW) communities such as SecondeLife, as they offer a degree of interrelated realism and interaction between users. The modeling and scenarization of practical activities in the MUVWs remains a very difficult task considering the technologies used by these MUVWs and the necessary prerequisites. In this paper, we propose a framework for the OpenSimulator MUVWs that can simplify the scenarization of practical activities using the OpenSpace3D software and without requiring designers to have expertise in programming or coding.
