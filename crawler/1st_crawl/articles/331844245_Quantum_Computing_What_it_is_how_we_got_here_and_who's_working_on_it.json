{"id":"331844245_Quantum_Computing_What_it_is_how_we_got_here_and_who's_working_on_it","abstract":"Quantum computing is a new and exciting field that intersects mathematics, computer science and physics. Computer systems built on the principles of quantum mechanics are capable of performing calculations deemed unachievable for classical computers. This paper provides an overview and history of quantum computing, discusses its algorithmic mechanisms, and explores its implications for cryptography, innovation, power structures, and day-to-day life.","authors":["Miriam Haart","Charlie Hoffs"],"meta":["March 2019"],"references":["1758552_An_Introduction_to_Quantum_Computing","351395547_Quantum_technology_applications_of_exciton-polariton_condensates"]}
