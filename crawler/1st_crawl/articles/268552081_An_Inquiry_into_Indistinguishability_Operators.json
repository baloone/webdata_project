{"id":"268552081_An_Inquiry_into_Indistinguishability_Operators","abstract":"Discerning objects in a theory is an essential problem. Quine (1981) has said “There is no entity without identity”. The problem of individuation is a long-standing phi1osophical preoccupation (Munitz,1971); because though things are, themselves, what they are, a human or artificial observer aided by intelligence or instruments “reads” things and sees in them just what can be seen, what the discriminating power of the instrument allows, this being true for physical as well as intellectual instruments.","authors":["Enric Trillas","L.
