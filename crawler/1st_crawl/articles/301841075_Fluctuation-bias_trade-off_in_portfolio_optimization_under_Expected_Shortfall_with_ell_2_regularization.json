{"id":"301841075_Fluctuation-bias_trade-off_in_portfolio_optimization_under_Expected_Shortfall_with_ell_2_regularization","abstract":"The optimization of a large random portfolio under the Expected Shortfall risk measure with an $\\ell_2$ regularizer is carried out by analytical calculation. The regularizer reins in the large sample fluctuations and the concomitant divergent estimation error, and eliminates the phase transition where this error would otherwise blow up. In the data-dominated region, where the number of different assets in the portfolio is much less than the length of the available time series, the regularizer plays a negligible role, while in the (much more frequently occurring in practice) opposite limit, where the samples are comparable or even small compared to the number of different assets, the optimum is almost entirely determined by the regularizer. Our results clearly show that the transition region between these two extremes is relatively narrow, and it is only here that one can meaningfully speak of a trade-off between fluctuations and bias.","authors":["GÃ¡bor Papp","Fabio Caccioli","Imre Kondor"],"meta":["February 2016","Project: econophysics"],"references":["282997122_Portfolio_Optimization_under_Expected_Shortfall_Contour_Maps_of_Estimation_Error","238979387_Universal_and_Nonuniversal_Properties_of_Cross_Correlations_in_Financial_Time_Series","227587347_Risk_Minimization_through_Portfolio_Replication","261673349_L_p_regularized_portfolio_optimization","257218808_Portfolios_with_nonlinear_constraints_and_spin_glasses","236736787_Statistics_for_High-Dimensional_Data_Method_Theory_and_Applications","233822065_Spin_Glass_Theory_and_Beyond","230918920_The_instability_of_downside_risk_measures","228609755_Optimization_of_Conditional_Value-At-Risk","227406020_An_Empirical_Bayes_Approach_to_Efficient_Portfolio_Selection"]}
