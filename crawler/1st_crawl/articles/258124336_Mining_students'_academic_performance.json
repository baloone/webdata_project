{"id":"258124336_Mining_students'_academic_performance","abstract":"Data Mining techniques are widely used in educational field to find new hidden patterns from student’s data. The hidden patterns that are discovered can be used to understand the problem arise in the educational field. This paper surveys the three elements needed to make prediction on Students’ Academic Performances which are parameters, methods and tools. This paper also proposes a framework for predicting the performance of first year bachelor students in computer science course. Naïve Bayes Classifier is used to extract patterns using the Data Mining Weka tool. The framework can be used as a basis for the system implementation and prediction of Students’ Academic Performance in Higher Learning Institutions.","authors":["Azwa Abdul Aziz","Nur Hafieza Ismail","Fadhilah Ahmad"],"meta":["July 2013Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology 53(3):485-495","Project: Talent Data Warehouse"],"references":["290488107_Prediction_of_student_academic_performance_by_an_application_of_data_mining_techniques","264841908_Data_Mining_System_and_Applications_A_Review","254044494_Proposed_academic_students'_performance_prediction_model_A_Malaysian_case_study","252963526_Identifying_Key_Performance_Indicators_and_Predicting_the_Result_from_Student_Data","285852296_Data_mining_for_education","285476716_A_Data_Mining_Model_for_Predicting_Computer_Programming_Proficiency_of_Computer_Science_Undergraduate_Students","270554452_Data_Mining_for_Engineering_Schools","263842523_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Technique","261212550_Application_of_data_mining_in_educational_databases_for_predicting_academic_trends_and_patterns","261073006_Model_Prediction_of_Academic_Performance_for_First_Year_Students"]}
