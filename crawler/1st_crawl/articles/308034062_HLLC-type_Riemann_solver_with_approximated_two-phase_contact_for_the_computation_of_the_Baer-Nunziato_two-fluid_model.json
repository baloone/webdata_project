{"id":"308034062_HLLC-type_Riemann_solver_with_approximated_two-phase_contact_for_the_computation_of_the_Baer-Nunziato_two-fluid_model","abstract":"The computation of compressible two-phase flows with the Baer-Nunziato model is addressed.\nOnly the convective part of the model that exhibits non-conservative products is considered and\nthe source terms of the model that represent the exchange between phases are neglected. Based\non the solver proposed by Tokareva & Toro [42], a new HLLC-type Riemann solver is built. The\nkey idea of this new solver lies in an approximation of the two-phase contact discontinuity of the\nmodel. Thus the Riemann invariants of the wave are approximated in the “subsonic” case. A\nmajor consequence of this approximation is that the resulting solver can deal with any Equation\nof State. It also allows to bypass the resolution of a non-linear equation based on those Riemann\ninvariants. We assess the solver and compare it with others on 1D Riemann problems including\ngrid convergence and efficiency studies. The ability of the proposed solver to deal with complex\nEquations Of State is also investigated. Finally, the different solvers have been compared on\nchallenging 2D test-cases due to the presence of both material interfaces and shock waves: a\nshock-bubble interaction and underwater explosions. When compared with others, the present\nsolver appears to be accurate, efficient and robust.","authors":["Hippolyte Lochon","Frédéric Daude","Pascal Galon","Jean-Marc Hérard"],"meta":["December 2016Journal of Computational Physics 326:733-762","DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2016.09.015","Projects: Multiphase flow models and associated numerical schemesDevelopment in the fast transient dynamics code Europlexus."],"references":["301873958_A_Positive_and_Entropy-Satisfying_Finite_Volume_Scheme_for_the_Baer-Nunziato_Model","290998226_On_Upstream_Differencing_and_Godunov-Type_Schemes_for_Hyperbolic_Conservation_Laws","289433747_Comparison_of_two-fluid_models_on_steam-water_transients","282599936_Closure_Conditions_for_Non-Equilibrium_Multi-Component_Models","267896669_Validation_of_a_two-fluid_model_on_unsteady_liquid-vapor_water_flows","311612116_A_comparative_study_of_numerical_schemes_for_the_Baer-Nunziato_model","283285631_On_the_computation_of_the_Baer-Nunziato_model_using_ALE_formulation_with_HLL-_and_HLLC-type_solvers_towards_fluid-structure_interactions","280491886_A_GPU_based_compressible_multiphase_hydrocode_for_modelling_violent_hydrodynamic_impact_problems","272102223_A_simple_HLLC-type_Riemann_solver_for_compressible_non-equilibrium_two-phase_flows","268648918_De_nition_and_weak_stability_of_nonconservative_products"]}
