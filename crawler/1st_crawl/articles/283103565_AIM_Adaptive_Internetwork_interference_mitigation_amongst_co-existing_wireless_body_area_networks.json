{"id":"283103565_AIM_Adaptive_Internetwork_interference_mitigation_amongst_co-existing_wireless_body_area_networks","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel adaptive internetwork interference mitigation scheme, namely AIM, for environments with multiple coexisting Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The proposed scheme, operating on a nodes' traffic priority, packet length, signal strength and density of sensors in a WBAN, makes three major contributions as compared to the current literature. Firstly, it considers node-level interference for internetwork interference mitigation rather than considering each WBAN as a whole. Secondly, it allocates synchronous and parallel transmission intervals for interference avoidance in an optimal manner. Finally, it significantly reduces the number of orthogonal channels assigned to achieve a higher throughput as well as better usage of the scarce limitation of resources in WBANs. Simulation results show that our protocol achieves a significantly higher spatial reuse compared to existing approaches for interference mitigation in WBANs.","authors":["Samaneh Movassaghi","Mehran Abolhasan","David Smith","Abbas Jamalipour"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037177"],"references":["264582616_Interference_Mitigation_for_Cyber-Physical_Wireless_Body_Area_Network_System_Using_Social_Networks","260518614_Smart_Spectrum_Allocation_for_Interference_Mitigation_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","259005723_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_A_Survey","221287910_Distributed_Inter-Network_Interference_Coordination_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","260518313_Cooperative_Scheduling_with_Graph_Coloring_for_Interference_Mitigation_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","260358194_Coloring-Based_Inter-WBAN_Scheduling_for_Mobile_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","257811661_Cooperative_body-area-communications_Enhancing_coexistence_without_coordination_between_networks","257666500_Asynchronous_Inter-Network_Interference_Avoidance_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","241623499_A_game_theory_model_to_support_QoS_in_overlapped_WBAN_environment","224204630_Inter-network_interference_mitigation_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_using_power_control_games","224154703_Performance_of_Piconet_Co-Existence_Schemes_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","221575299_Interference_mitigation_for_body_area_networks","221287527_Interference_Analysis_of_Co-Existing_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks"]}
