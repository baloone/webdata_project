{"id":"323241700_Investigating_Tertiary_Level_EFL_Learners'_Willingness_to_Communicate_in_English","abstract":"The present study aimed to investigate Turkish EFL learners’ perceived levels of willingness to communicate (WTC) in English inside and outside the classroom. The study also aimed to explore whether there is a statistically significant difference between their in-class WTC in English and out-of-class WTC in English. The study, which employed a quantitative research design, was conducted with the participation of 701 EFL learners enrolled in the departments of Tourism Guidance and Tourism Management at Balıkesir University Faculty of Tourism located in Balıkesir, Turkey. The data collection instrument included a scale which measures the participants’ perceived levels of WTC in English. The data were analyzed descriptively through IBM SPSS 21. The findings of the study indicated that EFL learners have a moderate level of WTC in English. The findings also showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the participants’ perceived levels of their in-class WTC in English and their out-of-class WTC in English. It was found that they are more willing to communicate in English outside the classroom than they are inside the classroom. In the light of the findings, some practical recommendations were also noted.","authors":["Tutku başöz","Ismail hakkı Erten"],"meta":["February 2018English Language Teaching 11(3):78","DOI:10.5539/elt.v11n3p78"],"references":["327738659_The_Influence_of_Ideal_L2_self_Academic_Self-_Concept_and_Intercultural_Communicative_Competence_on_Willingness_to_Communicate_in_a_Foreign_Language","319188019_The_Relationship_between_Ideal_L2_Self_and_Willingness_to_Communicate_Inside_the_Classroom","309322124_Willingness_to_Communicate_of_Foreign_Language_Learners_in_Turkish_Context","346531315_An_Introduction_to_Rhetorical_Communication","320013292_The_Effectiveness_of_Using_Films_in_the_EFL_Classroom_A_Case_Study_Conducted_at_an_International_University_in_Thailand","313759314_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences_Plenum_New_York_43_Storch_EA_Larson_MJ_Muroff_J_Caporino_N_Geller_D_Reid_JM_et_al_2010_Predictors_of_functional_impairment_in_pediatric_obsessive","313172357_Willingness_to_communicate_a_cognitive_view","313103541_Input_and_second_language_acquisition_theory","312341524_Individual_differences_in_second_language_learning","304556454_Korean_University_Students'_Willingness_to_Communicate"]}
