{"id":"292283656_Scheduling_Jobs_with_Equal_Processing_Times_on_a_Single_Machine_Minimizing_Maximum_Lateness_and_Makespan","abstract":"The following special case of the classical NP-hard scheduling problem \\(1|r_j|L_{\\max }\\) is considered. There is a set of jobs \\(N= \\{ 1, 2, \\ldots , n \\}\\) with identical processing times \\(p_j=p\\) for all jobs \\(j \\in N\\). All jobs have to be processed on a single machine. The optimization criterion is the minimization of maximum lateness \\(L_{\\max }\\). We analyze algorithms for the makespan problem \\(1|r_j|C_{\\max }\\), presented by Garey et al. (SIAM J Comput 10(2):256–269, 1981), Simons (A fast algorithm for single processor scheduling. In: 19th Annual symposium on foundations of computer science (Ann Arbor, Mich., 1978, 1978) and Benson’s algorithm (J Glob Optim 13(1):1–24, 1998) and give two polynomial algorithms to solve the problem under consideration and to construct the Pareto set with respect to the criteria \\(L_{\\max }\\) and \\(C_{\\max }\\). The complexity of the presented algorithms is \\(O(Q \\cdot n \\log n )\\) and \\(O(n^3 \\log n)\\), respectively, where \\(10^{-Q}\\) is the accuracy of the input-output parameters.","authors":["Alexander Lazarev","Dmitry I Arkhipov","Frank Werner"],"meta":["January 2017Optimization Letters 11(1):13 pages","DOI:10.1007/s11590-016-1003-y"],"references":["235981636_Parallel_Machine_Problems_with_Equal_Processing_Times","226403566_The_pareto-optimal_set_of_the_NP-hard_problem_of_minimization_of_the_maximum_lateness_for_a_single_machine","225233863_An_Outer_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Generating_All_Efficient_Extreme_Points_in_the_Outcome_Set_of_a_Multiple_Objective_Linear_Programming_Problem","220366387_Parallel_machine_problems_with_equal_processing_times_A_survey","220616798_Scheduling_Unit-Time_Tasks_with_Arbitrary_Release_Times_and_Deadlines","220568176_On_a_parallel_machine_scheduling_problem_with_equal_processing_times","4354777_A_fast_algorithm_for_single_processor_scheduling"]}
