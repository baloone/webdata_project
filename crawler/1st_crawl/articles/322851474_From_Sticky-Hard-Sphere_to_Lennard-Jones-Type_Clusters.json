{"id":"322851474_From_Sticky-Hard-Sphere_to_Lennard-Jones-Type_Clusters","abstract":"A relation $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{SHS}\\to\\mathrm{LJ}}$ between the set of non-isomorphic sticky hard sphere clusters $\\mathcal{M}_\\mathrm{SHS}$ and the sets of local energy minima $\\mathcal{M}_{LJ}$ of the $(m,n)$-Lennard-Jones potential $V^\\mathrm{LJ}_{mn}(r) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{n-m} [ m r^{-n} - n r^{-m} ]$ is established. The number of nonisomorphic stable clusters depends strongly and nontrivially on both $m$ and $n$, and increases exponentially with increasing cluster size $N$ for $N \\gtrsim 10$. While the map from $\\mathcal{M}_\\mathrm{SHS}\\to \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{SHS}\\to\\mathrm{LJ}}$ is non-injective and non-surjective, the number of Lennard-Jones structures missing from the map is relatively small for cluster sizes up to $N=13$, and most of the missing structures correspond to energetically unfavourable minima even for fairly low $(m,n)$. Furthermore, even the softest Lennard-Jones potential predicts that the coordination of 13 spheres around a central sphere is problematic (the Gregory-Newton problem). A more realistic extended Lennard-Jones potential chosen from coupled-cluster calculations for a rare gas dimer leads to a substantial increase in the number of nonisomorphic clusters, even though the potential curve is very similar to a (6,12)-Lennard-Jones potential.","authors":["Lukas Trombach","Robert S.
