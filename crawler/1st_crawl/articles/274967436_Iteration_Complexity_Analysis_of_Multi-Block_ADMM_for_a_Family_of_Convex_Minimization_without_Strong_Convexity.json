{"id":"274967436_Iteration_Complexity_Analysis_of_Multi-Block_ADMM_for_a_Family_of_Convex_Minimization_without_Strong_Convexity","abstract":"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used in solving structured convex optimization problems due to its superior practical performance. On the theoretical side however, a counterexample was shown in Chen et al. (Math Program 155(1):57–79, 2016.) indicating that the multi-block ADMM for minimizing the sum of N\n\\((N\\ge 3)\\) convex functions with N block variables linked by linear constraints may diverge. It is therefore of great interest to investigate further sufficient conditions on the input side which can guarantee convergence for the multi-block ADMM. The existing results typically require the strong convexity on parts of the objective. In this paper, we provide two different ways related to multi-block ADMM that can find an \\(\\epsilon \\)-optimal solution and do not require strong convexity of the objective function. Specifically, we prove the following two results: (1) the multi-block ADMM returns an \\(\\epsilon \\)-optimal solution within \\(O(1/\\epsilon ^2)\\) iterations by solving an associated perturbation to the original problem; this case can be seen as using multi-block ADMM to solve a modified problem; (2) the multi-block ADMM returns an \\(\\epsilon \\)-optimal solution within \\(O(1/\\epsilon )\\) iterations when it is applied to solve a certain sharing problem, under the condition that the augmented Lagrangian function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property, which essentially covers most convex optimization models except for some pathological cases; this case can be seen as applying multi-block ADMM to solving a special class of problems.","authors":["Tianyi Lin","Shiqian Ma","Shuzhong Zhang"],"meta":["October 2016Journal of Scientific Computing 69(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-016-0182-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["310517600_Parallel_Multi-Block_ADMM_with_o1_k_Convergence","305692934_On_the_convergence_of_the_direct_extension_of_ADMM_for_three-block_separable_convex_minimization_models_with_one_strongly_convex_function","284160173_On_Full_Jacobian_Decomposition_of_the_Augmented_Lagrangian_Method_for_Separable_Convex_Programming","313454247_Convergence_Rate_Analysis_for_the_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers_with_a_Substitution_Procedure_for_Separable_Convex_Programming","308838169_Convergence_analysis_of_alternating_direction_method_of_multipliers_for_a_family_of_nonconvex_problems","308168354_On_the_numerical_solution_of_heat_conduction_problems_in_two_and_three_space_variables","304533564_Applications_of_the_method_of_multipliers_to_variational_inequalities","304496881_The_numerical_solution_of_parabolic_and_elliptic_numerical_differential_equations","289988636_UNDERSTANDING_THE_CONVERGENCE_OF_THE_ALTERNATING_DIRECTION_METHOD_OF_MULTIPLIERS_THEORETICAL_AND_COMPUTATIONAL_PERSPECTIVES","285677677_Augmented_Lagrangian_Methods_Applications_to_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Boundary-Value_Problems"]}
