{"id":"265328692_Evaluating_Effectiveness_of_Pair_Programming_as_a_Teaching_Tool_in_Programming_Courses","abstract":"This study investigates the effectiveness of pair programming on student learning and satisfaction in introductory programming courses. Pair programming, used in the industry as a practice of an agile development method, can be adopted in classroom settings to encourage peer learning, increase students’ social skills, and enhance student achievement. This study explored students’ perceptions on effectiveness of pair programming and the influence of student’s level of experience with this activity and perceived partner involvement on effectiveness outcomes. Findings suggest that the more students are involved in this activity, the more they enjoy it and the more they learn by collaborating with their partners. When comparing different effectiveness measures, their perceived learning, quality of work, and enjoyment during pair programming was found to be at a higher level than increased productivity outcome.","authors":["Silvana Faja"],"meta":["January 2014Information Systems Education Journal 12(6):36-44"],"references":[]}
