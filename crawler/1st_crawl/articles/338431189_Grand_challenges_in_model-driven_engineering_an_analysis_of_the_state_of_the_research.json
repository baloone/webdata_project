{"id":"338431189_Grand_challenges_in_model-driven_engineering_an_analysis_of_the_state_of_the_research","abstract":"In 2017 and 2018, two events were held—in Marburg, Germany, and San Vigilio di Marebbe, Italy, respectively—focusing on an analysis of the state of research, state of practice, and state of the art in model-driven engineering (MDE). The events brought together experts from industry, academia, and the open-source community to assess what has changed in research in MDE over the last 10 years, what challenges remain, and what new challenges have arisen. This article reports on the results of those meetings, and presents a set of grand challenges that emerged from discussions and synthesis. These challenges could lead to research initiatives for the community going forward.","authors":["Antonio Bucchiarone","Jordi Cabot","Richard F.
