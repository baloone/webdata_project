{"id":"319476033_Stability_and_change_in_personality_and_personality_disorders","abstract":"In this paper, we review recent findings related to stability and change in personality and personality disorder. Estimates of stability vary depending on a number of methodological and substantive factors. These factors include the type of stability being examined, the type of construct being assessed, the method being used to assess personality, how participants are sampled, and developmental trends in personality stability and change. We describe current evidence about personality stability with respect to each of these factors. We conclude that current gaps in the literature can be filled by more carefully attending to factors that impact estimates of stability and change, and provide recommendations about how future research can fill those gaps.","authors":["Christopher Hopwood","Wiebke Bleidorn"],"meta":["September 2017Current Opinion in Psychology
