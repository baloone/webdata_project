{"id":"225935337_The_CourseMarker_CBA_System_Improvements_over_Ceilidh","abstract":"This document reports on the results of re-designing and re-implementing the Ceilidh courseware system. It highlights the limitations identified in the thirteen years of Ceilidh's use at the University of Nottingham. It also illustrates how most of these limitations have been resolved by re-designing Ceilidh's architecture and improving various aspects of the marking and administrating processes. The new system, entitled CourseMarker, offers enhanced functionality by adding useful features that have long been needed by Ceilidh's community. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the changes and a brief report on the experience of CourseMarker's use over the last three years. Finally, recent developments and future directions are discussed.","authors":["Colin Anthony Higgins","Tarek Hegazy","Pavlos Symeonidis","Athanasios Tsintsifas"],"meta":["September 2003Education and Information Technologies 8(3):287-304","DOI:10.1023/A:1026364126982"],"references":["253818307_Computer_Based_Assessment_Volume1_A_guide_to_good_practice","305258688_Automated_Grading_Assistance_for_Student_Programs","242637363_Ceilidh_a_course_administration_and_marking_system","242525848_Courseware_to_support_the_teaching_of_programming","242524514_The_Ceilidh_System_A_General_Overview","242506085_A_course_administration_and_marking_system","242452085_Automatic_program_quality_assessment_system","242416861_Security_issues_under_ceilidh's_www_interface","238724162_The_Java_HotSpot_performance_engine_architecture","237104488_Experience_using_the_Ceilidh_system"]}
