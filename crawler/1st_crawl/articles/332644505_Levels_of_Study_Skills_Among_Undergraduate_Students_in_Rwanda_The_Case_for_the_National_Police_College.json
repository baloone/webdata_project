{"id":"332644505_Levels_of_Study_Skills_Among_Undergraduate_Students_in_Rwanda_The_Case_for_the_National_Police_College","abstract":"The present study contributes to the existing literature on higher education in post-conflict contexts. It seeks to investigate the extent to which the University of Rwanda (UR) undergraduate students at National Police College (NPC) are conversant with major components of study skills mainly time management, note taking, reading, writing, test preparation, and test taking skills. The present study follows a cross-sectional design and was conducted among 398 students. Results show that overall students are moderately conversant with concerned study skills. It is also found that in all programs of study (Professional Police Studies—PPS, Law, and Computer Science with the option of Information Security) students fare better in time management but have difficulties in test preparation skills. The study recommends that educational policy makers and university managers should develop adequate strategies for improving students’ skills at all levels. We argue that continued monitoring and reinforcement of students’ study skills is critical to the success of higher education in Rwanda.","authors":["Delphine Mukingambeho","Sylvestre Nzahabwanayo","Wenceslas Nzabalirwa","Gabriel Nizeyimana"],"meta":["May 2019Interchange 50(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10780-019-09361-5"],"references":["348560214_The_Effect_of_the_Time_Management_Skills_of_Students_Taking_a_Financial_Accounting_Course_on_their_Course_Grades_and_Grade_Point_Averages","348207908_Teaching_Test-Taking_Strategies_Importance_and_Techniques","338228825_The_Relationship_between_Time_Management_and_the_Academic_Performance_of_Students_from_the_Petroleum_Institute_in_Abu_Dhabi_the_UAE","332842948_Metacognition_and_Study_Skills_of_Arts_and_Science_College_students","328886497_Relationship_between_Study_Skills_and_Learning_Outcomes_Among_Nursing_Students_in_Selected_Schools_Of_Nursing_in_North_Western_Nigeria","326369111_Factors_affecting_the_Academic_performance_of_the_Indian_college_students_A_case_study","349860763_Academic_Writing_A_Handbook_for_International_Students","349396998_Note_Taking_and_Learning_A_Summary_of_Research","349161276_The_Effect_of_Study_Habits_on_English_Language_Achievement","345653816_Academic_Writing_A_Handbook_for_International_Students","318657029_Approaches_to_learning_as_predictors_of_academic_achievement_Results_from_a_large_scale_multi-level_analysis","313768789_The_Impact_of_Time_Management_on_the_Students'_Academic_Achievements","323983159_The_Effect_of_Study_Habits_on_English_Language_Achievement","314537998_Study_of_Impact_of_Time_Management_on_Academic_Performance_of_College_Students","292086471_Reading_Habits_Among_Students_and_its_Effect_on_Academic_Performance_A_Study_of_Students_of_Koforidua_Polytechnic"]}
