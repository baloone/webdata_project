{"id":"318420131_Computation_of_Shortest_Path_in_a_Vague_Network_by_Euclidean_Distance","abstract":"Theoretical concepts of graphs are highly utilized by computer scientists. Especially in research areas of computer science such as data mining, image segmentation, clustering image capturing, networking, etc.\nThe vague graphs are more flexible and compatible than fuzzy graphs due to the fact that they have many applications in networks.\nThis paper presents an algorithm to find the shortest path in\na directed graph whose arc length is taken as triangular vague number\ninstead of real number. Finally, an illustrative numerical example is\ngiven to demonstrate the proposed algorithm.","authors":["Ahmad Esfandiari","Hossein Rashmanlou","Sankar Sahoo","Rajabali Borzooei"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Multiple-valued Logic and Soft Computing 30(1)"],"references":["283070761_Product_vague_graphs_and_its_applications","281399313_Degree_of_vertices_in_vague_graphs","281336888_Domination_in_vague_graphs_and_its_applications","279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","292004369_Similar_relations_and_fuzzy_ordering","291629985_Semi_Global_Domination_Sets_in_Vague_Graphs_with_Application","287711963_Fuzzy_sets_information_and_control","282765879_More_Results_on_Vague_Graphs","265201014_Vague_Graphs"]}
