{"id":"300589039_MulDiRoH_An_Evaluation_of_Facial_Direction_Expression_in_Teleconferencing_on_a_Multi-view_Display_System","abstract":"We have developed a teleconference system called MulDiRoH (Multi-Directional Representation of Humans). It features the use of a QDA screen, one of the newest multi-view display techniques. A principal benefit of multi-view displays is they can show views of a remote participant from the direction in which the participant’s face is pointing. This enables other participants to directly see the face of a remote participant who is actually looking away from them. However, all multi-view display systems share a common problem in that users who stand outside of the center area cannot observe geometrically correct images. To addressthis problem, we propose the use of the perspective transform method. We also evaluate the conveying of a person’s facial direction by a communication game for multiple users.","authors":["Shiro Ozawa","Satoshi Mieda","Munekazu Date","Hideaki Takada"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-07731-4_52","Conference: International Conference on Human Interface and the Management of Information"],"references":["221572460_A_system_for_reconstructing_multiparty_conversation_field_based_on_augmented_head_motion_by_dynamic_projection","261525297_Multiple_Directional_Viewing_Projection_Display_Based_on_the_Incident-Angle-Independent_Diffusion-Angle-Quantizing_Technology","220183528_Achieving_Eye_Contact_in_a_One-to-Many_3D_Video_Teleconferencing_System"]}
