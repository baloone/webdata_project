Linguistics: morphology, semantics, and syntax are also presented as components of subtle computer science that form. A structure and an integrated data system. The presented useful theory of language is a new method to learn the language by separating the fields of semantics and syntax.</span","authors":["Adel Al-janabi","Ehsan Ali Kareem","Radhwan Hussein Abdulzhraa Al-Sagheer"],"meta":["May 2021Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 22(2):961"],"references":["346549292_Multi-lingual_Twitter_sentiment_analysis_using_machine_learning","343270197_A_preference_semantics_for_imperatives","339663348_Towards_optimize-ESA_for_text_semantic_similarity_A_case_study_of_biomedical_text","339140687_An_exploratory_research_on_grammar_checking_of_Bangla_sentences_using_statistical_language_models","333538318_Arabic_named_entity_recognition_using_deep_learning_approach","342236449_Semantics-Aware_BERT_for_Language_Understanding","339559002_Sequence_Level_Semantics_Aggregation_for_Video_Object_Detection","333914654_MORPHOLOGICAL_FEATURES_OF_DENTOFACIAL_AREA_IN_PEOPLE_WITH_DENTAL_ARCH_ISSUES_COMBINED_WITH_OCCLUSION_ANOMALIES","332897645_Distributional_Semantics_and_Linguistic_Theory","326747187_Recent_Trends_in_Deep_Learning_Based_Natural_Language_Processing_Review_Article","326731387_A_Novel_Hybrid_Classification_Approach_for_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Text_Document","318393489_Vocabulary_Knowledge_Predicts_Lexical_Processing_Evidence_from_a_Group_of_Participants_with_Diverse_Educational_Backgrounds","316473111_Assessing_Lebanese_bilingual_children_The_use_of_Cross-linguistic_Lexical_Tasks_in_Lebanese_Arabic","324504907_Morphology_and_Syntax","318742364_Modeling_Source_Syntax_for_Neural_Machine_Translation"]}
