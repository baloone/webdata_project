{"id":"351389769_Delay_dependent_criteria_for_the_consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_subject_to_communication_delay","abstract":"In this paper, a distributed controller is designed for the consensus of multi-agent systems in which each agent has a general second-order linear dynamic and the information is exchanged over a data-delaying communication network. Using the sensitivity of system poles to the parameters of the control protocol, graphical delay-dependent synthesis conditions are derived to tune the controller gains. A systematic procedure is developed to attain maximum tolerable transmission delay in the system. Moreover, simpler condition is provided for the special case where the second-order model is reduced to a double integrator. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the merits of the proposed scheme compared to some recent rival ones in the literature.","authors":["Amir Nejadvali","Reza Mahboobi Esfanjani","Arash Farnam","Guillaume Crevecoeur"],"meta":["May 2021IET Control Theory and Applications 15(10):1-10","DOI:10.1049/cth2.12154"],"references":["343593188_Consensus_Switching_of_Second-Order_Multiagent_Systems_With_Time_Delay","335583567_Sampled-position_states_based_consensus_of_networked_multi-agent_systems_with_second-order_dynamics_subject_to_communication_delays","335484287_Region-based_flocking_control_for_networked_robotic_systems_with_communication_delays","334450667_Stability_and_Stabilization_of_Time-Delay_Systems_An_eigenvalue_based_approach","322359590_Group_consensus_control_for_discrete-time_heterogeneous_first-_and_second-order_multi-agent_systems","312890364_Consensus_seeking_in_multi-agent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies","311962123_Stability_Analysis_of_Polynomially_Dependent_Systems_by_Eigenvalue_Perturbation","309883456_Consensus_conditions_for_general_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_communication_delay","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","282453701_Consensusability_of_linear_multi-agent_systems_with_time_delay","268248575_Stability_and_stabilization_of_time-delay_systems_An_eigenvalue_based_approach","260648143_Smart_Grid_Communication_Its_Challenges_and_Opportunities","260586809_Rendezvous_of_mobile_agents_with_constrained_energy_and_intermittent_communication","259993252_Consensusability_of_multi-agent_systems_with_time-varying_communication_delay","257388088_Consensus_of_Second-Order_Delayed_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Leader-Following"]}
