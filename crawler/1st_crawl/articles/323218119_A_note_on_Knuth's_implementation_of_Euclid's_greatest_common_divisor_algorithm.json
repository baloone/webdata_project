The reason of interest in this topic is widely application of this algorithm in various mathematics and computer science topics [13]. Particularly via Google you can see that there are more than 400 000 pages indexed for keyword 'greatest common divisor'. In our implementation we reduce the number of iterations and now they are 50% of Knuth's realization of Euclid's GCD. For all algorithms we have use the implementations in Visual C# 2017 programming environment.","authors":["Anton Iliev","Nikolay Kyurkchiev"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 117(4):603-608","DOI:10.12732/ijpam.v117i4.5"],"references":["343685518_Generalization_and_Optimization_of_Some_Algorithms","242730048_Factoring_a_Polynomial_with_Multiple-Roots","226669509_A_new_method_for_computing_polynomial_greates_common_divisors_and_polynomial_remainder_sequences","274813380_Factorization_and_Primality_Testing","266918685_A_practical_guide_to_data_structures_and_algorithms_using_Java_With_CD-ROM"]}
