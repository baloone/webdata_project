It can simulate certain human thinking processes and social behaviors. In the past 20 years, the application of artificial intelligence has penetrated into many areas of life and production, including economics, space technology, active control, computer planning, and mechanical manufacturing. It has produced huge economic benefits in production practices and pushed human society forward by a huge step. With the increasing research and development of artificial intelligence technology, its application in mechanical engineering has become more and more extensive. Through its high-end technology and intelligent algorithms, it can effectively and accurately solve various problems in the process of mechanical automation experimental research and production use. This article will analyze and research the application of artificial intelligence in the field of mechanical automation.","authors":["Wanling Li","Fanzhao Meng"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1885(4):042015","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1885/4/042015"],"references":[]}
