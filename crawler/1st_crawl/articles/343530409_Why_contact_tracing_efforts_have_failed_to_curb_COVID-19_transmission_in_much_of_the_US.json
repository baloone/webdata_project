{"id":"343530409_Why_contact_tracing_efforts_have_failed_to_curb_COVID-19_transmission_in_much_of_the_US","abstract":"By late April 2020, public discourse in the U.S. had shifted toward the idea of using more targeted case-based mitigation tactics (e.g., contact tracing) to combat COVID-19 transmission while allowing for the safe \"re-opening\" of society, in an effort to reduce the social, economic, and political ramifications associated with stricter approaches. Expanded tracing-testing efforts were touted as a key solution that would allow for a precision approach, thus preventing economies from having to shut down again. However, it is now clear that many regions of the U.S. were unable to mount robust enough testing-tracing programs to prevent major resurgences of disease. This viewpoint offers a discussion of why testing-tracing efforts failed to sufficiently mitigate COVID-19 across much of the nation, with the hope that such deliberation will help the U.S. public health community better plan for the future.","authors":["Eva Clark","Elizabeth Chiao","E Susan Amirian"],"meta":["August 2020Clinical Infectious Diseases 72(9)","DOI:10.1093/cid/ciaa1155"],"references":["341736586_A_National_Plan_to_Enable_Comprehensive_COVID-19_Case_Finding_and_Contact_Tracing_in_the_US","341146059_Ethics_of_instantaneous_contact_tracing_using_mobile_phone_apps_in_the_control_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic","341092863_Contact_Tracing_Assessment_of_COVID-19_Transmission_Dynamics_in_Taiwan_and_Risk_at_Different_Exposure_Periods_Before_and_After_Symptom_Onset","341092133_Early_Detection_of_Covid-19_through_a_Citywide_Pandemic_Surveillance_Platform","341014031_COVID-19-We_urgently_need_to_start_developing_an_exit_strategy","340316786_Quantifying_SARS-CoV-2_transmission_suggests_epidemic_control_with_digital_contact_tracing","344787144_Most_Americans_are_not_willing_or_able_to_use_an_app_tracking_coronavirus_infections_That's_a_problem_for_Big_Tech's_plan_to_slow_the_pandemic","341401508_Reviving_the_US_CDC","341367221_Covid-19_The_US_state_copying_a_global_health_template_for_contact_tracing_success","341094701_Contact_Tracing_Testing_and_Control_of_COVID-19-Learning_from_Taiwan","340568015_Thousands_of_coronavirus_tests_are_going_unused_in_US_labs","340422629_Rapid_sentinel_surveillance_for_COVID-19_-_Santa_Clara_County_California_March_2020","330832907_Should_Immigration_Status_Information_Be_Included_in_a_Patient's_Health_Record","318508478_Monitoring_of_Persons_with_Risk_for_Exposure_to_Ebola_Virus_-_United_States_November_3_2014-December_27_2015"]}
