{"id":"263663231_Global_Convergence_of_Splitting_Methods_for_Nonconvex_Composite_Optimization","abstract":"We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth function $h$ with a\nbounded Hessian, and a nonsmooth function. We assume that the latter function\nis a composition of a proper closed function $P$ and a surjective linear map\n$\\mathcal{M}$, with the proximal mappings of $\\tau P$, $\\tau > 0$, simple to\ncompute. This problem is nonconvex in general and encompasses many important\napplications in engineering and machine learning. In this paper, we examined\ntwo types of splitting methods for solving this nonconvex optimization problem:\nalternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient algorithm.\nFor the direct adaptation of the alternating direction method of multipliers,\nwe show that, if the penalty parameter is chosen sufficiently large and the\nsequence generated has a cluster point, then it gives a stationary point of the\nnonconvex problem. We also establish convergence of the whole sequence under an\nadditional assumption that the functions $h$ and $P$ are semi-algebraic.\nFurthermore, when $\\mathcal{M}$ is the identity so that the proximal gradient\nalgorithm can be efficiently applied, we show that any cluster point is\nstationary under a slightly more flexible constant step-size rule than what is\nknown in the literature for a nonconvex $h$.","authors":["G.
