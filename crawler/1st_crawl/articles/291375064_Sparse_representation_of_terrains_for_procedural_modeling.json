{"id":"291375064_Sparse_representation_of_terrains_for_procedural_modeling","abstract":"In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method to represent terrains as elevation functions built from linear combinationsof landform features (atoms). These features can be extracted either from real world data-sets or procedural primitives, orfrom any combination of multiple terrain models. Our approach consists in representing the elevation function as a sparsecombination of primitives, a concept which we call Sparse Construction Tree, which blends the different landform featuresstored in a dictionary. The sparse representation allows us to represent complex terrains using combinations of atoms from asmall dictionary, yielding a powerful and compact terrain representation and synthesis tool. Moreover, we present a methodfor automatically learning the dictionary and generating the Sparse Construction Tree model. We demonstrate the efficiency ofour method in several applications: inverse procedural modeling of terrains, terrain amplification and synthesis from a coarsesketch.","authors":["Eric Gu√©rin","Julie Digne","Eric Galin","Adrien Peytavie"],"meta":["May 2016Computer Graphics Forum 35(2)","DOI:10.1111/cgf.12821","Project: Sparse representation of terrains for procedural modeling"],"references":["281688303_Local_Barycentric_Coordinates","277720606_First_Person_Sketch-based_Terrain_Editing","275898692_Terrain_Modeling_from_Feature_Primitives","270280282_Robust_Surface_Reconstruction_via_Dictionary_Learning","262772475_Self-similarity_for_accurate_compression_of_point_sampled_surfaces","248703095_Terrain_Generation_Using_Procedural_Models_Based_on_Hydrology","292192025_Large_Scale_Terrain_Generation_from_Tectonic_Uplift_and_Fluvial_Erosion","280972109_Parallel_Realistic_and_Controllable_Terrain_Synthesis","262280412_Interactive_Terrain_Modeling_Using_Hydraulic_Erosion","239475398_Computer_Generation_of_Eroded_Valley_and_Mountain_Ter-rains","235609680_Enhanced_Texture-Based_Terrain_Synthesis_on_Graphics_Hardware","234797883_The_Synthesis_and_Rendering_of_Eroded_Fractal_Terrains","233658435_An_Erosion_Model_Based_on_Velocity_Fields_for_the_Visual_Simulation_of_Mountain_Scenery","230363605_River_Networks_for_Instant_Procedural_Planets","227785630_Hydraulic_erosion"]}
