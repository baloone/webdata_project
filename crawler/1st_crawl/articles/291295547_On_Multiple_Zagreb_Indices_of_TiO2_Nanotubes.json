{"id":"291295547_On_Multiple_Zagreb_Indices_of_TiO2_Nanotubes","abstract":"The First and Second Zagreb indices were first introduced by I. Gutman and N. Trinajstic in 1972. It is reported that these indices are useful in the study of anti-inflammatory activities of certain chemical instances, and in elsewhere. Recently, the first and second multiple Zagreb indices of a graph were introduced by Ghorbani and Azimi in 2012.\n\nIn this paper, we calculate the Zagreb indices and the multiplicative versions of the Zagreb indices of an infinite class of Titania nanotubes TiO2[m,n].","authors":["Mehar Ali Malik","Muhammad Imran"],"meta":["December 2015Acta Chimica Slovenica 2015(62):973-976","DOI:10.17344/acsi.2015.1746"],"references":["276059309_Zagreb_indices_and_their_polynomials_of_the_linear_parallelogram_of_benzenoid_graph_114","269873646_On_Multiple_Zagreb_indices_of_Circumcoronene_Homologous_Series_of_Benzenoid_103","256984527_Some_connectivity_indices_and_zagreb_index_of_polyhex_nanotubes_11","238139975_Topological_Index_A_Newly_Proposed_Quantity_Characterizing_the_Topological_Nature_of_Structural_Isomers_of_Saturated_Hydrocarbons","226247386_Symmetry_and_models_of_single-walled_TiO2_nanotubes_with_rectangular_morphology","246775503_Mathatical_Concepts_in_Organic_Chemistry","244426378_Exploring_QSAR_Fundamentals_and_Applications_in_Chemistry_and_Biology","225192304_Wiener_Index_of_Trees_Theory_and_Applications","222254320_Graph_Theory_and_Molecular_Orbitals_Total_-Electron_Energy_of_Alternant_Hydrocarbons","42309069_Structural_Determination_of_Paraffin_Boiling_Points"]}
