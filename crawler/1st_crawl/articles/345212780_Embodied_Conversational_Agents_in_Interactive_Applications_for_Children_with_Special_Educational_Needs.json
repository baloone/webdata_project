{"id":"345212780_Embodied_Conversational_Agents_in_Interactive_Applications_for_Children_with_Special_Educational_Needs","abstract":"This chapter describes a collection of experiences and recommendations related with the design and evaluation of interactive applications integrating Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) technology in real environments of use with children in Special Education. Benefits and challenges of using ECAs in this context are presented. These benefits and challenges have guided the creation of Special Education reinforcement applications incorporating ECAs, which have been used for extended periods of time at Infanta Elena Special Education School in Madrid. Co-design principles were applied in the development of two of the applications discussed here, with the participation of the school’s teaching staff and children with severe motor and mental disabilities (mainly with cerebral palsy). From the design experience a set of recommendations and observations were extracted, which the authors hope may serve as guidance for the scientific and educational communities when undertaking further research. For example, in an application to reinforce the learning of emotions it believe it beneficial to include ECAs that display a number of exaggerated facial expressions together with a combination of auditory and gestural reinforcements. The ECA should show its eyes and mouth clearly, in order to help the children focus their attention. These and other ECA strategies have been analysed to provide reinforcement in learning and also to attract the children’s attention when interacting with the application.","authors":["Information Resources Management Association","Beatriz López Mencía","David Díaz Pardo de Vera","Álvaro Hernández Trapote"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.4018/978-1-4666-4422-9.ch041","In book: Assistive Technologies (pp.811-840)"],"references":["283629634_Flexi_e-learning_system_Disabled_friendly_education_system","250791471_Development_and_Evaluation_of_emotional_Interface_Agents_in_Training_of_learning_disabled_Children","237439677_The_Case_for_Social_Agency_in_Computer-Based_Teaching_Do_Students_Learn_More_Deeply_When_They_Interact_With_Animated_Pedagogical_Agents","235700862_Co-creation_and_the_New_Landscapes_of_Design","229033422_Learning_with_Virtual_Agents_Competition_and_Cooperation_in_AMICO","222431475_Embodied_conversational_agents_in_Computer_Assisted_Language_Learning","221238472_Co-designing_with_children_A_comparison_of_embodied_and_disembodied_sketching_techniques_in_the_design_of_child_age_communication_devices","221238465_Paper-based_multimedia_interaction_as_learning_tool_for_disabled_children","221238431_Designing_technologies_with_children_with_special_needs_Children_in_the_Centre_CiC_framework","221238379_Investigating_the_impact_of_design_processes_on_children","221238309_How_do_you_play_with_a_robotic_toy_animal_A_long-term_study_of_Pleo","221096330_Can_Virtual_Humans_Be_More_Engaging_Than_Real_Ones","221010257_Embodied_Agents_in_Language_Learning_for_Children_with_Language_Challenges","200772440_Animated_Pedagogical_Agents_Face-to-Face_Interaction_in_Interactive_Learning_Environments","44304757_El_desarrollo_de_las_habilidades_de_comunicacion_asistida_y_de_alfabetizacion_emergente_en_el_contexto_de_la_lectura_interactiva_de_cuentos","38062249_Can_emotion_recognition_be_taught_to_children_with_autism_spectrum_conditions","28576174_Design_of_a_Virtual_Learning_Environment_for_Students_with_Special_Needs","2903788_Developing_and_Evaluating_Conversational_Agents","289455245_Peer_tutoring_and_social_behaviors_A_review","242430302_In_press_AI_Magazine_Embodied_Conversational_Agents_Representation_and_Intelligence_in_User_Interface","228556807_Optimizing_learning_from_examples_using_animated_pedagogical_agents","222825996_Spoken_Spanish_generation_from_sign_language","221607975_Animating_an_interactive_conversational_character_for_an_educational_game_system","221519393_Designing_with_children_with_severe_motor_impairments","221518870_The_Persona_Effect_Affective_Impact_of_Animated_Pedagogical_Agents","221238338_Considering_context_content_management_and_engagement_in_design_activities_with_children","221238305_A_collaborative_approach_to_the_design_and_evaluation_of_an_interactive_learning_tool_for_children_with_special_educational_needs","220934162_Playing_with_virtual_peers_Bootstrapping_contingent_discourse_in_children_with_autism","220120971_An_overview_of_spoken_language_technology_for_education","38062250_Future_affective_technology_for_autism_and_emotion_communication"]}
