{"id":"300209770_Free_Open_Source_Mesh_Healing_for_TCAD_Device_Simulations","abstract":"Device geometries in technology computer-aided design processes are often generated using parametric solid modeling computer-aided design tools. However, geometries generated with these tools often lack geometric properties, like being intersection-free, which are required for volumetric mesh generation as well as discretization methods. Contributing to this problem is the fact, that device geometries often have multiple regions, used for, e.g., assigning different material parameters. Therefore, a healing process of the geometry is required, which detects the errors and repairs them. In this paper, we identify errors in multi-region device geometries created using computer-aided design tools. A robust algorithm pipeline for healing these errors is presented, which has been implemented in ViennaMesh. This algorithm pipeline is applied on complex device geometries. We show, that our approach robustly heals device geometries created with computer-aided design tools and is even able to handle certain modeling inaccuracies.","authors":["Florian Rudolf","Josef Weinbub","Karl Rupp","Peter Resutik"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-26520-9_32","Conference: International Conference on Large-Scale Scientific Computing"],"references":["263212613_Analysis_of_STL_files","220517554_Introduction_to_ISO_10303_-_the_STEP_Standard_for_Product_Data_Exchange_pp","327386560_Delaunay_mesh_generation","264912393_Delaunay_Mesh_Generation","262175346_Polygon_Mesh_Repairing_An_Application_Perspective","260708483_Impact_of_Transistor_Architecture_Bulk_Planar_Trigate_on_Bulk_Ultrathin-Body_Planar_SOI_and_Material_Silicon_or_III-V_Semiconductor_on_Variation_for_Logic_and_SRAM_Applications","245053747_Automatic_mesh-healing_technique_for_model_repair_and_finite_element_model_generation","242922450_Finite_Difference_Schemes_and_Partial_Difference_Equations","240736742_A_Quality_Tetrahedral_Mesh_Generator_and_Three-Dimensional_Delaunay_Triangulator","240665266_TetGen_--_A_Quality_Tetrahedral_Mesh_Generator_and_Three-Dimensional_Delaunay_Triangulator","229710942_Two-dimensional_automatic_mesh_generation_for_structural_analysis","229569730_Mutliple_material_Marching_Cubes_algorithm","220721307_View-dependent_refinement_of_progressive_meshes","4357950_Design_of_a_32nm_Independently-Double-Gated_FlexFET_SOI_Transistor"]}
