{"id":"283801421_Operating_an_unknown_drawer_using_an_aerial_manipulator","abstract":"This paper is about opening and closing an unknown drawer using an aerial manipulator. To accommodate practical applications, it is assumed that the direction of motion and mechanical properties of the drawer are not given beforehand. A multirotor combined with a robotic arm is used for the manipulation task. Typical drawers are allowed to move in only one direction, which constrains the motion of the aerial manipulator while operating a drawer. To analyze this interaction, the dynamic characteristics of the aerial manipulator are modeled. Also, configuration of the aerial manipulator for exerting the desired force to a drawer is presented. To handle the uncertainties associated with the mechanism of a drawer, strategies exploiting velocity of the end effector are employed. The proposed approach is validated with experiments including opening and closing a common drawer, which is detected by a camera mounted in the palm of the end effector.","authors":["Suseong Kim","Hoseong Seo","H.
