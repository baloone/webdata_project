{"id":"333755064_Mobility-Aware_Device-to-Device_Communications_Principles_Practice_and_Challenges","abstract":"Device-to-device (D2D) communication proposes a\nnew epitome in mobile networking to avail data exchange\nbetween physically proximate devices. The exploitation of D2D\ncommunication enables mobile operators to harvest short range\ncommunications for improving network performance and corroborating\nproximity-based services. In this article, we investigate\nmobility aspects of D2D communication, which are indispensable\nfor the adoption and implementation of D2D communication\ntechnology. We present an extensive review of the state-of-theart\nproblems and the corresponding solutions for encouraging the\nexploitation of mobility to assist D2D communication. Specifically,\nby identifying the mobility models, traces, problems, requirements,\nand features of different proposals, we discuss the lessons\nlearned and summarize the advantages of mobility-aware D2D\ncommunication. We also present open problems and highlight\nfuture research directions concerning D2D communication applications\nin real-life scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first comprehensive survey to address mobility-aware D2D\ncommunication, which offers insight to the underlying problems\nand provides the potential solutions.","authors":["Muhammad Waqas","Yong Niu","Yong Li","Manzoor Ahmed"],"meta":["June 2019IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials 22(3):1863 - 1886","DOI:10.1109/COMST.2019.2923708"],"references":["327129165_Incentive_Mechanism_Design_for_Computation_Offloading_in_Heterogeneous_Fog_Computing_A_Contract-Based_Approach","324470987_Social_Security_Aided_D2D_Communications_Performance_Bound_and_Implementation_Mechanism","324266574_A_Survey_on_Socially-Aware_Device-to-Device_Communications","324253557_Socially-Aware_Secrecy-Ensured_Resource_Allocation_in_D2D_Underlay_Communication_An_Overlapping_Coalitional_Game_Scheme","324247662_Social-Aware_Secret_Key_Generation_for_Secure_Device-to-Device_Communication_via_Trusted_and_Non-Trusted_Relays","323333557_A_Survey_of_Opportunistic_Offloading","322947997_Mobility_Assisted_Content_Transmission_For_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","318716529_Vehicle-to-Everything_v2x_Services_Supported_by_LTE-Based_Systems_and_5G","317426725_Mobility-Assisted_Device_to_Device_Communications_For_Content_Transmission","317158647_Leveraging_MANET_based_Cooperative_Cache_Discovery_Techniques_in_VANETs_A_Survey_andAnalysis"]}
