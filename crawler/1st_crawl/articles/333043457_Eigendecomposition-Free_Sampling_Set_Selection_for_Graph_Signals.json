{"id":"333043457_Eigendecomposition-Free_Sampling_Set_Selection_for_Graph_Signals","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of selecting an optimal sampling set for signals on graphs. The proposed sampling set selection (SSS) is based on a localization operator that can consider both vertex domain and spectral domain localizations. We clarify the relationships among the proposed method, sensor position selection methods in machine learning, and existing SSS methods based on graph frequency. In contrast to the alternative graph signal processing-based approaches, the proposed method does not need to compute the eigendecomposition of a variation operator, while still considering (graph) frequency information. We evaluate the performance of our approach through comparisons of prediction errors and execution time.","authors":["Akie Sakiyama","Yuichi Tanaka","Toshihisa Tanaka","Antonio Ortega"],"meta":["May 2019IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 67(10):2679-2692","DOI:10.1109/TSP.2019.2908129"],"references":["323622973_A_Graph_Signal_Processing_Perspective_on_Functional_Brain_Imaging","298338189_Global_and_Local_Uncertainty_Principles_for_Signals_on_Graphs","282402877_Efficient_Sampling_Set_Selection_for_Bandlimited_Graph_Signals_Using_Graph_Spectral_Proxies","280630702_Signals_on_Graphs_Uncertainty_Principle_and_Sampling","274012268_A_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_Sampling_Theory_of_Graph_Signals","273788318_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Sampling_Theory","268226938_Sampling_Large_Data_on_Graphs","262452360_Active_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Using_Sampling_Theory_for_Graph_Signals","261450927_Approximate_solutions_and_performance_bounds_for_the_sensor_placement_problem","261344786_Signal_processing_techniques_for_interpolation_in_graph_structured_data","258794052_Tight_Wavelet_Frames_on_Multislice_Graphs","232743728_The_Emerging_Field_of_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Extending_High-Dimensional_Data_Analysis_to_Networks_and_Other_Irregular_Domains","232272943_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs","221603841_Near-optimal_Observation_Selection_using_Submodular_Functions","220320007_Near-Optimal_Sensor_Placements_in_Gaussian_Processes_Theory_Efficient_Algorithms_and_Empirical_Studies","45875126_Transform-Based_Distributed_Data_Gathering","44451021_SFO_A_Toolbox_for_Submodular_Function_Optimization","327805183_A_Distance-Based_Formulation_for_Sampling_Signals_on_Graphs","324873136_Graph_Signal_Processing_Overview_Challenges_and_Applications","324407775_Statistics_for_Spatial_Data","317726496_Accelerated_sensor_position_selection_using_graph_localization_operator","317660570_Spectral_Domain_Sampling_of_Graph_Signals","309066112_Multilinear_Discriminant_Analysis_With_Subspace_Constraints_for_Single-Trial_Classification_of_Event-Related_Potentials","304372606_Efficient_sensor_position_selection_using_graph_signal_sampling_theory","284096844_Random_Sampling_of_Bandlimited_Signals_on_Graphs","275280004_Sampling_of_Graph_Signals_With_Successive_Local_Aggregations","271472396_Towards_a_sampling_theorem_for_signals_on_arbitrary_graphs","267467707_A_Unifying_Probabilistic_Perspective_for_Spectral_Dimensionality_Reduction_Insights_and_New_Models","264828551_Big_Data_Analysis_with_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Representation_and_processing_of_massive_data_sets_with_irregular_structure","233373487_Maximum_Entropy_Sampling","222404885_Wavelets_on_Graphs_via_Spectral_Graph_Theory","222230014_A_singular_value_inequality_for_block_matrices","4021114_Graph_wavelets_for_spatial_traffic_analysis","2945877_Graph_Wavelets_for_Spatial_Traffic_Analysis","2944181_Model-Driven_Data_Acquisition_in_Sensor_Networks"]}
