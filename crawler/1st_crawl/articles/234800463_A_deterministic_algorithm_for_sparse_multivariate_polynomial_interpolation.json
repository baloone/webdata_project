{"id":"234800463_A_deterministic_algorithm_for_sparse_multivariate_polynomial_interpolation","abstract":"An efficient deterministic polynomial time algorithm is developed for the sparse polynomial interpolation problem. The number of evaluations needed by this algorithm is very small. The algorithm also has a simple NC implementation.","authors":["Michael Ben-Or"],"meta":["January 1988","DOI:10.1145/62212.62241"],"references":["221591460_Finding_Irreducible_Polynomials_over_Finite_Fields","221150072_On_determinants_matchings_and_random_algorithms","298812011_Multivariate_polynomial_interpolation_-_Preface","265587304_Theory_and_Practice_of_Error_Control_Codes","264378252_Factoring_Polynomials_Over_Large_Finite_Fields","247102876_Parallel_algorithms_for_instance_of_the_linear_matroid_parity_with_a_small_number_of_solutions","242399440_System_of_distinct_representatives_and_linear_algebra","239578469_Factoring_polynomials_over_large_finite_fields","234812500_Fast_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Verification_of_Polynomial_Identities","222458971_Interpolating_polynomials_from_their_values"]}
