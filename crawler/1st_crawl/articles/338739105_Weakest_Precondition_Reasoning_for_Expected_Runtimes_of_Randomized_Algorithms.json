{"id":"338739105_Weakest_Precondition_Reasoning_for_Expected_Runtimes_of_Randomized_Algorithms","abstract":"This article presents a wp--style calculus for obtaining bounds on the expected runtime of randomized algorithms. Its application includes determining the (possibly infinite) expected termination time of a randomized algorithm and proving positive almost--sure termination—does a program terminate with probability one in finite expected time? We provide several proof rules for bounding the runtime of loops, and prove the soundness of the approach with respect to a simple operational model. We show that our approach is a conservative extension of Nielson’s approach for reasoning about the runtime of deterministic programs. We analyze the expected runtime of some example programs including the coupon collector’s problem, a one--dimensional random walk and a randomized binary search.","authors":["Benjamin Lucien Kaminski","Joost-Pieter Katoen","Christoph Matheja","F Olmedo"],"meta":["August 2018","Project: Quantitative Weakest Precondition Reasoning"],"references":["329408333_Bounded_Expectations_Resource_Analysis_for_Probabilistic_Programs","323471077_How_long_O_Bayesian_network_will_I_sample_thee_A_program_analysis_perspective_on_expected_sampling_times","309172205_Reasoning_about_Recursive_Probabilistic_Programs","277895561_On_the_Hardness_of_Almost-Sure_Termination","267652048_Proof_rules_for_recursive_procedures","316617903_Automated_Recurrence_Analysis_for_Almost-Linear_Expected-Runtime_Bounds","313550915_An_Axiomatic_Basis_of_Computer_Programming","305906598_Formalising_Semantics_for_Expected_Running_Time_of_Probabilistic_Programs","282925483_Probabilistic_termination_Soundness_completeness_and_compositionality","268433585_Amortized_Resource_Analysis"]}
