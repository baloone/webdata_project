{"id":"317904765_Real-time_Environmental_Applications_and_Display_sYstem_READY","abstract":"Air quality forecasters, emergency responders, aviation interests, government agencies, and the atmospheric research community are among those who require access to tools to analyze and predict the transport and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. Because of this need, the unique web-based Real-time Environmental Applications and Display sYstem (READY) has been under continuous development since 1997 to provide access to a suite of tools for producing air parcel trajectory and dispersion model results and displaying meteorological data.","authors":["Glenn Rolph","Ariel Stein","Barbara J.
