{"id":"308968450_Possible_Worlds_x_Psychiatry","abstract":"We here try to apply the concept of Possible/Parallel Worlds from Logic, which came to our knowledge through the hands of Graham Priest, and through a French movie, to Psychiatry. We think this concept is ideal because we can make use of mathematical elements to draw theories of control, and diagnosis, and therefore also therapeutic theories. We will make use of the new model of psyche proposed by us to expand on a few items. Perhaps the best use of this paper is empowering the professionals of Psychiatry, and Psychology by providing new tools for their studies, and work. The main focus is the human psyche. In order to explain the World of God, Inner Reality, and Outer Reality, which are divisions that are obtained from applying the concept of parallel worlds to the studies on the human psyche, we end up paying a light, and perhaps, an enlightening, visit to the concepts of schizophrenia, autism, Down Syndrome, and psychopathy.","authors":["Marcia Ricci Pinheiro"],"meta":["October 2016","Project: Human Psyche"],"references":["286161870_A_New_Model_for_the_Human_Psyche"]}
