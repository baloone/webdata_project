{"id":"13227501_Error_Correcting_Codes_in_Quantum_Theory","abstract":"A new type of uncertainty relation is presented, concerning the information-bearing properties of a discrete quantum system. A natural link is then revealed between basic quantum theory and the linear error correcting codes of classical information theory. A subset of the known codes is described, having properties which are important for error correction in quantum communication. It is shown that a pair of states which are, in a certain sense, “macroscopically different,” can form a superposition in which the interference phase between the two parts is measurable. This provides a highly stabilized “Schrödinger cat” state.","authors":["Andrew Steane"],"meta":["August 1996Physical Review Letters 77(5):793-797","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.793","SourcePubMed"],"references":["38328397_Uncertainty_relations_for_information_entropy_in_wave_mechanics","13251850_Generalized_Entropic_Uncertainty_Relations","2201189_Quantum_Cryptography","260416644_Error_Detecting_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","243470584_Uncertainty_in_Quantum_Measurements","243403070_Quantum_cryptography_How_to_beat_the_code_breakers_using_quantum_mechanics","237243628_Quantum_Theory_the_Church-Turing_Principle_and_the_Universal_Quantum_Computer","13375764_Shor_P_W_Scheme_for_reducing_decoherence_in_quantum_computer_memory_Phys_Rev_A_52_R2493-R2496","13248366_Extreme_quantum_entanglement_in_a_superposition_of_macroscopically_distinct_states"]}
