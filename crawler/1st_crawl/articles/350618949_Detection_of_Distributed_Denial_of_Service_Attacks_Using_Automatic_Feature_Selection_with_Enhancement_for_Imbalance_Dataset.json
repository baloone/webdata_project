{"id":"350618949_Detection_of_Distributed_Denial_of_Service_Attacks_Using_Automatic_Feature_Selection_with_Enhancement_for_Imbalance_Dataset","abstract":"With the development of technology, the highly accessible internet service is the biggest demand for most people. Online network, however, has been suffering from malicious attempts to disrupt essential web technologies, resulting in service failures. In this work, we introduced a model to detect and classify Distributed Denial of Service attacks based on neural networks that take advantage of a proposed automatic feature selection component. The experimental results on CIC-DDoS 2019 dataset have demonstrated that our proposed model outperformed other machine learning-based model by large margin. We also investigated the effectiveness of weighted loss and hinge loss on handling the class imbalance problem.","authors":["Duy-Cat Can","Hoang-Quynh Le","Quang Thuy Ha"],"meta":["April 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-73280-6_31","In book: Intelligent Information and Database Systems (pp.386-398)"],"references":["342345202_DDoSNet_A_Deep-Learning_Model_for_Detecting_Network_Attacks","339491440_DDoS_Attack_Detection_via_Multi-scale_Convolutional_Neural_Network","336953914_Developing_Realistic_Distributed_Denial_of_Service_DDoS_Attack_Dataset_and_Taxonomy","332165523_Survey_on_deep_learning_with_class_imbalance","318638796_A_review_of_detection_approaches_for_distributed_denial_of_service_attacks","307947686_An_Intelligent_DDoS_Attack_Detection_System_Using_Packet_Analysis_and_Support_Vector_Machine","304371694_Frequency_Based_DDoS_Attack_Detection_Approach_Using_Naive_Bayes_Classification","301355117_Frequency_Based_DDoS_Attack_Detection_Approach_Using_Naive_Bayes_Classification","283894681_Detection_of_known_and_unknown_DDoS_attacks_using_Artificial_Neural_Networks","220762575_A_prediction-based_detection_algorithm_against_distributed_denial-of-service_attacks","220277492_DDoS_detection_and_traceback_with_decision_tree_and_grey_relational_analysis","215616968_Understanding_the_difficulty_of_training_deep_feedforward_neural_networks","3301305_Collaborative_Detection_of_DDoS_Attacks_over_Multiple_Network_Domains","336595499_Deep_learning_approaches_for_anomaly-based_intrusion_detection_systems_A_survey_taxonomy_and_open_issues","333010705_DDoS_Attacks_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","322866638_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_to_Network_Intrusion_Detection","311609137_Learning_Deep_Representation_for_Imbalanced_Classification","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","238625098_On_the_Algorithmic_Implementation_of_Multiclass_Kernel-based_Vector_Machines","222428883_DDoS_attacks_and_defense_mechanisms_Classification_and_state-of-the-art"]}
