{"id":"3869963_Intelligent_image_correlation_using_genetic_algorithms_for_measuring_surface_deformations_in_the_autonomous_inspection_of_structures","abstract":"Summary form only given. Presents an intelligent digital image\ncorrelation technique that uses genetic algorithms to estimate surface\ndisplacements and strains for autonomous inspection of structures.\nSpeckle patterns are spray painted on the surface of interest and\npictures taken before and during loading using off-the-shelf CCD\nquickcams. Subpixel accuracy, required for measuring displacements and\nstrains accurately, is obtained by using interpolation methods. An\ninnovative adaptive scheme is used to develop a cost surface which is\nused to match the before and after image subsets with the help of\ngenetic algorithms to search for the optimal match. Some potential\napplications for this work are to extract real time information on\nsurface displacements and strains on aircraft in flight, submarines\nunder water and civil infrastructures such as bridges and\nbuildings","authors":["Ajay Mahajan","A.
