{"id":"318913212_Sometimes_Rainfall_Accumulates_Talk-Alouds_with_Novice_Functional_Programmers","abstract":"When functional programming is used in studies of the Rainfall\nproblem in CS1, most students seem to perform fairly well. A handful\nof students, however, still struggle, though with different surface-level\nerrors than those reported for students programming imperatively.\nPrior research suggests that novice programmers tackle\nproblems by refining a high-level program schema that they have\nseen for a similar problem. Functional-programming students, however,\nhave often seen multiple schemas that would apply to Rainfall.\nHow do novices navigate these choices? This paper presents results\nfrom a talk-aloud study in which novice functional programmers\nworked on Rainfall. We describe the criteria that drove students\nto select, and sometimes switch, their high-level program schema,\nas well as points where students realized that their chosen schema\nwas not working. Our main contribution lies in our observations of\nhow novice programmers approach a multi-task planning problem\nin the face of multiple viable schemas.","authors":["Francisco Enrique Vicente Castro","Kathi Fisler"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1145/3105726.3106183","Conference: International Computing Education Research 2017At: Tacoma, WA, USA"],"references":["293489068_On_the_Interplay_Between_Bottom-Up_and_Datatype-Driven_Program_Design","288002756_Do_we_know_how_difficult_the_Rainfall_Problem_is","265786971_A_qualitative_think-aloud_study_of_novice_programmers'_code_writing_strategies","234796737_Learning_to_Program_Learning_to_Construct_Mechanisms_and_Explanations","234095876_Learning_to_Program_Recursive_Functions","220812001_Simulating_Student_Programmers","307091041_Aspects_of_Graduateness_in_Computing_Students'_Narratives","307087823_Break_statement_considered","266661046_The_recurring_rainfall_problem","261341097_Soloway's_Rainfall_Problem_Has_Become_Harder","254218264_Phenomenography_and_grounded_theory_as_research_methods_in_computing_education_research_field","242423697_How_to_design_programs","238683750_The_Roe_of_Learning_from_Examples_in_the_Acquisition_of_Recursive_Programming_Skills","238673969_Knowledge_Creation_and_Retrieval_in_Program_Design_A_Comparison_of_Novice_and_Intermediate_Student_Programmers","234826946_Teaching_and_assessing_programming_strategies_explicitly","232597223_The_Subgoal_Learning_Model_Creating_Better_Examples_so_That_Students_Can_Solve_Novel_Problems","222465728_Schema_Creation_in_Programming","221209606_A_closer_look_at_tracing_explaining_and_code_writing_skills_in_the_novice_programmer","220808064_Pattern-oriented_instruction_and_its_influence_on_problem_decomposition_and_solution_construction","200086130_Novice_programmer_errors_language_constructs_and_plan_composition"]}
