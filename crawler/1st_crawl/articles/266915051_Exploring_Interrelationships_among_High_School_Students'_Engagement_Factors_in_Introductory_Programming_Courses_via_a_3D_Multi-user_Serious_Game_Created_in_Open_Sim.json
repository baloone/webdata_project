However, less attention was given to their positive or negative impact on student engagement. The current study seeks to investigate the interrelationships of students’ engagement among multidimensional construct consisting of cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors in order to understand better the educational community the learning effectiveness emerged through a 3D computer-supported and multi-user serious game created for introductory programming courses. An instructional design framework based on Papert’s theory of Constructionism to be amplified the students’ activities and management of their interactions in a 3D multi-user serious game created via an Open Sim standalone server integrated with Scratch4OS is also proposed. Fifty-five (n=55) voluntary students of three different high schools participated and experienced in a 3D mind-trap puzzle game named Co.Co.I.A. (Collaborative Construction of Interactive Artifacts). The empirical study findings indicated that student behavioral engagement (attention, retention and energy expenditure for activity completion) had not only a linear correlation with cognitive engagement (learning strategies for the construction of the knowledge domain), but it had also a positive association with emotional engagement (positive emotions and achievement orientation) in collaborative learning tasks, causing the reinforcement of the other two factors as well.","authors":["Nikolaos Pellas"],"meta":["November 2014JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE 20(12):1608-1628","Project: Virtual Worlds in STEM education"],"references":["271271501_Multi-User_Virtual_Environments_and_Serious_Games_for_Team_Building_in_Organizations","261758612_Utilizing_a_Serious_Game_via_Open_Sim_Standalone_Server_and_Scratch4OS_for_Introductory_Programming_Courses_in_Secondary_Education_Their_Effect_on_Student_Engagement","281198756_Utilizing_virtual_worlds_in_education_The_implications_for_practice","264210453_Investigating_the_role_of_computer-supported_annotation_in_problem-solving-based_teaching_An_empirical_study_of_a_Scratch_programming_pedagogy","263040868_Designing_collaborative_multiplayer_serious_games_Escape_from_Wilson_Island-A_multiplayer_3D_serious_game_for_collaborative_learning_in_teams","262414926_Toward_a_3D_Hand_Gesture_Multi-threaded_Programming_Environment","262351935_Utilizing_Multiplayer_Video_Game_Design_Principles_to_Enhance_the_Educational_Experience_in_3D_Virtual_Computer_Supported_Collaborative_Learning_Environments","262204306_Assessment_frequency_in_introductory_computer_programming_disciplines","261494831_Utilizing_Virtual_Worlds_for_Game_Based_Learning_Grafica_a_3D_Educational_Game_in_Second_Life","261161988_Multiplayer_3D_Game_in_Supporting_Team-Building_Activities_in_a_Work_Organization"]}
