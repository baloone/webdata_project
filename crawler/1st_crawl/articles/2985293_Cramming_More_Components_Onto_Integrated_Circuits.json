{"id":"2985293_Cramming_More_Components_Onto_Integrated_Circuits","abstract":"The future of integrated electronics is the future of electronics itself. Integrated circuits will lead to such wonders as home computers, automatic controls for automobiles, and personal portable communications equipment. But the biggest potential lies in the production of large systems. In telephone communications, integrated circuits in digital filters will separate channels on multiplex equipment. Integrated circuits will also switch telephone circuits and perform data processing. In addition, the improved reliability made possible by integrated circuits will allow the construction of larger processing units. Machines similar to those in existence today will be built at lower costs and with faster turnaround.","authors":["G.E.
