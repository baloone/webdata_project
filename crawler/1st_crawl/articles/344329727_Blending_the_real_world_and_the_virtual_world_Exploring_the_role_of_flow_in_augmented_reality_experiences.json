{"id":"344329727_Blending_the_real_world_and_the_virtual_world_Exploring_the_role_of_flow_in_augmented_reality_experiences","abstract":"This study examines the ‘sweet spot’ of augmented reality (AR) through the lens of flow theory and has two primary objectives. First, the study seeks to determine whether investment in AR technologies is warranted by exploring flow in both an AR and a traditional shopping context. Second, the study examines the unique cap-abilities of AR to facilitate an enhanced state of flow and its positive influence across several consumer outcomes.To achieve these objectives, a commercially available AR app was utilized to conduct an online, between-sub-jects experiment with 500 participants. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the predictor variables of consumer flow, as well as the impact of flow across several consumer outcomes.Managerial and practical conclusions for marketers and designers are provided to support the creation and execution of AR technology within consumer contexts.","authors":["Jennifer Barhorst","Esta Shah"],"meta":["September
