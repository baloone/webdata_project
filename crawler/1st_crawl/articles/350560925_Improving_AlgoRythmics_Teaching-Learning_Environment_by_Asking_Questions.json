{"id":"350560925_Improving_AlgoRythmics_Teaching-Learning_Environment_by_Asking_Questions","abstract":"In this paper the challenge of promoting computational thinking for all by\ncontextualized computing education is addressed. The two phases learning session\nwe designed was implemented in the AlgoRythmics environment which includes\nten algorithmic dance choreographies (and attached interactive computer\nanimations). In addition to previous studies that had focused only on supporting\nstudents in assimilating the strategy of the studied algorithms, this study examined\nwhether they are able to build on this knowledge by extracting from visualizations\nsome algorithm efficiency related concepts too. To this end, the learning\nenvironment was complemented/supplemented with targeted questioning (with and\nwithout teacher guidance). Participants (first year undergraduate students) were\ngrouped based on the number of years they had learned programming in high\nschool (0, 1/2 or 4 years). We performed two analyses: (1) group-0 vs. group-1/2\nand group-4 (N=181; self-paced setting: algorithm visualization complemented\nwith teacher prepared questions); (2) group-0 (one-group pretest-posttest design,\nN=46; supplementary Socratic questioning). Research results revealed that the\nAlgoRythmics environment, if complemented/supplemented with tutorial questionasking, could be an effective instrument in introducing students with no prior\nknowledge in computing (group-0), even with deeper Computer Science concepts\nsuch as algorithm efficiency.","authors":["Zoltan Katai","Oszti√°n Erika"],"meta":["April 2021International Journal of Instruction 14(2):27-44","DOI:10.29333/iji.2021.1423a"],"references":["340423410_Promoting_computational_thinking_of_both_sciences-_and_humanities-oriented_students_an_instructional_and_motivational_design_perspective","338745202_Role_of_questions_in_inquiry-based_instruction_towards_a_design_taxonomy_for_question-asking_and_implications_for_design","319959476_Demystifying_computational_thinking","317365858_Students'_and_Teachers'_Experiences_With_the_Implementation_of_Problem-Based_Learning_at_a_University_Law_School","317177785_Using_collaborative_learning_scenarios_to_teach_programming_to_non-CS_majors","320359151_Effectiveness_and_efficiency_of_adding_drawing_prompts_to_an_interactive_educational_technology_when_learning_with_visual_representations","319445739_Learning_symbols_from_permanent_and_transient_visual_presentations_Don't_overplay_the_hand","313737754_Cognitive_Apprenticeship_Making_Thinking_Visible","311489062_Computational_Art_Introducing_High_School_Students_to_Computing_via_Art","305263085_A_Socratic_approach_to_helping_novice_programmers_debug_programs","303729712_Evaluation_of_the_Formal_Models_for_the_Socratic_Method","301581272_Conditions_for_the_Effectiveness_of_Multiple_Visual_Representations_in_Enhancing_STEM_Learning","304375733_Does_animation_enhance_learning_A_meta-analysis","292129521_The_contributions_of_co-occurring_forms_of_classroom_discourse_and_academic_activities_to_curriculum_events_and_instruction","279428857_Evolution_of_human_cognitive_architecture"]}
