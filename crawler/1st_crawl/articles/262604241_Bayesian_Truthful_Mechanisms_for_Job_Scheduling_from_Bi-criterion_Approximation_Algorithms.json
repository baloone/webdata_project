{"id":"262604241_Bayesian_Truthful_Mechanisms_for_Job_Scheduling_from_Bi-criterion_Approximation_Algorithms","abstract":"We provide polynomial-time approximately optimal Bayesian mechanisms for\nmakespan minimization on unrelated machines as well as for max-min fair\nallocations of indivisible goods, with approximation factors of $2$ and\n$\\min\\{m-k+1, \\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k})\\}$ respectively, matching the approximation\nratios of best known polynomial-time \\emph{algorithms} (for max-min fairness,\nthe latter claim is true for certain ratios of the number of goods $m$ to\npeople $k$). Our mechanisms are obtained by establishing a polynomial-time\napproximation-sensitive reduction from the problem of designing approximately\noptimal {\\em mechanisms} for some arbitrary objective ${\\cal O}$ to that of\ndesigning bi-criterion approximation {\\em algorithms} for the same objective\n${\\cal O}$ plus a linear allocation cost term. Our reduction is itself enabled\nby extending the celebrated \"equivalence of separation and\noptimization\"[GLSS81,KP80] to also accommodate bi-criterion approximations.\nMoreover, to apply the reduction to the specific problems of makespan and\nmax-min fairness we develop polynomial-time bi-criterion approximation\nalgorithms for makespan minimization with costs and max-min fairness with\ncosts, adapting the algorithms of [ST93], [BD05] and [AS07] to the type of\nbi-criterion approximation that is required by the reduction.","authors":["Constantinos Daskalakis","S.
