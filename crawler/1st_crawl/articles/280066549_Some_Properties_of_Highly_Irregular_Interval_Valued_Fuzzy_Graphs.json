{"id":"280066549_Some_Properties_of_Highly_Irregular_Interval_Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","abstract":"Theoretical concepts of graphs are highly utilized by computer science applications. Especially\nin research areas of computer science such as data mining, image segmentation, clustering, image capturing and networking. The interval-valued fuzzy graphs are more flexible and compatible than fuzzy graphs due\nto the fact that they allowed the degree of membership of a vertex to an edge to be represented by interval values in [0.1] rather than the crisp values between 0 and 1. In this paper, we discussed some properties of isomorphism, weak isomorphism and co-weak isomorphism between highly irregular interval-valued fuzzy graphs and its complement. Isomorphism properties of μ-complement, self μ-complement and self weak μ- complement of highly irregular interval-valued fuzzy graph are established. Finally, we defined interval valued fuzzy digraphs.","authors":["Hossein Rashmanlou","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["December 2013World Applied Sciences Journal 27(12):1756-1773","Project: Fuzzy Social Networks"],"references":["301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","280087257_Isomorphism_on_Interval_-_valued_fuzzy_graphs","280087104_Some_Operations_on_Vague_Graphs","280067009_Complete_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","266176390_Strong_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Graphs","265951642_K-path_irregular_graphs","264419556_Isomorphism_On_Irregular_Fuzzy_Graphs","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs","264994797_Complement_of_a_fuzzy_graph"]}
