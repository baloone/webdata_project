In this research, a traditional two-dimensional method (paper), a two-dimensional (2D) display touch screen and the three-dimensional (3D) (Augmented Reality (AR)) visual displays based on the computer are constructed for the SWND to do the ToM test questions. In this work, The Little Prince story written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is adapted to the ToM test questions to measure the SWND’s ToM abilities. In this novel approach, three environments: a traditional two-dimensional method (paper), the 2D display touch screen and the AR visual display environments are experienced by the SWND. The experimental results are compared according to SWND’s ToM success ratios, their ToM perspective skills’, their satisfaction on these different test environments. This research suggests the novel approach to measure the ToM abilities of the SWND with human- computer interaction aspect. This article displays the positive effects of the 2D display touch screen and the AR usage on the Tom Test for the SWND.","authors":["N.
