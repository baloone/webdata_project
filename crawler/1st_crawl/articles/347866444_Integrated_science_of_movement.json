{"id":"347866444_Integrated_science_of_movement","abstract":"Recent technological advances in movement data acquisition have enabled researchers in many disciplines to study movement at increasingly detailed spatial and temporal scales. Yet there is little overlap in the sharing of methods and models between disciplines, despite similar research objectives and data models. Attempts to bridge this gap are leading towards the establishment of an overarching interdisciplinary science, termed the Integrated Science of Movement. Here we present opportunities and challenges of this process and outline the crucial role that GIScience as a discipline with a focus on space, place, and time can play in the integrated science of movement.","authors":["Urška Demšar","Jed A.
