{"id":"320095672_Landmark_based_localization_in_urban_environment","abstract":"A landmark based localization with uncertainty analysis based on cameras and geo-referenced landmarks is presented in this paper. The system is developed to adapt different camera configurations for six degree-of-freedom pose estimation. Local bundle adjustment is applied for optimization and the geo-referenced landmarks are integrated to reduce the drift. In particular, the uncertainty analysis is taken into account. On the one hand, we estimate the uncertainties of poses to predict the precision of localization. On the other hand, uncertainty propagation is considered for matching, tracking and landmark registering. The proposed method is evaluated on both KITTI benchmark and the data acquired by a mobile mapping system. In our experiments, decimeter level accuracy can be reached.","authors":["Xiaozhi Qu","Bahman Soheilian","Nicolas Paparoditis"],"meta":["September 2017ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 140","DOI:10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.09.010"],"references":["309731985_Flow-Decoupled_Normalized_Reprojection_Error_for_Visual_Odometry","308864003_Vehicle_localization_using_mono-camera_and_geo-referenced_traffic_signs","307530130_GPS-denied_geo-localisation_using_visual_odometry","319770169_LSD-SLAM_large-scale_direct_monocular_SLAM","314382594_Augmenting_Vehicle_Localization_Accuracy_with_Cameras_and_3D_Road_Infrastructure_Database","313658583_Bundle_adjustment_-_A_modern_synthesis","309317476_ORB-SLAM2_an_Open-Source_SLAM_System_for_Monocular_Stereo_and_RGB-D_Cameras","308855101_Large-scale_direct_SLAM_with_stereo_cameras","308728729_Stereo_odometry_based_on_careful_feature_selection_and_tracking","305997806_Landmark_based_localization_LBA_refinement_using_MCMC-optimized_projections_of_RJMCMC-extracted_road_marks"]}
