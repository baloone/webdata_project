{"id":"338599506_Improving_Parity_Game_Solvers_with_Justifications","abstract":"Parity games are infinite two-player games played on node-weighted directed graphs. Formal verification problems such as verifying and synthesizing automata, bounded model checking of LTL, CTL*, propositional -calculus, ... reduce to problems over parity games. The core problem of parity game solving is deciding the winner of some (or all) nodes in a parity game. In this paper, we improve several parity game solvers by using a justification graph. Experimental evaluation shows our algorithms improve upon the state-of-the-art.","authors":["Ruben Lapauw","Maurice Bruynooghe","Marc Denecker"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-39322-9_21","In book: Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation (pp.449-470)"],"references":["331328824_An_ordered_approach_to_solving_parity_games_in_quasi-polynomial_time_and_quasi-linear_space","324457815_Oink_An_Implementation_and_Evaluation_of_Modern_Parity_Game_Solvers","232642209_Efficient_Instantiation_of_Parameterised_Boolean_Equation_Systems_toParity_Games","225624564_Small_Progress_Measures_for_Solving_Parity_Games","221027060_Solving_Parity_Games_in_Practice","45930637_FOFD_Extending_classical_logic_with_rule-based_fixpoint_definitions","324182139_Attracting_Tangles_to_Solve_Parity_Games","321610844_Automata_Logics_and_Infinite_Games_A_Guide_to_Current_Research","318409748_An_ordered_approach_to_solving_parity_games_in_quasi_polynomial_time_and_quasi_linear_space","317639766_Deciding_parity_games_in_quasipolynomial_time","310504480_Improving_Priority_Promotion_for_Parity_Games","305252940_Solving_Parity_Games_via_Priority_Promotion","265089473_The_Fixpoint-Iteration_Algorithm_for_Parity_Games","263891611_Benchmarks_for_Parity_Games","262390743_An_Overview_of_the_mCRL2_Toolset_and_Its_Recent_Advances","225812196_An_improved_algorithm_for_the_evaluation_of_fixpoint_expressions","222802132_Monadic_second-order_logic_on_tree-like_structures","222502797_Fast_and_simple_nested_fixpoints","222480808_Zielonka_W_Infinite_games_on_finitely_coloured_graphs_with_applications_to_automata_on_infinite_trees_Theor_Comput_Sci_2001-2_135-183","221558319_An_Optimal_Strategy_Improvement_Algorithm_for_Solving_Parity_and_Payoff_Games","221443040_Efficient_Model_Checking_in_Fragments_of_the_Propositional_Mu-Calculus_Extended_Abstract","221403279_An_Improved_Algorithm_for_the_Evaluation_of_Fixpoint_Expressions"]}
