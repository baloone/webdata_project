{"id":"327000157_Discriminating_Between_Empirical_Studies_and_Nonempirical_Works_Using_Automated_Text_Classification","abstract":"Objective\nIdentify the most performant automated text classification method (e.g., algorithm) for differentiating empirical studies from nonempirical works in order to facilitate systematic mixed studies reviews.\n\nMethods\nThe algorithms were trained and validated with 8,050 database records which had previously been manually categorized as empirical or non empirical. A Boolean mixed filter developed for filtering MEDLINE records (title, abstract, keywords, full‐texts) was used as a baseline. The set of features (e.g., characteristics from the data) included observable terms and concepts extracted from a metathesaurus. The efficiency of the approaches was measured using sensitivity, precision, specificity and accuracy.\n\nResults\nThe decision trees algorithm demonstrated the highest performance, surpassing the accuracy of the Boolean mixed filter by 30%. The use of full‐texts did not result in significant gains compared to title, abstract, keywordsrecords. Results also showed that mixing concepts with observable terms can improve the classification.\n\nSignificance\nScreening of records, identified in bibliographic databases, for relevant studies to include in systematic reviews can be accelerated with automated text classification.","authors":["Alexis Langlois","Jian-yun Nie","James Thomas","Quan Nha Hong"],"meta":["August 2018Research Synthesis Methods 9(3)","DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1317"],"references":["303482552_SWIFT-Review_A_text-mining_workbench_for_systematic_review","301684572_Using_Mixed_Methods_Research_Synthesis_for_Literature_Reviews","301347208_Uncovering_the_benefits_of_participatory_research_Implications_of_a_realist_review_for_health_research_and_practice","293637334_A_scoping_review_on_the_conduct_and_reporting_of_scoping_reviews","291949055_Performance_of_a_mixed_filter_to_identify_relevant_studies_for_mixed_studies_reviews","290824736_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Voting_Classification_Algorithms_Bagging_Boosting_and_Variants","284771009_Supporting_systematic_reviews_using_LDA-based_document_representations","281842987_Using_text_mining_for_study_identification_in_systematic_reviews_A_systematic_review_of_current_approaches","267734412_Barriers_to_Implementation_of_Case_Management_for_Patients_With_Dementia_A_Systematic_Mixed_Studies_Review","263354878_Case_management_for_dementia_in_primary_health_care_A_systematic_mixed_studies_review_based_on_the_diffusion_of_innovation_model","258120315_Pinpointing_needles_in_giant_haystacks_Use_of_text_mining_to_reduce_impractical_screening_workload_in_extremely_large_scoping_reviews","257839643_Barriers_and_facilitators_to_implementing_electronic_prescription_A_systematic_review_of_user_groups'_perceptions","224952248_Machine_Learning_in_Automated_Text_Categorization","220343893_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Voting_Classification_Algorithms_Bagging_Boosting_and_Variants","220343419_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","51482172_Assessing_the_Benefits_of_Participatory_Research_A_Rationale_for_a_Realist_Review","50592259_Assessing_the_outcomes_of_participatory_research_Protocol_for_identifying_selecting_appraising_and_synthesizing_the_literature_for_realist_review","45274023_Expediting_systematic_reviews_Methods_and_implications_of_rapid_reviews","28807547_Use_Google_Scholar_Scopus_and_Web_of_Science_for_Comprehensive_Citation_Tracking","338635359_Dementia_in_Canadian_primary_health_care_The_potential_role_of_case_management","313745907_Experiments_with_a_new_boosting_algorithm_machine_learning","308086043_The_Mass_Production_of_Redundant_Misleading_and_Conflicted_Systematic_Reviews_and_Meta-analyses_Mass_Production_of_Systematic_Reviews_and_Meta-analyses","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","303132310_A_study_of_smoothing_methods_for_language_models_applied_to_ad_hoc_information_retrieval","295256158_The_plurality_of_methods_for_reviews_and_syntheses_Opening-up_the_definition_of_systematic_reviews","285729446_Cochrane_Handbook_for_Systematic_Reviews_of_Interventions","284710400_Patient_Information_Aid_Promoting_the_Right_to_Know_Evaluate_and_Share_Consumer_Health_Information_Found_on_the_Internet","275164301_Classification_of_Text_Documents","267043881_Development_of_a_search_filter_for_identifying_studies_completed_in_primary_care","265388625_Systematic_mixed_studies_reviews_updating_results_on_the_reliability_and_efficiency_of_the_Mixed_Methods_Appraisal_Tool","258279886_Combining_the_Power_of_Stories_and_the_Power_of_Numbers_Mixed_Methods_Research_and_Mixed_Studies_Reviews","244498683_Experiment_With_a_New_Boosting_Algorithm","242637644_An_Algorithm_for_Suffix_Stripping","240702466_The_Causal_Devolution","234827916_Support_Vector_Machine_Active_Learning_With_Applications_To_Text_Classification","227992366_Searching_for_Studies","227341118_Uncovering_the_Benefits_of_Participatory_Research_Implications_of_a_Realist_Review_for_Health_Research_and_Practice","226270700_Bagging_Predictors","221605389_Analyses_of_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","220228998_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval","220017645_A_comprehensive_comparative_study_on_term_weighting_schemes_for_text_categorization_with_support_vector_machines","43693111_Scientific_Journal_Publishing_Yearly_Volume_and_Open_Access_Availability","6695692_Developing_Optimal_Search_Strategies_for_Retrieving_Qualitative_Studies_in_PsycINFO","2552792_A_Re-Examination_of_Text_Categorization_Methods","2454668_A_Comparative_Study_on_Feature_Selection_in_Text_Categorization","2430239_Less_is_More_Active_Learning_with_Support_Vector_Machines","2366134_A_Study_of_Smoothing_Methods_for_Language_Models_Applied_to_Ad_Hoc_Information_Retrieval"]}
