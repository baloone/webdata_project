{"id":"242695924_Combining_design-based_research_and_action_research_to_test_management_solutions","abstract":"This paper presents an approach to organizational research that aims to produce research results that are both relevant and rigorous. The research approach combines the designing of a management tool with the testing of the tool using an action research methodology. The lack of relevance in organizational research is a much debated issue in literature. A design approach has been proposed to help bridge the gap between research and practice. However, in organizational research, there is little empirical evidence how design-based research works in practice and it is unclear how this type of research is best structured. The purpose of the paper is to illustrate what a comprehensive methodology for design-based research can look like and how an action research methodology can be used to test the design in practice.","authors":["Daniel Andriessen"],"meta":["January 2006"],"references":["324988883_Across_the_Great_Divide_Knowledge_Creation_and_Transfer_Between_Practitioners_and_Academics","283414441_2002_Presidential_Address_A_Dream_for_the_Academy","258028835_Design-Based_Research_An_Emerging_Paradigm_for_Educational_Inquiry","250183524_Design_Experiments_and_Laboratory_Approaches_to_Learning_Steps_Toward_Collaborative_Exchange","317433838_Handbook_of_Qualitative_Research","313097321_Participatory_action_research","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","289652856_Critical_theory_and_critical_participatory_action_research","277426294_What_if_the_Academy_Actually_Mattered","271429289_Design_Research_Theoretical_and_Methodological_Issues"]}
