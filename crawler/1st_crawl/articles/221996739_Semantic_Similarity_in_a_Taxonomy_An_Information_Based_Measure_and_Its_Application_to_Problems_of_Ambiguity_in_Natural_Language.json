{"id":"221996739_Semantic_Similarity_in_a_Taxonomy_An_Information_Based_Measure_and_Its_Application_to_Problems_of_Ambiguity_in_Natural_Language","abstract":"This article presents a measure of semantic similarity in an IS-A taxonomy based on the notion of shared information content. Experimental evaluation against a benchmark set of human similarity judgments demonstrates that the measure performs better than the traditional edge-counting approach. The article presents algorithms that take advantage of taxonomic similarity in resolving syntactic and semantic ambiguity, along with experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.","authors":["Ps Resnik"],"meta":["July 1999Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 11:95-130","DOI:10.1613/jair.514","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["266452571_Exploration_in_Automatic_Thesaurus_Discovery","232487232_Respects_for_Similarity","221300122_Query_Expansion_Using_Lexical-Semantic_Relations","221299854_Using_WordNet_to_Disambiguate_Word_Senses_for_Text_Retrieval","220481453_Attaching_Multiple_Prepositional_Phrases_Generalized_Backed-off_Estimation","220420019_Contextual_correlates_of_synonymy","220418919_Combining_Corpus_and_Machine-Readable_Dictionary_Data_for_Building_Bilingual_Lexicons","220355298_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue_on_Computational_Linguistics_Using_Large_Corpora","220355244_Class-Based_n-gram_Models_of_Natural_Language","200045115_A_Spreading_Activation_Theory_of_Semantic_Processing","42092426_Designing_Statistical_Language_Learners_Experiments_on_Noun_Compounds","3113517_Development_and_application_of_a_metric_on_semantic_nets","304049855_Selection_and_Information_A_Class-Based_Approach_to_Lexical_Relationships","269675244_Chinese_Dictionaries_An_Extensive_Bibliography_of_Dictionaries_in_Chinese_and_Other_Languages","266278045_A_First_Course_in_Probability","265373194_Mathematical_Foundations_of_Information_Theory","259370517_Distinguishing_systems_and_distinguishing_senses_New_evaluation_methods_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation","246472275_Information_Retrieval_Based_on_Conceptual_Distance_in_IS-A_Hierarchies","246146039_Explorations_in_automatic_thesaurus_discovery","242378110_Automatic_Text_Processing","239562935_Information_Retrieval_Based_on_Conceptual_Distance_in_a_Is-a_Hierarchy_J_Doc_49_188-207","238727910_Contextual_correlates_of_synonymy","234764238_Augmenting_lexicons_automatically_Clustering_semantically_related_adjectives","232878134_Contextual_Correlates_of_Semantic_Similarity","230876772_Semantic_classes_and_syntactic_ambiguity","230876589_Empirical_Study_of_Predictive_Powers_of_Simple_Attachment_Schemes_for_Post-modifier_Prepositional_Phrases","230854795_WordNet_-_An_Electronical_Lexical_Database","230854746_Automatic_sense_disambiguation_using_machine_readable_dictionaries_How_to_tell_a_pine_cone_from_an_ice_cream_cone","229101051_Wordnet_An_online_lexical_database","226862766_An_occurrence-based_model_of_word_categorization","221995866_WordNet_An_Electronic_Lexical_Database","221613284_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_for_Free-text_Indexing_Using_a_Massive_Semantic_Network","221300451_Relevance_Feedback_Revisited","221299890_Use_of_Syntactic_Context_to_Produce_Term_Association_Lists_for_Text_Retrieval","221102495_Dynamic_Programming_Method_for_Analyzing_Conjunctive_Structures_in_Japanese","221101387_Lexical_Disambiguation_using_Simulated_Annealing","220688812_Computer_Systems_That_Learn_Classification_and_Prediction_Methods_from_Statistics_Neural_Nets_Machine_Learning_and_Expert_Systems","220481571_Similarity-Based_Approaches_to_Natural_Language_Processing","220419124_Large-Scale_Dictionary_Construction_for_Foreign_Language_Tutoring_and_Interlingual_Machine_Translation","220355304_Coping_with_Syntactic_Ambiguity_or_How_to_Put_the_Block_in_the_Box_on_the_Table","220147646_The_Top-Down_Strategy_for_Building_EuroWordNet_Vocabulary_Coverage_Base_Concepts_and_Top_Ontology","215439456_Features_of_Similarity","200003659_Frequency_Analysis_of_English_Usage_Lexicon_and_Grammar","14217172_Selectional_constraints_An_information-theoretic_model_and_its_computational_realization","12994573_Ranking_documents_with_a_thesaurus","3178307_Estimation_of_probabilities_from_sparse_data_for_the_language_model_component_of_a_speech_recognizer","2720890_An_Information-Theoretic_Definition_of_Similarity","2642815_Noun_Homograph_Disambiguation_Using_Local_Context_in_Large_Text_Corpora","2599552_Using_Information_Content_to_Evaluate_Semantic_Similarity_in_a_Taxonomy","2257983_Using_WordNet_as_a_Knowledge_Base_for_Measuring_Semantic_Similarity_between_Words","1782380_Conceptual_Association_for_Compound_Noun_Analysis","2251001_A_Perspective_on_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Methods_and_Their_Evaluation","1782856_The_Grammar_of_Sense_Is_word-sense_tagging_much_more_than_part-of-speech_tagging","1782467_Analysis_of_Japanese_Compound_Nouns_using_Collocational_Information"]}
