{"id":"330478994_Info-Trust_A_Multi-Criteria_and_Adaptive_Trustworthiness_Calculation_Mechanism_for_Information_Sources","abstract":"Social media have become increasingly popular for the sharing and spreading of usergenerated content due to their easy access, fast dissemination, and low cost. Meanwhile, social media also enable the wide propagation of cyber frauds, which leverage fake information sources to reach an ulterior goal. The prevalence of untrustworthy information sources on social media can have significant negative societal effects. In a trustworthy social media system, trust calculation technology has become a key demand for identification of information sources. Trust, as one of the most complex concepts in network communities, has multi-criteria properties. However, existing work only focuses on single trust factor, and does not fully consider the complexity of trust relationships in social computing. In this paper, a multi-criteria trustworthiness calculation mechanism called Info-Trust is proposed for information sources, in which identity-based trust, behavior-based trust, relation-based trust, and feedback-based trust factors are incorporated to present an accuracy-enhanced full view of trustworthiness evaluation of information sources. More importantly, the weights of these factors are dynamically assigned by the ordered weighted averaging and weighted moving average (OWA-WMA) combination algorithm. This mechanism surpasses the limitations of existing approaches in which weights are assigned subjectively. Experimental results based on real-world datasets from SinaWeibo demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves greater accuracy and adaptability in trustworthiness identification of network information.","authors":["Yali Gao","Xiaoyong Li","Jirui Li","Yunquan Gao"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893657"],"references":["323153789_Understanding_User_Profiles_on_Social_Media_for_Fake_News_Detection","320839700_GANG_Detecting_Fraudulent_Users_in_Online_Social_Networks_via_Guilt-by-Association_on_Directed_Graphs","319408946_Random_Walk_Based_Fake_Account_Detection_in_Online_Social_Networks","318981549_Fake_News_Detection_on_Social_Media_A_Data_Mining_Perspective","318671211_The_spread_of_fake_news_by_social_bots","317506206_SybilSCAR_Sybil_Detection_in_Online_Social_Networks_via_Local_Rule_based_Propagation","311165092_Malicious_accounts_Dark_of_the_social_networks","301444934_A_Multistage_Credibility_Analysis_Model_for_Microblogs","282914403_Selecting_the_Best_Open_Source_Tools_for_Collecting_and_Visualizing_Social_Media_Content","282352913_Profiling_Online_Social_Behaviors_for_Compromised_Account_Detection","281787851_A_Topic-focused_Trust_Model_for_Twitter","281768604_Towards_Detecting_Compromised_Accounts_on_Social_Networks","265543350_An_analytic_approach_for_obtaining_maximal_entropy_OWA_operator_weights","265514424_Ordered_Weighted_Averaging_Operators_1988-2014_A_Citation-Based_Literature_Survey","224145761_Measuring_behavioral_trust_in_social_networks","222372405_Forecasting_enrollments_with_fuzzy_time_series_-_Part_I","221108153_A_Social_Network-Based_Trust_Model_for_the_Semantic_Web","221021979_Trust_in_wikipedia_how_users_trust_information_from_an_unknown_source","220876041_Finding_Credible_Information_Sources_in_Social_Networks_Based_on_Content_and_Social_Structure","316565370_Big_Search_in_Cyberspace","306524215_A_Credibility_Analysis_System_for_Assessing_Information_on_Twitter","303507768_Understanding_Graph-Based_Trust_Evaluation_in_Online_Social_Networks_Methodologies_and_Challenges","303467666_Reputation-based_credibility_analysis_of_Twitter_social_network_users_Reputation-Based_Credibility_Analysis_of_Twitter_Social_Network_Users","282516969_Data-Driven_and_Feedback-Enhanced_Trust_Computing_Pattern_for_Large-Scale_Multi-Cloud_Collaborative_Services","277949909_Trust_Evaluation_in_Online_Social_Networks_Using_Generalized_Network_Flow","277520895_A_survey_of_trust_in_social_networks_ACM_Comput","276853541_T-Broker_A_Trust-Aware_Service_Brokering_Scheme_for_Multiple_Cloud_Collaborative_Services","273176664_Rooting_our_Rumor_Sources_in_Online_Social_Networks_The_Value_of_Diversity_From_Multiple_Observations","270793613_Service_Operator-Aware_Trust_Scheme_for_Resource_Matchmaking_across_Multiple_Clouds","262286190_Multi-source_deep_learning_for_information_trustworthiness_estimation","260299667_LDTS_A_Lightweight_and_Dependable_Trust_System_for_Clustered_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","254018052_SWTrust_Generating_Trusted_Graph_for_Trust_Evaluation_in_Online_Social_Networks","243786854_Computing_and_Applying_Trust_in_Web-Based_Social_Networks","237132366_The_Ordered_Weighted_Averaging_Operators_Theory_and_Applications","236628761_Netlogo","228328565_On_Ordered_Weighted_Averaging_Aggregation_Operators_in_Multicriteria_Decisionmaking","220380327_A_multi-dimensional_trust_evaluation_model_for_large-scale_P2P_computing","51913660_Uncovering_Social_Network_Sybils_in_the_Wild","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks","3336374_On_the_properties_of_OWA_operator_weights_functions_with_constant_level_of_orness","2431661_The_Social_Cost_of_Cheap_Pseudonyms"]}
