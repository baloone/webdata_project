{"id":"320603328_Evaluation_of_Cost_Drivers_for_Field_Canals_Improvement_Projects","abstract":"Field Canals Improvement Project (FCIP) aims to conserve fresh water. Several methods are existed to predict project preliminary cost. However, identification of model inputs remains a challenging task during model development. This study utilizes two procedures, Traditional Delphi Method (TDM) and Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM), which are used for collecting and initially ranking cost drivers. According to the second approach, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used for finally ranking the screened parameters by FDM. Delphi rounds and Likert scale are conducted to determine the most important factors from the viewpoint of consultant engineers and contractors. Regression analysis and R square is used as a comparison criteria between traditional technique and fuzzy techniques. The study suggests using Fuzzy theory and Delphi method with Analytic Hierarchy Process in order to identify cost drivers efficiently. Paper contribution is proposing a methodology to evaluate cost drivers of FCIP using qualitative data such as expertsâ€™ opinions.","authors":["Haytham H. Elmousalami","Ahmed Elyamany","A.H.
