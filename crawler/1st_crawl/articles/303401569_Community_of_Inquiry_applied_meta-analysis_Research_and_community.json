{"id":"303401569_Community_of_Inquiry_applied_meta-analysis_Research_and_community","abstract":"This presentation reports initial findings from phase one of an applied meta-analysis of empirical quantitative studies based on the Community Inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison, Anderson and Archer, 2000) and the Community of Inquiry instrument (Arbaugh et al., 2008). A research alliance comprised of Drs. M. Cleveland-Innes, D. R. Garrison, M. Koole, N. Vaughan, and doctoral student, M. Befus, analyzed 73 quantitative and mixed-methods empirical studies citing the Garrison et al., 2000, Arbaugh et al. (2008) and using the CoI instrument. The 73 short-listed studies were categorized by educational context, study focus (theoretical review, empirical test, or practical application), and then analyzed for research methodology, original data or secondary data to determine which, if any, patterns are emerging in quantitative research being done on the CoI Framework utilizing the CoI instrument.","authors":["Madelaine Kaye Kineshanko","Martha Cleveland-Innes","D.
