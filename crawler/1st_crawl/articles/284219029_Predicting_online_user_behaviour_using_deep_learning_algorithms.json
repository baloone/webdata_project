{"id":"284219029_Predicting_online_user_behaviour_using_deep_learning_algorithms","abstract":"We propose a robust classifier to predict buying intentions based on user\nbehaviour within a large e-commerce website. In this work we compare\ntraditional machine learning techniques with the most advanced deep learning\napproaches. We show that both Deep Belief Networks and Stacked Denoising\nauto-Encoders achieved a substantial improvement by extracting features from\nhigh dimensional data during the pre-train phase. They prove also to be more\nconvenient to deal with severe class imbalance.","authors":["Armando Vieira"],"meta":["November 2015","SourcearXiv","Project: Writing a book on business applications of deep learning"],"references":["288774104_Discovering_Consumers'_Purchase_Intentions_Based_on_Mobile_Search_Behaviors","264640590_Quantifying_the_semantics_of_search_behavior_before_stock_market_moves","262412214_Ad_click_prediction_a_view_from_the_trenches","261836614_Sequential_Click_Prediction_for_Sponsored_Search_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","254463616_Using_boosted_trees_for_click-through_rate_prediction_for_sponsored_search","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","228741582_Predicting_ads'_click-through_rate_with_decision_rules","225307589_Practical_Bayesian_Optimization_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms"]}
