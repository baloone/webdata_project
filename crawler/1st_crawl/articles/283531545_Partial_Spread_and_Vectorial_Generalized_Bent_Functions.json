{"id":"283531545_Partial_Spread_and_Vectorial_Generalized_Bent_Functions","abstract":"In this paper we generalize the partial spread class and completely describe\nit for generalized Boolean functions from $\\F_2^n$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^t}$.\nExplicitly, we describe gbent functions from $\\F_2^n$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^t}$,\nwhich can be seen as a gbent version of Dillon's $PS_{ap}$ class. For the first\ntime, we also introduce the concept of a vectorial gbent function from $\\F_2^n$\nto $\\Z_q^m$, and determine the maximal value which $m$ can attain for the case\n$q=2^t$. Finally we point to a relation between vectorial gbent functions and\nrelative difference sets.","authors":["Thor Martinsen","Wilfried Meidl","Pante Stănică"],"meta":["October 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 85(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0283-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["283531757_Generalized_bent_functions_and_their_Gray_images","276596482_Generalized_Bent_Functions_-_Some_General_Construction_Methods_and_Related_Necessary_and_Sufficient_Conditions","315650306_Complete_Characterization_of_Generalized_Bent_and_2_k_-Bent_Boolean_Functions","314711203_Generalized_Bent_Functions_and_Their_Gray_Images","296691433_Generalized_Rothaus_construction_and_non-weakly_regular_bent_functions","273393789_Highly_Nonlinear_Balanced_S-Boxes_With_Good_Differential_Properties","265334005_Elementary_Hadamard_difference_sets","257555092_Bent_functions_on_partial_spreads","257554880_Bent_and_generalized_bent_Boolean_functions","256391988_On_bent_functions"]}
