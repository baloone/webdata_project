{"id":"345661938_Adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_inference_system_for_deburring_stage_classification_and_prediction_for_indirect_quality_monitoring","abstract":"Manufacturing of aerospace components consists of combination of different types of machining, finishing, and measuring processes. One of the finishing processes is deburring, i.e. a finishing process to remove burrs from work coupons after a boring hole process. Deburring is conducted to achieve required surface finish quality prior to further processes in assembly line. This paper introduces sensor data analysis as a tool to quantify and correlate the deburring stage with the features extracted from sensors data. This study covers signal processing, feature extraction and analytical method to determine its relevancy to the surface finish quality from deburring process. Wavelet decomposition and Welchâ€™s spectrum estimate is used as a signal processing and feature extraction method. Consequently, the features are used as the basis for analysis by adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The ANFIS yields the output corresponding to the predicted surface finish quality in terms of boss hole chamfer length and the stage classification of deburring process. The results show a decreasing trend in measured vibration signal, which is qualitatively well correlated to the deburring stage and the development of chamfer length during deburring process.","authors":["Wahyu Caesarendra","Tomi Wijaya","Tegoeh Tjahjowidodo","Bobby Pappachan"],"meta":["November 2018Applied Soft Computing 72:565-578","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2018.01.008"],"references":["329163993_In-process_tool_condition_monitoring_in_compliant_abrasive_belt_grinding_process_using_support_vector_machine_and_genetic_algorithm","317257128_Frequency_Domain_Analysis_of_Sensor_Data_for_Event_Classification_in_Real-Time_Robot_Assisted_Deburring","299400280_Computer_Aided_Detection_of_Cervical_Cancer_Using_Pap_Smear_Images_Based_on_Adaptive_Neuro_Fuzzy_Inference_System_Classifier","262337424_A_Survey_on_Artificial_Intelligence-Based_Modeling_Techniques_for_High_Speed_Milling_Processes","262056551_CCIoT-CMfg_Cloud_Computing_and_Internet_of_Things-Based_Cloud_Manufacturing_Service_System","261302472_An_application_of_nonlinear_feature_extraction_-_A_case_study_for_low_speed_slewing_bearing_condition_monitoring_and_prognosis","223408539_Tool_condition_monitoring_in_drilling_using_vibration_signature_analysis","7384980_Application_of_Support_Vector_Machine_to_Cancer_Classification_with_Microarray_Data","3113825_ANFIS_Adaptive-Network-based_Fuzzy_Inference_System","259991951_Circular_domain_features_based_condition_monitoring_for_low_speed_slewing_bearing","257272115_Recent_advances_in_time-frequency_analysis_methods_for_machinery_fault_diagnosis_A_review_with_application_examples","256842190_Data_driven_modeling_based_on_dynamic_parsimonious_fuzzy_neural_network","246664365_Learning_and_Soft_Computing_Support_Vector_Machines_Neural_Networks_and_Fuzzy_Logic_Models","225329151_A_review_of_machining_monitoring_systems_based_on_artificial_intelligence_process_models_International_Journal_of_Advanced_Manufacturing_Technology_47_237-257"]}
