{"id":"332640055_Extended_Rectangular_b-Metric_Spaces_and_Some_Fixed_Point_Theorems_for_Contractive_Mappings","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the class of extended rectangular b-metric spaces as a generalization of both rectangular metric and rectangular b-metric spaces. In addition, some fixed point results connected with certain contractions are obtained and examples are given to illustrate these results.","authors":["Zead Mustafa","Vahid Parvaneh","M. M. M.
