{"id":"237059642_Deformable_Medical_Image_Registration_A_Survey","abstract":"Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing. Among its most important applications, one may cite: i) multi-modality fusion, where information acquired by different imaging devices or protocols is fused to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning; ii) longitudinal studies, where temporal structural or anatomical changes are investigated; and iii) population modeling and statistical atlases used to study normal anatomical variability. In this paper, we attempt to give an overview of deformable registration methods, putting emphasis on the most recent advances in the domain. Additional emphasis has been given to techniques applied to medical images. In order to study image registration methods in depth, their main components are identified and studied independently. The most recent techniques are presented in a systematic fashion. The contribution of this paper is to provide an extensive account of registration techniques in a systematic manner.","authors":["Aristeidis Sotiras","Christos Davatzikos","Nikos Paragios"],"meta":["May 2013IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 32(7)","DOI:10.1109/TMI.2013.2265603","SourcePubMed"],"references":["329478758_Procrustes_Methods_in_the_Statistical_Analysis_of_Shape","324337656_Flows_in_Networks","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","314404294_Image_Warping_by_Radial_Basis_Functions_Application_to_Facial_Expressions","313636347_Free-form_deformation_of_solid_geometric_models","313576455_Robust_generalized_total_least_squares_iterative_closest_point_registration","313556846_Sift_flow_Dense_correspondence_across_scenes_and_its_applications","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points","313522833_PCA-SIFT_A_more_distinctive_representation_for_local_image_descriptors","313505421_Completely_derandomized_self-adaptation_in_evolution_strategies"]}
