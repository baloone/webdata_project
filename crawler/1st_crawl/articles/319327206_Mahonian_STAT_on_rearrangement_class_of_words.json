{"id":"319327206_Mahonian_STAT_on_rearrangement_class_of_words","abstract":"In 2000, Babson and Steingr\\'{i}msson generalized the notion of permutation patterns to the so-called vincular patterns, and they showed that many Mahonian statistics can be expressed as sums of vincular pattern occurrence statistics. STAT is one of such Mahonian statistics discoverd by them. In 2016, Kitaev and the third author introduced a words analogue of STAT and proved a joint equidistribution result involving two sextuple statistics on the whole set of words with fixed length and alphabet. Moreover, their computer experiments hinted at a finer involution on $R(w)$, the rearrangement class of a given word $w$. We construct such an involution in this paper, which yields a comparable joint equidistribution between two sextuple statistics over $R(w)$. Our involution builds on Burstein's involution and Foata-Sch\\\"{u}tzenberger's involution that utilizes the celebrated RSK algorithm.","authors":["Shishuo Fu","Ting Hua","Vincent Vajnovszki"],"meta":["August 2017Discrete Applied Mathematics 270","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2019.06.010","Project: Patterns and Statistics"],"references":["281299448_On_joint_distribution_of_adjacencies_descents_and_some_Mahonian_statistics","318670776_Equidistributions_of_MAJ_and_STAT_over_pattern_avoiding_permutations","316955496_Equidistributions_of_Mahonian_Statistics_over_Pattern_Avoiding_Permutations","268992235_Patterns_in_Permutations_and_Words","266959390_Quelques_remarques_sur_une_Construction_de_Schensted","266060963_The_k-Extension_of_a_Mahonian_Statistic","246076812_Enumerative_combinatorics_Vol_I","240371965_Une_transformation_fondamentale_sure_les_r'earrangements_de_mots","234830142_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_1_Fascicle_1_MMIX_--_A_RISC_Computer_for_the_New_Millennium_Art_of_Computer_Programming","229713120_Major_Index_and_Inversion_Number_of_Permutations"]}
