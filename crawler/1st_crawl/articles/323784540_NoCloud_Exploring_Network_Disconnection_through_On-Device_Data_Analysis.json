{"id":"323784540_NoCloud_Exploring_Network_Disconnection_through_On-Device_Data_Analysis","abstract":"Application developers often advocate uploading data to the cloud for analysis or storage, primarily due to concerns about the limited computational capability of ubiquitous devices. Today, however, many such devices can still effectively operate and execute complex algorithms without reliance on the cloud. The authors recommend prioritizing on-device analysis over uploading the data to another host, and if on-device analysis is not possible, favoring local network services over a cloud service.","authors":["Reza Rawassizadeh","Timothy J.
