{"id":"262273022_On_the_Logical_Foundations_of_Moral_Agency","abstract":"The aim of this work is to provide a logical analysis of moral agency. Although this concept has been extensively studied in social philosophy and in social sciences, it has been far less studied in the field of deontic logic and multi-agent systems (MASs). We discuss different aspects of moral agency such as the distinction between desires and moral values and the concept of moral agent. All these concepts are formalized in a variant of STIT logic with explicit actions.","authors":["Emiliano Lorini"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31570-1_8","Conference: Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Deontic Logic in Computer Science"],"references":["253241037_BIO_Logical_Agents_Norms_Beliefs_Intentions_in_Defeasible_Logic","226540414_Everything_Else_Being_Equal_A_Modal_Logic_for_Ceteris_Paribus_Preferences","46624672_Goal_Generation_in_the_BOID_Architecture","5003080_Theories_of_Fairness_and_Reciprocity_--_Evidence_and_Economic_Applications","4721017_Guilt_in_Games","345796740_Morality_and_the_theory_of_rational_behaviour","329645603_Knowledge_in_Action_Logical_Foundations_for_Specifying_and_Implementing_Dynamical_Systems","266171715_Epistemic_logic_and_the_foundations_of_decision_and_game_theory","247334419_Rational_Fools_A_Critique_of_the_Behavioral_Foundations_of_Economic_Theory","246869743_Morality_and_the_Theory_of_Rational_Behavior","244452427_Agency_and_Deontic_Logic","242608877_Knowledge_in_action_Logical_foundations_for_specifying_and_implementing_dynamical_systems","239583242_Combinations_of_Tense_and_Modality","220702345_A_Logical_Analysis_of_the_Interaction_between_'Obligation-to-do'_and_'Knowingly_Doing'","220546183_Intention_is_Choice_with_Commitment","220441298_A_dynamic_logic_of_agency_I_STIT_capabilities_and_powers","220315983_Branching-Time_Logic_with_Quantification_over_Brances_The_Point_of_View_of_Modal_Logic","200027282_Rationality_in_Action","4721379_Rational_Expectations_in_Games"]}
