{"id":"223321781_Blind_and_robust_audio_watermarking_scheme_based_on_SVD-DCT","abstract":"Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a new and important transform technique in robust digital watermarking due to its different properties from the traditional transforms such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this paper, we propose a new, blind and robust audio watermarking scheme based on SVD–DCT with the synchronization code technique. We embed a binary watermark into the high-frequency band of the SVD–DCT block blindly. Chaotic sequence is adopted as the synchronization code and inserted into the host signal. Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking method is comparable to, if not, better than SVD based method and several selected typical audio watermarking methods, even in the presence of various common signal processing attacks.","authors":["Bai Ying Lei","I.Y.
