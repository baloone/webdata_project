{"id":"320511285_Ethics_Problems_in_the_New_Public_Service_Back_to_a_Service_Ethic","abstract":"This article argues that ethical compliance under the New Public Service presents a number of challenges not readily addressed under the ethical considerations of traditional public administration or the New Public Management. Specifically, citizens have limited capacity as coproducers aside from the traditional democratic role of service requests. Team production problems can arise under such coproductive arrangements that incentivize either shirking or rent-seeking behaviors. These problems, while certainly ethical, have structural priors that must be addressed before a solution can be pursued. The article argues that structural elements are addressed in the changing relationship between the bureaucracy and elected authority, but that a solution to the remaining ethical issues is found in a return to the service ethic.","authors":["Jonathan Rauh"],"meta":["October 2017Public Integrity 20(5):1-23","DOI:10.1080/10999922.2017.1381541"],"references":["309187335_A_History_of_the_Team_Production_Theory","306315054_Uncharted_Territoriality_in_Coproduction_The_Motivations_for_311_Reporting","304851870_Formal_theory_and_public_administration","347343128_Handbook_of_Administrative_Ethics","345802194_Political_Economy_for_Public_Policy","344501101_Citizenship_and_the_Ethics_of_Care_Feminist_Considerations_on_Justice_Morality_and_Politics","335449416_The_Inherently_Unethical_Nature_of_Public_Service_Ethics","331786903_Feminist_Moral_Inquiry_and_the_Feminist_Future_1993","324281841_A_Preface_to_Democratic_Theory","313584367_The_Mask_of_Administrative_Evil"]}
