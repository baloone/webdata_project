{"id":"323328890_Aerial_Manipulation_A_Literature_Review","abstract":"Aerial manipulation aims at combining the versatility and the agility of some aerial platforms with the precision and the dexterity of robotic arms. This letter tries to collect the results reached by the research community so far within the field of aerial manipulation, specially from the technological and control point of view. A brief literature review about general aerial robotics and space manipulation is carried out as well.","authors":["Fabio Ruggiero","Vincenzo Lippiello","Anibal Ollero"],"meta":["July 2018IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters 3(3):1957-1964","DOI:10.1109/LRA.2018.2808541"],"references":["317690030_Fast_Trajectory_Optimization_for_Agile_Quadrotor_Maneuvers_with_a_Cable-Suspended_Payload","316325963_Cable-suspended_load_lifting_by_a_quadrotor_UAV_hybrid_model_trajectory_generation_and_control","314584837_Dynamics_Control_and_Planning_for_Cooperative_Manipulation_of_Payloads_Suspended_by_Cables_from_Multiple_Quadrotor_Robots","314151361_Towards_Robotic_MAGMaS_Multiple_Aerial-Ground_Manipulator_Systems","325369967_Robotics_Modelling_planning_and_control","321818731_Anthropomorphic_compliant_and_lightweight_dual_arm_system_for_aerial_manipulation","319026238_Lightweight_and_human-size_dual_arm_aerial_manipulator","312370655_Autonomous_Flying_Robots_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles_and_Micro_Aerial_Vehicles","312343085_Coordinating_locomotion_and_manipulation_of_a_mobile_manipulator","312158810_First_Analysis_and_Experiments_in_Aerial_Manipulation_Using_fully_Actuated_Redundant_Robot_Arm","312139246_DLR's_Advanced_Telerobotic_Concepts_and_Experiments_for_On-Orbit_Servicing","311754844_Impedance_Control_of_an_aerial-manipulator_Preliminary_results","308824126_Lightweight_compliant_arm_for_aerial_manipulation","308792527_Takeoff_and_Landing_on_Slopes_via_Inclined_Hovering_with_a_Tethered_Aerial_Robot","308728916_A_parallel_manipulator_for_mobile_manipulating_UAVs"]}
