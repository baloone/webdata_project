Firstly, they decomposed the annual input variables like the net head of the turbine, and flow rate of water into a certain number of detail signals through artificial neural network (ANN) transform. ANN model used to predict the annual power generation. After the stationary simulation prediction model is obtained, the prediction results were superposed. Secondly, based on hydro power generation stability theory, a novel normalized firefly fuzzy control method (NFANN) is designed for stability control of a hydro - turbine system. Thirdly, the control method has almost good robustness, which could resist the random disturbances. Finally, simulation results have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of this new approach when compared with the existing one.","authors":["Ali Thaeer Hammid","Mohd Herwan Sulaiman","Younis Kadthem Hameed"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems 10(10-Special Issue):1379-1392","Project: Optimization and Control of Hydro Generation Scheduling using Hybrid Firefly Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization Techniques"],"references":["322334640_Fuzzy_PD_Plus_I_Control-based_Adaptive_Cruise_Control_System_in_Simulation_and_Real-time_Environment","322265995_Optimum_Power_Production_of_Small_Hydropower_Plant_SHP_using_Firefly_Algorithm_FA_in_Himreen_Lake_Dam_HLD_Eastern_Iraq","315908006_Present_and_Future_for_Hydropower_Developments_in_Kurdistan","320995636_Optimal_Distributed_Generation_Allocation_Using_a_New_Metaheuristic","318683873_Harmonic_Level_Minimization_Using_Neuro-Fuzzy-Based_SVPWM","318303150_Transcriptomes_from_the_photogenic_and_non-photogenetic_tissues_and_life_stages_of_the_Aspisoma_lineatum_firefly_Coleoptera_Lampyridae_Implications_for_the_evolutionary_origins_of_bioluminescence_and_","318206853_Optimization_of_modular_granular_neural_networks_using_a_firefly_algorithm_for_human_recognition","317746198_A_Hybrid_Multi-Objective_Firefly_Algorithm_for_Big_Data_Optimization","316781821_Spatial_interpolation_and_radiological_mapping_of_ambient_gamma_dose_rate_by_using_artificial_neural_networks_and_fuzzy_logic_methods","315977760_Extended_Fuzzy_Hyperline-Segment_Neural_Network_with_Classification_Rule_Extraction"]}
