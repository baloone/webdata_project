{"id":"304621295_Static_VS_Dynamic_Reversibility_in_CCS","abstract":"The notion of reversible computing is attracting interest because of its applications in diverse fields, in particular the study of programming abstractions for fault tolerant systems. Reversible CCS (RCCS), proposed by Danos and Krivine, enacts reversibility by means of memory stacks. Ulidowski and Phillips proposed a general method to reverse a process calculus given in a particular SOS format, by exploiting the idea of making all the operators of a calculus static. CCSK is then derived from CCS with this method. In this paper we show that RCCS is at least as expressive as CCSK.","authors":["Doriana Medic","Claudio Antares Mezzina"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-40578-0_3","Conference: International Conference on Reversible Computation"],"references":["280752222_Causal-Consistent_Reversible_Debugging","266486900_A_Verification_Technique_for_Reversible_Process_Algebra","262279575_Concurrent_Flexible_Reversibility","221685153_Information_and_thermodynamics_Experimental_verification_of_Landauer's_erasure_principle","220700934_Reversible_Communicating_Systems","220700366_Transactions_in_RCCS","283364215_A_Reversible_Process_Calculus_and_the_Modelling_of_the_ERK_Signalling_Pathway","266425464_The_p-Calculus_A_Theory_of_Mobile_Processes","257548574_Reverse_computation_for_rollback-based_fault_tolerance_in_large_parallel_systems_Evaluating_the_potential_gains_and_systems_effects","245624208_CCS-A_Calculus_for_Communicating_Systems","224105116_Irreversibility_and_Heat_Generation_in_the_Computing_Process","222783480_Reversing_Algebraic_Process_Calculi","220690132_The_Pi-Calculus_-_a_theory_of_mobile_processes","44398928_A_calculus_of_communicating_systems_Robin_Milner"]}
