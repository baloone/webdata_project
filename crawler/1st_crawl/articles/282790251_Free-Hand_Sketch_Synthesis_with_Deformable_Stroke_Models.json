{"id":"282790251_Free-Hand_Sketch_Synthesis_with_Deformable_Stroke_Models","abstract":"We present a generative model which can automatically summarize the stroke\ncomposition of free-hand sketches of a given category. When our model is fit to\na collection of sketches with similar poses, it discovers and learns the\nstructure and appearance of a set of coherent parts, with each part represented\nby a group of strokes. It represents both consistent (topology) as well as\ndiverse aspects (structure and appearance variations) of each sketch category.\nKey to the success of our model are important insights learned from a\ncomprehensive study performed on human stroke data. By fitting this model to\nimages, we are able to synthesize visually similar and pleasant free-hand\nsketches.","authors":["Yi Li","Yi-Zhe Song","Timothy Hospedales","Shaogang Gong"],"meta":["March 2017International Journal of Computer Vision 122(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11263-016-0963-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281742162_Making_Better_Use_of_Edges_via_Perceptual_Grouping","280305180_Sketch-a-Net_that_Beats_Humans","278242900_Sketch_Classification_and_Classification-driven_Analysis_Using_Fisher_Vectors","319770349_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_Challenge_Results","314785039_Animated_construction_of_line_drawings","314779249_How_do_humans_sketch_objects","312915478_From_images_to_shape_models_for_object_detection","286943772_Discriminatively_trained_sparse_code_gradients_for_contour_detection","283298682_Data-driven_Segmentation_and_Labeling_of_Freehand_Sketches","276949163_Human_facial_illustrations"]}
