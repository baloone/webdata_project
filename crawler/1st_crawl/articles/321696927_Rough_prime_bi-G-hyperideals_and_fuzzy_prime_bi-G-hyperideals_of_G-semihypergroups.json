{"id":"321696927_Rough_prime_bi-G-hyperideals_and_fuzzy_prime_bi-G-hyperideals_of_G-semihypergroups","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the concept of prime bi-Γ-hyperideals, rough prime bi-Γ-hyperideals and fuzzy prime bi-Γ-hyperideals of Γ-semihypergroups. We prove that the lower approximation of a prime bi-Γ-hyperideal is a prime bi-Γ-hyperideal and the upper approximation of a prime bi-Γ-hyperideal is a prime bi-Γ-hyperideal. Also the rough set theory is applied to prime bi-Γ-hyperideals in the quotient Γ-semihypergroups. In the end, the notion of fuzzy prime bi-Γ-hyperideals of Γ-semihypergroups has been introduced, and we proved that a bi-Γ-hyperideal B of a Γ-semihypergroup H is prime (resp., strongly prime) if and only if the characteristic function χB of B is a fuzzy prime (resp., fuzzy strongly prime) bi-Γ-hyperideal of H.","authors":["Naveed Yaqoob","Muhammad Aslam","Kostaq Hila","Bijan Davvaz"],"meta":["January 2017Filomat 31(13):4167-4183","DOI:10.2298/FIL1713167Y"],"references":["279113339_Structures_of_bipolar_fuzzy_G-hyperideals_in_G-semihypergroups","275066718_Generalized_Rough_G-Hyperideals_in_G-Semihypergroups","292301495_Associated_groups_for_a_semigroup","287457909_On_rough_m_n_bi-G-hyperideals_in_G-semihypergroups","285985470_Structures_of_fuzzy_G-hyperideals_in_G-semihypergroups","278074763_Generalized_rough_approximations_in_G-semihypergroups","275027639_ON_generalized_rough_m_N-Bi-g-Hyperideals_in_g-Semihypergroups","270680778_Prime_mn_Bi-G_-Hyperideals_in_G_-Semihypergroups","268894080_Fuzzy_hyperideals_in_semihypergroups","268072402_On_prime_mn_bi-ideals_and_rough_prime_mn_bi-ideals_in_semigroups"]}
