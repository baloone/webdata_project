{"id":"339955445_Virtual_reality_through_the_customer_journey_Framework_and_propositions","abstract":"While virtual reality's importance is increasingly recognized in marketing, its role in the customer journey remains nebulous. We define virtual reality through the customer journey (VRCJ) as firms' use of computer-mediated interactive environments capable of offering sensory feedback to engage consumers, strengthen consumer/brand relationships, and drive desired consumer behaviors at any stage of their journey. To better understand VRCJ, we classify VR archetypes, formats, and content features, followed by the development of a conceptual framework and an associated set of propositions of VRCJ. We conclude by discussing important theoretical and practical implications that arise from our analyses.","authors":["Linda D.
