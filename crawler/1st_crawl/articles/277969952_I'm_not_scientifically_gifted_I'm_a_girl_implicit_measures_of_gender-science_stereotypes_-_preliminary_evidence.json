{"id":"277969952_I'm_not_scientifically_gifted_I'm_a_girl_implicit_measures_of_gender-science_stereotypes_-_preliminary_evidence","abstract":"Students often have a negative view on science, particularly women. Furthermore, academic level in math and science is usually considered as an innate ability. The aims of the study were to create an Implicit Association Test (IAT) in order to highlight the stereotype that science is innate, to identify if the gender of the participants impacts the results of this implicit measure and to compare self-report and implicit measures. Results showed that (1) science and innate are more easily associated in the IAT than liberal arts and innate, (2) women have a higher association of science and innate than men in the IAT (that is not the case in self-report measures).","authors":["Nicolas Mascret","Fran√ßois Cury"],"meta":["May 2015Educational Studies 41(4):1-4","DOI:10.1080/03055698.2015.1043979"],"references":["313564029_Self_Theories_Their_Impact_on_Competence_Motivation_and_Acquisition","11287650_Math_male_me_female_therefore_math_me","10614534_Understanding_and_Using_the_Implicit_Association_Test_I_An_Improved_Scoring_Algorithm","7131266_The_social-cognitive_model_of_achievement_motivation_and_the_2X2_achievement_framework","279800614_Understanding_and_Using_the_Implicit_Association_Test_I_An_Improved_Scoring_Algorithm","265092457_Math_Male_Me_Female_Therefore_Math_unequal_Me","256752763_It's_ok_-_Not_everyone_can_be_good_at_math_Instructors_with_an_entity_theory_comfort_and_demotivate_students","50408501_Math-Gender_Stereotypes_in_Elementary_School_Children"]}
