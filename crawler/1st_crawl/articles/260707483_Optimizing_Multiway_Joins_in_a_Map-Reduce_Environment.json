{"id":"260707483_Optimizing_Multiway_Joins_in_a_Map-Reduce_Environment","abstract":"Implementations of map-reduce are being used to perform many operations on very large data. We examine strategies for joining several relations in the map-reduce environment. Our new approach begins by identifying the “map-key,” the set of attributes that identify the Reduce process to which a Map process must send a particular tuple. Each attribute of the map-key gets a “share,” which is the number of buckets into which its values are hashed, to form a component of the identifier of a Reduce process. Relations have their tuples replicated in limited fashion, the degree of replication depending on the shares for those map-key attributes that are missing from their schema. We study the problem of optimizing the shares, given a fixed number of Reduce processes. An algorithm for detecting and fixing problems where a variable is mistakenly included in the map-key is given. Then, we consider two important special cases: chain joins and star joins. In each case, we are able to determine the map-key and determine the shares that yield the least replication. While the method we propose is not always superior to the conventional way of using map-reduce to implement joins, there are some important cases involving large-scale data where our method wins, including: 1) analytic queries in which a very large fact table is joined with smaller dimension tables, and 2) queries involving paths through graphs with high out-degree, such as the Web or a social network.","authors":["Foto Afrati","Jeffrey Ullman"],"meta":["September 2011IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 23(9):1282-1298","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2011.47"],"references":["234786051_SCOPE_Easy_and_efficient_parallel_processing_of_massive_data_sets","221351758_Dryad_Distributed_data-parallel_programs_from_sequential_building_blocks","221322340_Optimal_splitters_for_database_partitioning_with_size_bounds","221257383_Pregel_A_system_for_large-scale_graph_processing","221213884_An_Adaptive_Query_Execution_System_for_Data_Integration","221213434_A_Framework_for_the_Parallel_Processing_of_Datalog_Queries","220831914_NephelePACTs_A_programming_model_and_execution_framework_for_web-scale_analytical_processing","220538774_HaLoop_Efficient_Iterative_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","220072791_Optimizing_Multiway_Joins_in_a_Map-Reduce_Environment","200034291_Database_Systems_The_Complete_Book","4330921_Flow_Algorithms_for_Parallel_Query_Optimization","2558115_Continuously_Adaptive_Continuous_Queries_over_Streams","2424081_An_Adaptive_Query_Execution_System_for_Data_Integration","312917980_The_Google_file_system","312775005_MapReduce_Simplified_data_processing_on_large_clusters","306548354_Dryad_Distributed_data-parallel_programs_from_sequential_building_blocks","237912898_Authoritative_sources_in_a_hyperlinked_environment","235246933_Pig_Latin_A_Not-So-Foreign_Language_for_Data_Processing","234796124_Mixed-approach_algorithms_for_transitive_closure_extended_abstract","221559618_Mixed-Approach_Algorithms_for_Transitive_Closure","221559495_On_Tree-Based_Techniques_for_Query_Evaluation","221311547_Maximizing_the_Output_Rate_of_Multi-Way_Join_Queries_over_Streaming_Information_Sources","221310437_Query_Optimization_over_Web_Services","221213076_StreaMon_An_Adaptive_Engine_for_Stream_Query_Processing","220966040_Hyracks_A_flexible_and_extensible_foundation_for_data-intensive_computing","220910111_The_Google_File_System","220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","220538542_Clustera_An_integrated_computation_and_data_management_system","220538486_PNUTS_Yahoo's_hosted_data_serving_platform","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","220439168_Bigtable_A_Distributed_Storage_System_for_Structured_Data","220415473_A_Note_on_the_Strategy_Space_of_Multiway_Join_Query_Optimization_Problem_in_Parallel_Systems","220118181_Parallel_Bottom-Up_Processing_of_Datalog_Queries","200047922_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","200031515_Eddies_Continuously_Adaptive_Query_Processing","4133433_Adaptive_Caching_for_Continuous_Queries","3958207_Supporting_aggregate_queries_over_Ad-Hoc_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","2635797_Eddies_Continuously_Adaptive_Query_Processing","2454697_Kleinberg_J_Autoritive_success_in_a_hyper_linked_environment_J_ACM_5_604-632","2350388_Practical_Skew_Handling_in_Parallel_Joins"]}
