{"id":"235323873_Feature_Selection_for_Classfication","abstract":"Feature selection has been the focus of interest for quite some time and much work has been done. With the creation of huge databases and the consequent requirements for good machine learning techniques, new problems arise and novel approaches to feature selection are in demand. This survey is a comprehensive overview of many existing methods from the 1970's to the present. It identifies four steps of a typical feature selection method, and categorizes the different existing methods in terms of generation procedures and evaluation functions, and reveals hitherto unattempted combinations of generation procedures and evaluation functions. Representative methods are chosen from each category for detailed explanation and discussion via example. Benchmark datasets with different characteristics are used for comparative study. The strengths and weaknesses of different methods are explained. Guidelines for applying feature selection methods are given based on data types and domain characteris...","authors":["Manoranjan Dash","Huan Liu"],"meta":["December 1997Intelligent Data Analysis 1(1-4):131-156","DOI:10.1016/S1088-467X(97)00008-5","SourceDBLP"],"references":["257811559_Optimum_feature_selection_by_zero-one_integer_programming","242536822_Integer_Programming_by_Implicit_Enumeration_and_Balas'_Method","239990577_Feature_selection_for_linear_classifier","224663254_Best_first_strategy_for_feature_selection","221049224_Feature_Selection_and_Classification_-_A_Probabilistic_Wrapper_Approach","220814859_CABOT_An_Adaptive_Approach_to_Case-Based_Search","220343419_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","2799622_Feature_Selection_Methods_Genetic_Algorithms_vs_Greedy-like_Search","2417551_Irrelevant_Features_and_the_Subset_Selection_Problem","284643586_On_automatic_feature_selection","279540437_ON_FEATURE_SELECTION","263910649_ON_AUTOMATIC_FEATURE_SELECTION","246175668_Feature_selection_and_constructive_inference","246175419_Feature_Discovery_in_Empirical_Learning","246094141_Estimating_attributes_analysis_and_extension_of_relief","245375416_Analysis_and_extension_of_RELIEF","244487519_Pattern_Recognition_and_Reduction_of_Dimensionality","243720905_The_AQ15_inductive_learning_system_An_overview_and_experiments","242518806_Cluster_Analysis_A_Survey","240310918_Classification_and_Regression_Trees_CART","238748609_Pattern_Recognition_A_Statistical_Approach","238652351_An_evaluation_of_feature_selection_methods_and_their_application_to_computer_security","228599704_Boolean_feature_discovery_in_empirical_learning","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","226192677_The_CN2_Induction_algorithm","223041669_Learning_Boolean_Concepts_in_the_Presence_of_Many_Irrelevant_Features","222812561_Modeling_by_shortest_data_description","222684390_An_improved_branch_and_bound_algorithm_for_feature_selection","221605432_The_Feature_Selection_Problem_Traditional_Methods_and_a_New_Algorithm","221605389_Analyses_of_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","221605279_Learning_With_Many_Irrelevant_Features","221345735_A_Conservation_Law_for_Generalization_Performance","221112671_Feature_Selection_Using_Rough_Sets_Theory","220691618_Fundamentals_of_Algorithms","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","220329152_A_Branch_and_Bound_Algorithm_for_Feature_Subset_Selection","216300797_Very_Simple_Classification_Rules_Perform_Well_on_Most_Commonly_Used_Datasets","3504908_A_modeling_approach_to_feature_selection","3498898_Feature_selection_based_on_some_homogeneity_coefficient","3115490_Feature_Selection_for_Automatic_Classification_of_Non-Gaussian_Data","3045776_A_Comparison_of_Seven_Techniques_for_Choosing_Subsets_of_Pattern_Recognition_Properties","2828123_Using_Decision_Trees_to_Improve_Case-Based_Learning","2749444_Estimating_attributes_Analysis_and_extensions_of_RELIEF","2624523_Selection_of_Relevant_Features_in_Machine_Learning","2596032_Greedy_Attribute_Selection","2592906_Overfitting_Avoidance_as_Bias","2577864_Context-Sensitive_Feature_Selection_for_Lazy_Learners","2498665_Constructive_Induction_Using_a_Non-Greedy_Strategy_For_Feature_Selection","2454353_Toward_Optimal_Feature_Selection","2452562_Prototype_and_Feature_Selection_by_Sampling_and_Random_Mutation_Hill_Climbing_Algorithms","2354598_Feature_Subset_Selection_Using_the_Wrapper_Method_Overfitting_and_Dynamic_Search_Space_Topology","2293492_The_MONK's_Problems_A_Performance_Comparison_of_Different_Learning_Algorithms","2265508_Feature_Selection_And_Classification_-_A_Probabilistic_Wrapper_Approach","2362566_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Minimizing_Cross_Validation_Error","2251123_Efficiently_Inducing_Determinations_A_Complete_and_Systematic_Search_Algorithm_that_Uses_Optimal_Pruning"]}
