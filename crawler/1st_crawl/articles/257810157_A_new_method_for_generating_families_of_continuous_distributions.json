{"id":"257810157_A_new_method_for_generating_families_of_continuous_distributions","abstract":"In this paper, a new method is proposed for generating families of continuous distributions. A random variable \n\n$X$\n, “the transformer”, is used to transform another random variable \n\n$T$\n, “the transformed”. The resulting family, the \n\n$T$\n-\n\n$X$\nfamily of distributions, has a connection with the hazard functions and each generated distribution is considered as a weighted hazard function of the random variable \n\n$X$\n. Many new distributions, which are members of the family, are presented. Several known continuous distributions are found to be special cases of the new distributions.","authors":["Ayman Alzaatreh","Carl Lee","Felix Famoye"],"meta":["August 2013Metron 71(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40300-013-0007-y"],"references":["262801220_The_beta-Pareto_distribution","262800952_The_beta-Weibull_distribution","262800255_Beta-Normal_Distribution_Bimodality_Properties_and_Application","259981169_Gamma-Pareto_Distribution_and_Its_Applications","259981163_Gamma-Pareto_Distribution_and_Its_Applications","258515961_Weibull-Pareto_Distribution_and_Its_Applications","297179920_Some_Generalized_Functions_for_the_Size_Distribution_of_income","287609986_On_the_Properties_of_Beta-Gamma_Distribution","265586525_Univariate_and_multivariate_Burr_distributions_A_survey","265367747_Renyi_information_loglikelihood_and_an_intrinsic_distribution_measure"]}
