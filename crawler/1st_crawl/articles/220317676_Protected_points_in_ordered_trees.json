{"id":"220317676_Protected_points_in_ordered_trees","abstract":"In this note we start by computing the average number of protected points in all ordered trees with n edges. This can serve as a guide in various organizational schemes where it may be desirable to have a large or small number of protected points. We will also look a few subclasses with a view to increasing or decreasing the proportion of protected points.","authors":["Gi-Sang Cheon","Louis W.
