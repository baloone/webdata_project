{"id":"235798992_Space_Debris_Removal_with_an_Ion_Beam_Shepherd_Satellite_target-plasma_interaction","abstract":"A novel concept for active space debris removal known as Ion Beam Shepherd (IBS) which has been recently presented by our group is investigated. The concept makes use of a highly collimated ion beam to exert the necessary force on a generic debris to modify its orbit and/or attitude from a safe distance in a controlled manner, without the need of docking. After describing the main characteristics of the IBS system, some of the key aspects of thruster plasma and its interaction with the debris are studied, namely, (1) the modeling of the expansion of an plasma beam, based on the quasi-selfsimilarity exhibited by hypersonic plumes, (2) the characterization of the force and torque exerted upon the target debris, and (3) a preliminary evaluation of other plasma-body interactions.","authors":["Mario Merino","Eduardo Ahedo","Claudio Bombardelli","Hodei Urrutxua"],"meta":["July 2011","DOI:10.2514/6.2011-6142","Conference: $47^th$ AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference & ExhibitVolume: AIAA-2011-6142"],"references":["264785808_Plasma_Plume_Far_Field_Analysis","253967908_Xenon_charge_exchange_cross_sections_for_electrostatic_thruster_models","315449637_The_Stopping_and_Range_of_Ions_in_Matter","283930216_Comments_on_exhaust_flow_field_and_surface_impingement","268480509_3-D_Computation_of_Plasma_Thruster_Plumes","268456837_The_characteristics_of_the_EP_exhaust_plume_in_space","258975522_Fluid_mechanics_in_a_magnetoplasmadynamic_thruster","252313802_A_sensitivity_study_of_the_effectiveness_of_active_debris_removal_in_LEO","248081793_Three-Dimensional_Particle_Simulations_of_Ion_Propulsion_Plasma_Environment_for_Deep_Space_1","245437260_Ion-thruster_plume_modeling_for_backflow_contamination"]}
