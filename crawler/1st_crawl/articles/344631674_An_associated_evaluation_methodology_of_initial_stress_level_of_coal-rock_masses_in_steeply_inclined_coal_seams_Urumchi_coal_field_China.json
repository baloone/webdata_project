The KJ743 coal mine initial stress monitoring system was used to collect real-time initial stress data, which were used to check the accuracy of the analytical back results. The value of the vertical stress varied from 6.8 to 7.0 MPa, which is slightly smaller than the result of the back calculation. The minimum principal horizontal stress varied from 7.6 to 8.4 MPa, which is similar to the result of the back calculation.","authors":["Pengfei Shan","Xingping Lai"],"meta":["March 2020Engineering Computations 37(6):2177-2192","DOI:10.1108/EC-07-2019-0325"],"references":["333937462_Correlational_Analytical_Characterization_of_Energy_Dissipation-Liberation_and_Acoustic_Emission_during_Coal_and_Rock_Fracture_Inducing_by_Underground_Coal_Excavation","329258948_Topographic_effects_on_crustal_stress_around_the_Atera_Fault_central_Japan","326067968_Numerical_Simulation_of_the_Fluid-Solid_Coupling_Process_During_the_Failure_of_a_Fractured_Coal-Rock_Mass_Based_on_the_Regional_Geostress","313844603_Back_Analysis_of_Geomechanical_Parameters_of_Rock_Masses_Based_on_Seepage-Stress_Coupled_Analysis","293804618_Finite_Element_Optimised_Back_Analysis_of_In_Situ_Stress_Field_and_Stability_Analysis_of_Shaft_Wall_in_the_Underground_Gas_Storage","288992835_Back_analysis_of_rock_mass_parameters_and_initial_stress_for_the_Longtan_tunnel_in_China","279190169_Influence_of_Initial_Stress_and_Inhomogeneity_on_Propagation_of_Torsional_Type_Surface_Wave_in_a_Crustal_Layer","277579334_Simulation_of_Asymmetric_Destabilization_of_Mine-void_Rock_Masses_Using_a_Large_3D_Physical_Model","332788938_Correlational_fractal_characterisation_of_stress_and_acoustic_emission_during_coal_and_rock_failure_under_multilevel_dynamic_loading","329496883_Contemporary_crustal_stress_of_the_Greek_region_deduced_from_earthquake_focal_mechanisms","329463222_Influence_of_CT_scanning_parameters_on_rock_and_soil_images","327061751_The_World_Stress_Map_database_release_2016_Crustal_stress_pattern_across_scales","325379302_Crustal_anisotropy_and_state_of_stress_at_Uturuncu_Volcano_Bolivia_from_shear-wave_splitting_measurements_and_magnitude-frequency_distributions_in_seismicity","321067085_Elasticity_solution_for_the_casing_under_linear_crustal_stress","318280420_Optimized_back_analysis_method_for_stress_determination_based_on_identification_of_local_stress_measurements_and_its_application","284562678_Luminescent_carbon_quantum_dots_with_high_quantum_yield_as_a_single_white_converter_for_white_light_emitting_diodes","245472816_Some_elements_of_a_theory_for_In-situ_stress","200116978_Back_analysis_of_model_parameters_in_geotechnical_engineering_by_means_of_soft_computing"]}
