{"id":"254861146_Two-step_spin_conversion_and_other_effects_in_the_atom-phonon_coupling_model","abstract":"We study an atom-phonon coupling model introduced recently for spin-conversion phenomenon.\nThe originality of this model, performed on a linear chain of atoms, is that the elastic force constant values\nof the spring linking two atoms depends on their electronic states. This leads to introduce naturally in\nthe chain long- and short-range interactions, which appear respectively like a Zeeman and an exchange\ninteractions. The exchange-like interaction can be ferro-, antiferro- or equal to zero. The effects of longrange\ninteractions have already been studied. Here we study those of the short-range interaction. Some\nparts of the chain phase diagram are analysed and the main features of the experimental behaviours of\nspin conversion compounds are qualitatively reproduced.","authors":["JA Nasser","Kamel Boukheddaden","Jorge Linares"],"meta":["May 2004The European Physical Journal B 39(2):219-227","DOI:10.1140/epjb/e2004-00184-y"],"references":["243457324_Ising-like_model_for_the_two-step_spin-crossover","231112468_The_elastic_interaction_of_high-spin_and_low-spin_complex_molecules_in_spin-crossover_compounds","228782819_Examples_of_molecular_switching_in_inorganic_solids_due_to_temperature_light_pressure_and_magnetic_field","222757599_Phonon_coupled_cooperative_low-spin_1A1high-spin_5T2_transition_in_Fephen2NCS2_and_Fephen2NCSe2_crystals","264511778_Thermal_and_Optical_Switching_of_IronII_Complexes","248838820_Pressure_effect_on_a_novel_spin_transition_polymeric_chain_compound","235548337_Dynamic_response_of_the_spin-crossover_solid_Co_H_2fsa_2_enpy_2_to_a_pulsed_magnetic_field","235467313_Low-Spin-High-Spin_Transitions_in_Transition-Metal-Ion_Compounds","234981044_Theory_of_high-spinlow-spin_transitions_in_transition_metal_compounds_induced_by_the_Jahn-Teller_effect","234335084_Unusual_spin-transition_anomaly_in_the_crossover_system_Fe2-pic3Cl2EtOH","231245692_The_nature_of_spin-state_transitions_in_solid_complexes_of_ironII_and_the_interpretation_of_some_associated_phenomena","229278617_Nature_of_the_phase_transition_in_spin_crossover_compounds","227170847_First_order_high-spinlow-spin_phase_transition_induced_by_acoustic-phonons","223166345_A_model_for_high-spinlow-spin_transitions_in_solids_including_the_effect_of_lattice_vibrations","222181997_Spin_crossover_in_ironII_tris2-2'-pyridylbenzimidazole_complex_monitored_by_variable_temperature_methods_synchrotron_powder_diffraction_DSC_IR_spectra_Mossbauer_spectra_and_magnetic_susceptibility","43293336_Modele_de_fonction_aleatoire_de_couverture_applicable_aux_phenomenes_de_filiation_a_base_poissonnienne","11940807_Strong_Cooperativeness_in_the_Mononuclear_IronII_Derivative_Exhibiting_an_Abrupt_Spin_Transition_above_400_K"]}
