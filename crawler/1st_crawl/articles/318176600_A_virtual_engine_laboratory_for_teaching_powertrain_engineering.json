{"id":"318176600_A_virtual_engine_laboratory_for_teaching_powertrain_engineering","abstract":"A virtual engine laboratory application for use in automotive engineering education is proposed to allow the practical teaching of powertrain calibration. The laboratory software is built as a flexible Matlab tool that can easily be transferred for applications in other disciplines and promotes the link between teaching and research.","authors":["Richard Burke","Nicholas De Jonge","Calo Avola","Biagio Forte"],"meta":["June 2017Computer Applications in Engineering Education 25(6)","DOI:10.1002/cae.21847"],"references":["281374905_Impact_of_Combination_of_EGR_SCR_and_DPF_Technologies_for_the_Low-Emission_Rail_Diesel_Engines","266277038_Review_of_Thermodynamic_Diesel_Engine_Simulations_under_Transient_Operating_Conditions","258487476_Dynamic_modelling_of_diesel_engine_emissions_using_the_parametric_Volterra_series","236228553_Physical_and_Virtual_Laboratories_in_Science_and_Engineering_Education","236178694_A_Virtual_Laboratory_for_Education_on_Gas_Turbine_Principles_and_Operation","228591241_Virtual_Laboratories_for_Engineering_Education","227777541_Virtual_laboratories_in_engineering_education_The_simulation_lab_and_remote_lab","347494347_The_Lecturer's_Toolkit_A_Practical_Guide_to_Assessment_Learning_and_Teaching","300907423_Internal_combustion_engine_calibration_teaching_by_Stand_Alone_System","288456509_Hardware-in-the-Loop_Testing_of_Engine_Control_Units_-_A_Technical_Survey","284834451_Model-Based_Engine_Calibration_-_A_Challenge_for_Teaching","280965348_Statistics_for_Experimenters_Design_Innovation_and_Discovery","275468410_Data-driven_emission_model_structures_for_diesel_engine_management_system_development","274874427_Analysis_and_Modeling_of_the_Transient_Thermal_Behavior_of_Automotive_Turbochargers","258510769_Statistics_for_experimenters_Design_innovation_and_discovery_2nd_ed","245086772_Study_on_pilot_injection_of_DI_diesel_engine_using_common-rail_injection_system","231066604_Racing_Academy"]}
