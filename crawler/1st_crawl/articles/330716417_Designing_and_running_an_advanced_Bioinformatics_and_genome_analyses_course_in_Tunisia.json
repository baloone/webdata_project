{"id":"330716417_Designing_and_running_an_advanced_Bioinformatics_and_genome_analyses_course_in_Tunisia","abstract":"Genome data, with underlying new knowledge, are accumulating at exponential rate thanks to ever-improving sequencing technologies and the parallel development of dedicated efficient Bioinformatics methods and tools. Advanced Education in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses is to a large extent not accessible to students in developing countries where endeavors to set up Bioinformatics courses concern most often only basic levels. Here, we report a pioneering pilot experience concerning the design and implementation, from scratch, of a three-months advanced and extensive course in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses in the Institut Pasteur de Tunis. Most significantly the outcome of the course was upgrading the participantsâ€™ skills in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses to recognized international standards. Here we detail the different steps involved in the implementation of this course as well as the topics covered in the program. The description of this pilot experience might be helpful for the implementation of other similar educational projects, notably in developing countries, aiming to go beyond basics and providing young researchers with high-level skills.","authors":["Fatma Z Guerfali","Dhafer Laouini","Abdellatif Boudabous","Fredj Tekaia"],"meta":["January 2019PLoS Computational Biology 15(1)","DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006373"],"references":["320258552_Circos_An_information_aesthetic_for_comparative_genomics","320253244_Designing_a_course_model_for_distance-based_online_bioinformatics_training_in_Africa_The_H3ABioNet_experience","320090635_Ten_simple_rules_for_structuring_papers","317297018_Assessing_computational_genomics_skills_Our_experience_in_the_H3ABioNet_African_bioinformatics_network","314982998_Development_of_Bioinformatics_Infrastructure_for_Genomics_Research_in_H3Africa","297292133_Inferring_Orthologs_Open_Questions_and_Perspectives","292991129_The_Development_of_Computational_Biology_in_South_Africa_Successes_Achieved_and_Lessons_Learnt","319368695_Beyond_editing_to_writing_large_genomes","316617253_All_biology_is_computational_biology","299186586_Taking_computational_biology_to_the_bench","281849012_Bioinformatics_in_Africa_The_Rise_of_Ghana","263719870_Bioinformatics_Education-Perspectives_and_Challenges_out_of_Africa","261881950_Computational_Biology_and_Bioinformatics_in_Nigeria","261440087_How_to_Establish_a_Bioinformatics_Postgraduate_Degree_Programme_A_Case_Study_from_South_Africa","253861344_Opportunities_in_Africa_for_training_in_genome_science"]}
