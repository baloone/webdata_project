{"id":"339427588_Complexity_of_Self-assembled_Shapes_Extended_Abstract","abstract":"The connection between self-assembly and computation suggests that a shape can be considered the output of a self-assembly “program,” a set of tiles that fit together to create a shape. It seems plausible that the size of the smallest self-assembly program that builds a shape and the shape’s descriptional (Kolmogorov) complexity should be related. We show that under the notion of a shape that is independent of scale this is indeed so: in the Tile Assembly Model, the minimal number of distinct tile types necessary to self-assemble an arbitrarily scaled shape can be bounded both above and below in terms of the shape’s Kolmogorov complexity. As part of the proof of the main result, we sketch a general method for converting a program outputting a shape as a list of locations into a set of tile types that self-assembles into a scaled up version of that shape. Our result implies, somewhat counter-intuitively, that self-assembly of a scaled up version of a shape often requires fewer tile types, and suggests that the independence of scale in self-assembly theory plays the same crucial role as the independence of running time in the theory of computability.","authors":["David Soloveichik","Erik Winfree"],"meta":["January 2005","Conference: 10th International Workshop on DNA Computing (DNA10)"],"references":["220846176_Self-Assembled_Circuit_Patterns","30762060_Combinatorial_optimization_problems_in_self-assembly","12295372_Logical_computation_using_algorithmic_self-assembly_of_DNA_triple-crossover_molecules","8143645_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Sierpinski_Triangles","324398614_Tilings_and_Patterns","311647416_The_program-size_complexity_of_self-assembled_squares","243772945_Theory_and_Experiments_in_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly","242463956_The_Undecidability_of_the_Domino_Problem","238706828_Toward_a_Mathematical_Theory_of_Self-Assembly","231531497_Designed_Two-Dimensional_DNA_Holliday_Junction_Arrays_Visualized_by_Atomic_Force_Microscopy","226606019_Undecidability_and_Nonperiodicity_for_Tilings_of_the_Plane","220778965_Complexities_for_generalized_models_of_self-assembly","220424181_Proving_Theorems_by_Pattern_Recognition_-_II","50343800_Construction_Analysis_Ligation_and_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Triple_Crossover_Complexes","38380610_Nonrecursive_Tilings_of_the_Plane_II","38380609_Nonrecursive_Tilings_of_the_Plane_I","13578425_Design_and_Self-Assembly_of_Two-Dimensional_DNA_Crystals","2426541_Simulations_of_Computing_by_Self-Assembly"]}
