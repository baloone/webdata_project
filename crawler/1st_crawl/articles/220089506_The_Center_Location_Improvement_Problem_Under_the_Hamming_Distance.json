{"id":"220089506_The_Center_Location_Improvement_Problem_Under_the_Hamming_Distance","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the center location improvement problems under the sum-type and bottleneck-type Hamming distance. For the sum-type problem, we show that achieving an algorithm with a worst-case ratio of O(log |V|) is NP-hard, and for the bottleneck-type problem, we present a strongly polynomial algorithm.","authors":["Zhang Binwu","Jian zhong Zhang","Yong He"],"meta":["March 2005Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 9(2):187-198","DOI:10.1007/s10878-005-6856-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226985811_A_Network_Improvement_Problem_Under_Different_Norms","230158165_Improving_the_location_of_minimax_facilities_through_network_modification","222994009_Some_reverse_location_problems","221591442_A_Sub-Constant_Error-Probability_Low-Degree_Test_and_a_Sub-Constant_Error-Probability_PCP_Characterization_of_NP","221543770_Reverse_Center_Location_Problem","220089378_Weighted_Inverse_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problems_Under_Hamming_Distance"]}
