{"id":"269756781_College_Classroom_Seating_Position_and_Changes_in_Achievement_Motivation_over_a_Semester","abstract":"College students in freshman courses were given an inventory measuring achievement motivation at the beginning of the semester and again at the end. Consistent with previous findings, achievement motivation scores at the beginning of the semester were higher for students sitting in the front third of the classroom than for those sitting in the back two-thirds. Their higher scores were maintained at the end of the semester. It was inferred that the personal traits in achievement motivation disposed these students to choose to sit in the front or back of a classroom.","authors":["Jeffrey M. Burda","Charles I.
