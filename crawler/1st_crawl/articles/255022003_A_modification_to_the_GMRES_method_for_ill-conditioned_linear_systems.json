{"id":"255022003_A_modification_to_the_GMRES_method_for_ill-conditioned_linear_systems","abstract":"This paper concerns the use of a method for the solution of ill-conditioned linear systems. We show that the Generalized Minimum Residual Method (GMRES) in conjunction with a truncated singular value decomposition can be used to solve large nonsymmetric linear systems of equations which are nearly singular. Error bounds are given for the right singular vectors and singular values computed. A consequence of the error bounds results in a method for computing some of the singular values and right singular vectors for large matrices.","authors":["Meza"],"meta":["January 1995"],"references":["226270306_Deflated_Krylov_Subspace_Methods_for_Nearly_Singular_Linear_Systems","303350133_Krylov_subspace_methods_for_solving_large_unsymmetric_linear_systems","253879748_Deflated_Decomposition_of_Solutions_of_Nearly_Singular_System","250956417_A_Bidiagonalization-Regularization_Procedure_for_Large_Scale_Discretizations_of_Ill-Posed_Problems","243775333_Krylov_Subspace_Methods_for_Solving_Large_Unsymmetric_Linear_Systems","240965778_On_the_Implicit_Deflation_of_Nearly_Singular_System_of_Linear_Equations","238677433_The_principle_of_minimized_iteration_in_the_solution_of_the_matrix_eigenproblem","220432062_Computable_Error_Bounds_for_Aggregated_Markov_Chains","51992232_GMRES_A_Generalized_Minimal_Residual_Algorithm_for_Solving_Nonsymmetric_Linear_Systems"]}
