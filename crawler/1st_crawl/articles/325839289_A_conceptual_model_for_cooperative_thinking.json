{"id":"325839289_A_conceptual_model_for_cooperative_thinking","abstract":"Training computer scientists to address wicked problems means to focus respectively on the individual capability to think in a computational-oriented way (i.e., Computational Thinking), and on the social dimension of coding (i.e., Agile Values). In this study we propose the conceptual model of Cooperative Thinking, a new education construct of team-based computational problem solving. Cooperative Thinking is not only the sum of Computational Thinking and Agile Values, rather it is a new overarching competence suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems. We suggest to tackle the Cooperative Thinking construct as an education goal, to train new generations of software developers to Pareto-optimize both their individual and teaming performances.","authors":["Daniel Russo","Marcello Missiroli","Paolo Ciancarini"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1145/3183440.3195062","Conference: the 40th International Conference","Project: Computer Science Education"],"references":["321657402_Cooperative_Thinking_or_Computational_Thinking_Meets_Agile","308596596_Teamwork_Quality_and_Project_Success_in_Software_Development_A_Survey_of_Agile_Development_Teams","274309848_Computational_Thinking","220420371_Computational_thinking","285736724_Cooperative_learning_in_the_classroom","263849049_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","232479551_Relating_member_ability_and_personality_to_work-team_processes_and_team_effectiveness","220344953_System_Development_as_a_Wicked_Problem"]}
