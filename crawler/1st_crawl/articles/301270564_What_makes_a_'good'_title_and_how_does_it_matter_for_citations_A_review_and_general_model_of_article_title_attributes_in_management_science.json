Answers to this question are manifold, though inconclusive across disciplines. In an attempt to provide cohesion, we integrate significant title characteristics from previous studies across disciplines into a comprehensive model and link it with citation count. Keeping the application context constant, we focus on management science and find that only non-alpha numeric characters and a balanced title structure have small, but significant effects on citation count. Surprisingly, attributes which tended to show significant effects in other disciplines (though often in opposite directions), such as length, context, and linguistic attributes exhibited no relationship with citation count.","authors":["Lakshmi Balachandran Nair","Michael Gibbert"],"meta":["April 2016Scientometrics 107(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-016-1937-y"],"references":["282396992_Research_Article_Titles_and_Disciplinary_Conventions_A_Corpus_Study_of_Eight_Disciplines","275714282_When_Knowledge_Wins_Transcending_the_Sense_and_Nonsense_of_Academic_Rankings","275102894_The_relationship_between_manuscript_title_structure_and_success_Editorial_decisions_and_citation_performance_for_an_ecological_journal","271822996_Scholarly_Impact_Revisited","265689472_A_descriptive_study_of_inaccuracy_in_article_titles_on_bibliometrics_published_in_biomedical_journals","262388818_Short_and_amusing_The_relationship_between_title_characteristics_downloads_and_citations_in_psychology_articles","325001382_Determinants_of_Faculty_Pay_an_Agency_Theory_Perspective","313759679_A_power_primer","272569906_In_Pursuit_of_the_Colon_A_Century_of_Scholarly_Progress_1880-1980","270135480_Determinants_of_faculty_pay_An_Agency_Theory_perspective"]}
