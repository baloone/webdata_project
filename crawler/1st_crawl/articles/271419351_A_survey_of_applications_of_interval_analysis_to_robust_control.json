{"id":"271419351_A_survey_of_applications_of_interval_analysis_to_robust_control","abstract":"This paper surveys some significant applications of interval analysis to robust control field. Interval analysis is specially powerful in bounding the ranges of functions while providing mathematically rigorous results. This capability is especially welcome in robust control, since a variety of analysis and design problems can be cast in the evaluation of the range of functions over intervals. To organize the paper, the different approaches are classified into three control fields, which previously are stated: parametric space, frequency methods, discrete-time systems. Moreover, some other applications of intervals are included.","authors":["Josep Veh√≠"],"meta":["July 2002","DOI:10.3182/20020721-6-ES-1901.00399","Conference: World Congress"],"references":["233673418_Nonconvex_Polygon_Interval_Arithmetic_as_a_Tool_for_the_Analysis_and_Design_of_Robust_Control_Systems","227236718_Robust_Schur_Stability_of_Polynomials_with_Polynomial_Parameter_Dependency","224224242_Hybrid_geneticinterval_algorithm_for_semi-infinite_optimization","220252670_A_New_Approach_to_the_Modal_Regulator_Synthesis_for_Interval_Plant_with_Scalar_Input","220252656_Estimation_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_Using_Interval_Computation","3869634_Robust_modal_P_and_PI_regulator_synthesis_for_plant_with_interval_parameters_in_the_state_space","3089719_Model_selection_via_worst-case_criterion_for_nonlinear_bounded-error_estimation","3023183_Parametric_absolute_stability_of_Lur'e_systems","242917816_Foreword_-_Dear_Collegues","224666388_Robust_performance_design_of_fixed_structure_controller_with_uncertain_parameters","220252989_Analysis_of_the_Robustness_of_Predictive_Controllers_via_Modal_Intervals","220252923_Robust_Control_Using_Interval_Analysis","220252855_H-Control_Using_Polynomial_Matrices_and_Interval_Arithmetic","3886922_Variability_analysis_robust_design_of_electronic_system_using_cellular_evolutionary_strategies_interval_arithmetic_techniques","3217135_Digital_interval_modeling_and_hybrid_control_of_uncertain_systems","3022813_Global_Numerical_Approach_to_Nonlinear_Discrete-Time_Control"]}
