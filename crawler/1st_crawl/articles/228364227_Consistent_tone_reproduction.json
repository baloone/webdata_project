{"id":"228364227_Consistent_tone_reproduction","abstract":"In order to display images of high dynamic range (HDR), tone reproduction operators are usually applied that reduce the dynamic range to that of the display device. Gener-ally, parameters need to be adjusted for each new image to achieve good results. Consistent tone reproduction across different images is therefore difficult to achieve, which is especially true for global operators and to some lesser extent also for local operators. We propose an efficient global tone reproduction method that achieves robust re-sults across a large variety of HDR images without the need to adjust parameters. Consistency and efficiency make our method highly suitable for automated dynamic range com-pression, which for instance is necessary when a large num-ber of HDR images need to be converted.","authors":["Min H.
