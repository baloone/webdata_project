{"id":"314237570_Complete_Theory_of_Symmetry-based_Indicators_of_Band_Topology","abstract":"The interplay between symmetry and topology leads to a rich variety of electronic topological phases, protecting states such as topological insulators and Dirac semimetals. Here we focus on a different aspect of this interplay, where symmetry unambiguously indicates the presence of a topological band structure. Our study is comprehensive, encompassing all 230 space groups, and is built on two key advances. First, we find an efficient way to represent band structures in terms of elementary basis states, which are readily computed for each space group. Next, we isolate topological band structures by removing the set that represent simple atomic insulators, corresponding to localized Wannier orbitals. Special cases of our theory include the Fu-Kane parity criterion for inversion symmetric $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators, and the previously described filling-enforced quantum band insulators. We describe applications arising from new results.","authors":["Hoi Chun Po","Ashvin Vishwanath","Haruki Watanabe"],"meta":["March 2017Nature Communications 8(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-017-00133-2"],"references":["311492537_Topological_Classification_of_Crystalline_Insulators_through_Band_Structure_Combinatorics","310611052_Topological_Materials_Discovery_Through_the_Lens_of_Electron_Filling_Constraints","306531636_Filling-Enforced_Gaplessness_in_Band_Structures_of_the_230_Space_Groups","345777999_Topological_Insulators_and_Topological_Superconductors","321714023_International_Tables_for_Crystallography_Volume_A_Space-Group_Symmetry","314283143_Topological_quantum_chemistry","313096255_Topological_Crystalline_Materials_-General_Formulation_Module_Structure_and_Wallpaper_Groups-","312463411_Topological_Insulators_Contemporary_Concepts_of_Condensed_Matter_Science","306226927_Compactly-supported_Wannier_functions_and_algebraic_K-theory","302920466_Topology_of_nonsymmorphic_crystalline_insulators_and_superconductors","301842406_Colloquium_Topological_Band_Theory","283800216_Filling_constraints_for_spin-orbit_coupled_insulators_in_symmorphic_and_nonsymmorphic_crystals","278332561_Filling-Enforced_Quantum_Band_Insulators_in_Spin-Orbit_Coupled_Crystals","301839499_Space_group_constraints_on_weak_indices_in_topological_insulators","282403188_Twists_on_the_Torus_Equivariant_under_the_2-Dimensional_Crystallographic_Point_Groups"]}
