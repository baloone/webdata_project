{"id":"311616104_A_Generalization_of_Quasi-twisted_Codes_Multi-twisted_codes","abstract":"Cyclic codes and their various generalizations, such as quasi-twisted (QT) codes,\nhave a special place in algebraic coding theory. Among other things, many of the\nbest-known or optimal codes have been obtained from these classes. In this work\nwe introduce a new generalization of QT codes that we call multi-twisted (MT)\ncodes and study some of their basic properties. Presenting several methods of\nconstructing codes in this class and obtaining bounds on the minimum distances,\nwe show that there exist codes with good parameters in this class that cannot be\nobtained as QT or constacyclic codes. This suggests that considering this larger\nclass in computer searches is promising for constructing codes with better parameters\nthan currently best-known linear codes. Working with this new class of\ncodes motivated us to consider a problem about binomials over finite fields and to\ndiscover a result that is interesting in its own right.","authors":["Nuh Aydin","Ajdin Halilovic"],"meta":["May 2017Finite Fields and Their Applications 45(5):96-106","DOI:10.1016/j.ffa.2016.12.002"],"references":["317747437_New_binary_linear_codes_from_quasi-cyclic_codes_and_an_augmentation_algorithm","313801759_Some_results_on_the_structure_of_constacyclic_codes_and_new_linear_codes_over_GF7_from_quasi-twisted_codes","281775257_Some_new_quasi-twisted_ternary_linear_codes","248025403_The_structure_of_generalized_quasi_cyclic_codes","224319972_Some_Open_Problems_on_Quasi-Twisted_and_Related_Code_Constructions_and_Good_Quaternary_Codes","220638569_The_Structure_of_1-Generator_Quasi-Twisted_Codes_and_New_Linear_Codes","220317503_New_quinary_linear_codes_from_quasi-twisted_codes_and_their_duals","299273716_On_double_cyclic_codes_over_Z4","270593906_On_double_cyclic_codes_over_Z_4","263527784_New_quasi-twisted_ternary_linear_codes","220683407_New_good_quasi-cyclic_ternary_and_quaternary_linear_codes","3084886_New_Binary_One-Generator_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes","3084824_New_Quasi-Twisted_Degenerate_Ternary_Linear_Codes","3079356_The_intractability_of_computing_the_minimum_distance_of_a_code","3077802_Some_best_rate_1p_and_rate_p-1p_systematic_quasi-cyclic_codes"]}
