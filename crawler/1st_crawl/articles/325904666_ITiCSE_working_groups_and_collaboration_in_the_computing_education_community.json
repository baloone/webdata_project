{"id":"325904666_ITiCSE_working_groups_and_collaboration_in_the_computing_education_community","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the degree to which ITiCSE Working Groups have served to connect new researchers to the larger computing education community. Previous analysis of computing education research collaborations has concluded that computing education researchers collaborate with fewer people and that newcomers have a harder time integrating into the community, compared with other computer-science fields.\nThe ITiCSE Working Groups were explicitly omitted from this previous analysis, however. This paper presents an analysis over time of the collaboration network for the Working Groups and identifies the similarities and differences between it and networks previously reported. This analysis suggests that the ITiCSE Working Groups play an important role in building the computing education community.","authors":["Robert Mccartney","Kate Sanders"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1145/3197091.3197143","Conference: the 23rd Annual ACM Conference"],"references":["310792426_The_koli_calling_community","307090808_A_Picture_of_the_Growing_ICER_Community","254464072_Education_and_research_evidence_of_a_dual_life"]}
