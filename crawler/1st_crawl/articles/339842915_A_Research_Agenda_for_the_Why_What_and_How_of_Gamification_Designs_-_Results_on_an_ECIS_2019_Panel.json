{"id":"339842915_A_Research_Agenda_for_the_Why_What_and_How_of_Gamification_Designs_-_Results_on_an_ECIS_2019_Panel","abstract":"This report summarizes the discussion in a panel session on gamification designs at the 2019 European Conference on Information Systems in Stockholm, Sweden. The panel explores a research agenda for gamification design. The \"what, why, and how\" are considered to analyze the current state of the art of gamification research. An adapted definition of gamification is presented as one outcome of the workshop to better describe what gamifica-tion is and what it can be used for. \"Why\" and \"how\" to employ gamification are discussed for different contexts. This can be used to gamify information systems, identity outcomes that are addressed by gamification concepts, and explore new ways of how to gamify. Overall, the panel presents new areas for future research and practice by identifying innovative ways to bring existing gamification concepts to a more impactful level.","authors":["Sofia Schöbel","Andreas Janson","Katharina Jahn","Bastian Kordyaka"],"meta":["March 2020Communications of the Association for Information Systems","DOI:10.17705/1CAIS.04630","Projects: KoLeArnSerious gamesNudging Privacy in der digitalisierten Arbeitswelt – Systematische Konzeptentwicklung und Pilotierung (Nudger)"],"references":["336568065_Accumulation_and_Evolution_of_Design_Knowledge_in_Design_Science_Research_-_A_Journey_Through_Time_and_Space","335708378_Ladders_for_Learning_Is_Scaffolding_the_Key_to_Teaching_Problem-Solving_in_Technology-Mediated_Learning_Contexts","333421600_To_Nudge_or_Not_To_Nudge_Ethical_Considerations_of_Digital_Nudging_Based_on_Its_Behavioral_Economics_Roots","333263812_Towards_a_Unified_Understanding_of_Digital_Nudging_by_Addressing_its_Analog_Roots","327936554_Is_it_All_About_Having_Fun_-_Developing_a_Taxonomy_to_Gamify_Information_Systems","327059975_Play_to_Learn_Conducting_a_Playtest_Session_for_Improving_an_Educational_Game_Completed_Research","334855775_Simulation_Games_Learning_Goal_Orientations_and_Norms_for_Knowledge_Sharing","331689963_Privacy_Through_Certification_The_New_Certification_Scheme_of_the_General_Data_Protection_Regulation_Analytical_Solutions","331276442_Digital_Nudging_and_Privacy_Improving_Decisions_about_Self-disclosure_in_Social_Networks","328809976_Making_Digital_Nudging_Applicable_The_Digital_Nudge_Design_Method"]}
