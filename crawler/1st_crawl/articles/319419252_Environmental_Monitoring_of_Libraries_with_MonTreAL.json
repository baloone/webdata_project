{"id":"319419252_Environmental_Monitoring_of_Libraries_with_MonTreAL","abstract":"An ever-increasing amount of devices connected over the Internet pave the road towards the realization of the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) idea. With IoT, endangered infrastructures can easily be enriched with low-cost, energy-efficient monitoring solutions, thus alerting is possible before severe damage occurs. We developed a library wide humidity and temperature monitoring framework MonTreAL, which runs on commodity single board computers. In addition, our primary objectives are to enable flexible data collection among a computing cluster by migrating virtualization approaches of data centers to IoT infrastructures.","authors":["Marcel Großmann","Steffen Illig","Cornelius Matějka"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-67008-9_52","Conference: International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries","Project: Sensor based monitoring of cultural heritage"],"references":["298798767_Performance_evaluation_of_a_cheap_open_source_digital_environmental_monitor_based_on_the_Raspberry_Pi","283464988_A_smart_system_connecting_e-health_sensors_and_the_cloud","318520709_Klimaregulierung_in_Bibliotheksmagazinen","308670704_Supersensors_Raspberry_Pi_Devices_for_Smart_Campus_Infrastructure"]}
