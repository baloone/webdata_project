{"id":"303691938_Coupled_Nose-Hoover_Lattice_A_set_of_the_Nose-Hoover_equations_with_different_temperatures","abstract":"A simple scheme was presented to couple any number of the Nos√©-Hoover equations with different heat-bath temperatures. In general, several practical procedures can be considered to realize such a coupling, where the system is under nonequilibrium. However, the current scheme provides an equilibrium distribution, namely, a smooth invariant measure for the present system. This is attained by a very simple idea, that is, a force scaling. The current scheme realizes coupled differential equations, analogous to coupled maps. Its theoretical possibilities, mathematical framework, and practical utilities are discussed. Numerical validations applying the method to a simple two-oscillator system are provided.","authors":["Ikuo Fukuda"],"meta":["May 2016Physics Letters A 380(33)","DOI:10.1016/j.physleta.2016.05.051"],"references":["287996327_Canonical_Dynamics_Equilibrium_Phase-Space_Distributions","283705988_Double_density_dynamics_Realizing_a_joint_distribution_of_a_physical_system_and_a_parameter_system","274012216_Ergodic_Time-Reversible_Chaos_for_Gibbs'_Canonical_Oscillator","263811870_Nonergodicity_of_the_Nose-Hoover_chain_thermostat_in_computationally_achievable_time","237725107_Kinetic_moments_method_for_the_canonical_ensemble_distribution","234921675_Nos-Hoover_chains_The_canonical_ensemble_via_continuous_dynamics","216635355_Spatiotemporal_Intermittency_in_Coupled_Map_Lattices","43048518_Comment_on_Preserving_the_Boltzmann_ensemble_in_replica-exchange_molecular_dynamics_J_Chem_Phys_129_164112_2008","13392299_Canonical_dynamics_of_the_Nos_oscillator_Stability_order_and_chaos","12008408_Fermi-Pasta-Ulam_b_Model_Boundary_Jumps_Fourier's_Law_and_Scaling","2334729_Fourier_Law_A_Challenge_To_Theorists","2145949_Strange_Heat_Flux_in_AnHarmonic_Networks","2090849_Fourier's_Law_for_a_Harmonic_Crystal_with_Self-Consistent_Stochastic_Reservoirs","1781386_Non-Equilibrium_Statistical_Mechanics_of_Anharmonic_Chains_Coupled_to_Two_Heat_Baths_at_Different_Temperatures","299358243_Coupled_Nose-Hoover_equations_of_motion_to_implement_a_fluctuating_heat-bath_temperature","236203670_Hamiltonian_Thermostats_Fail_to_Promote_Heat_Flow","231399907_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations_of_a_Protein_in_the_Canonical_Ensemble","224043541_Pattern_Formation_Outside_of_Equilibrium","222447200_Sugita_Y_Okamoto_Y_Replica-exchange_molecular_dynamics_method_for_protein_folding_Chem_Phys_Lett_314_141-151","222022911_Canonical_ensembles_from_chaos","220043979_A_Unified_Formulation_of_the_Constant_Temperature_Molecular_Dynamics_Method","23671713_Numerical_Examination_of_the_Extended_Phase-Space_Volume-Preserving_Integrator_by_the_Nose-Hoover_Molecular_Dynamics_Equations","13329293_Dynamical_behavior_of_a_thermostated_isotropic_harmonic_oscillator","11497685_Tsallis_dynamics_using_the_Nose-Hoover_approach","7175440_Construction_of_an_extended_invariant_for_an_arbitrary_ordinary_differential_equation_with_its_development_in_a_numerical_integration_algorithm"]}
