{"id":"342054397_Quantum_generative_adversarial_network_for_generating_discrete_distribution","abstract":"Quantum machine learning has recently attracted much attention from the community of quantum computing. In this paper, we explore the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) based on quantum computing. More specifically, we propose a quantum GAN for generating classical discrete distribution, which has a classical-quantum hybrid architecture and is composed of a parameterized quantum circuit as the generator and a classical neural network as the discriminator. The parameterized quantum circuit only consists of simple one-qubit rotation gates and two-qubit controlled-phase gates that are available in current quantum devices. Our scheme has the following characteristics and potential advantages: (i) It is intrinsically capable of generating discrete data (e.g., text data), while classical GANs are clumsy for this task due to the vanishing gradient problem. (ii) Our scheme avoids the input/output bottlenecks embarrassing most of the existing quantum learning algorithms that either require to encode the classical input data into quantum states, or output a quantum state corresponding to the solution instead of giving the solution itself, which inevitably compromises the speedup of the quantum algorithm. (iii) The probability distribution implicitly given by data samples can be loaded into a quantum state, which may be useful for some further applications.","authors":["Haozhen Situ","Zhi-Min He","Yuyi Wang","Lvzhou Li"],"meta":["October 2020Information Sciences 538:193-208","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2020.05.127"],"references":["332088465_Adversarial_quantum_circuit_learning_for_pure_state_approximation","331949206_Quantum_machine_learning","330819096_Quantum_algorithm_for_visual_tracking","330653968_Quantum_generative_adversarial_learning_in_a_superconducting_quantum_circuit","323722413_Learning_the_quantum_algorithm_for_state_overlap","322675079_A_generative_modeling_approach_for_benchmarking_and_training_shallow_quantum_circuits","319977195_Quantum_Autoencoders_via_Quantum_Adders_with_Genetic_Algorithms","316908137_Inductive_Supervised_Quantum_Learning","311514664_Quantum_autoencoders_for_efficient_compression_of_quantum_data","311430180_Quantum_generalisation_of_feedforward_neural_networks","311067084_Quantum_Machine_Learning","308391942_Quantum-Enhanced_Machine_Learning","305780465_Characterizing_Quantum_Supremacy_in_Near-Term_Devices","303486292_Quantum_algorithm_for_association_rules_mining","283471219_Adaptation_of_reproducing_kernel_algorithm_for_solving_fuzzy_Fredholm-Volterra_integrodifferential_equations","266261903_Entanglement-Based_Quantum_Machine_Learning","258085144_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Data_Fitting","235638955_Experimental_Quantum_Computing_to_Solve_Systems_of_Linear_Equations","324744952_Quantum_generative_adversarial_networks","324744809_Quantum_Generative_Adversarial_Learning","324492525_Differentiable_Learning_of_Quantum_Circuit_Born_Machine","324151137_Towards_Quantum_Machine_Learning_with_Tensor_Networks","323549997_Quantum_Circuit_Learning","323257273_Quantum_Variational_Autoencoder","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319436962_Quantum_algorithm_for_support_matrix_machines","305166882_InfoGAN_Interpretable_Representation_Learning_by_Information_Maximizing_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","278733352_Deep_Generative_Image_Models_using_a_Laplacian_Pyramid_of_Adversarial_Networks","265554809_Quantum_artificial_neural_networks_with_applications","261175435_Numerical_solution_of_systems_of_second-order_boundary_value_problems_using_continuous_genetic_algorithm","256503341_An_optimization_algorithm_for_solving_systems_of_second-order_singular_boundary_value_problems","251327761_Quantenmechanik_der_Stossvorgange_Z_Phys_37863","243964117_Quantum_principal_component_analysis","243964048_Quantum_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Big_Data_Classification","222197578_Quantum_artificial_neural_network_architectures_and_components","38082160_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Linear_Systems_of_Equations"]}
