Corresponding changes traditionally reflected by humans as evolution (reformational) or revolution (transformational) processes, that are realizing corresponding quantitative or qualitative steps within the development of peopleâ€™s Life Activities. First 20 years of 21-st Century presented a real start of serious qualitative changes as a process of implementation up to date achievements of modern Science and Technologies. These are transformational changes not only within physical background of our traditional Life, but fast developing of corresponding changes also within our spiritual (or mental) Life (Broks, 2016). The central phenomenon within the mentioned processes above today is the development of overall computerization of physical as well as mental Life Activities of Humans. Global, regional, local explosion of information as an artefact of revolution within Computer Science and Information Technology marks the above mentioned beginning of the 21-st century. So, our life today is becoming more and more complex by means of increasing diversity and speed of corresponding changes. Virus COVID-19 attack has just only accelerated these changes. Global turnover of Biological as well as Computer viruses is part of modern Life today for tomorrow.","authors":["Andris Broks"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Baltic Science Education 19(5):692-695","DOI:10.33225/jbse/20.19.692"],"references":["354012144_SYSTEMS_THEORY_OF_SYSTEMS_THINKING_GENERAL_AND_PARTICULAR_WITHIN_MODERN_SCIENCE_AND_TECHNOLOGY_EDUCATION","295559159_Scientific_thinking_The_backbone_of_modern_science_and_technology_education"]}
