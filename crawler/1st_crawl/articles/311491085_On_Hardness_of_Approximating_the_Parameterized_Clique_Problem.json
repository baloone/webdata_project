{"id":"311491085_On_Hardness_of_Approximating_the_Parameterized_Clique_Problem","abstract":"In the Gap-clique (k, k/2) problem, the input is an n-vertex graph G, and the goal is to decide whether G contains a clique of size k or contains no clique of size k/2. It is an open question in the study of fixed parameterized tractability whether the Gap-clique (k, k/2) problem is fixed parameter tractable, i.e., whether it has an algorithm that runs in time f(k) ⋅ nα, where f(k) is an arbitrary function of the parameter k and the exponent α is a constant independent of k.\nIn this paper, we give some evidence that the Gap-clique(k, k/2) problem is not fixed parameter tractable. Specifically, we define a constraint satisfaction problem, which we call Deg-2-sat, where the input is a system of k' quadratic equations in k' variables over a finite field F of size n', and the goal is to decide whether there is a solution in F that satisfies all the equations simultaneously. The main result in this paper is an \"FPT-reduction\" from Deg-2-sat to the Gap-clique(k, k/2) problem. If one were to hypothesize that the Deg-2-sat problem is not fixed parameter tractable, then our reduction would imply that the Gap-clique(k, k/2) problem is not fixed parameter tractable either. The reduction relies on the algebraic techniques used in proof of the PCP theorem.","authors":["Subhash Khot","Igor Shinkar"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1145/2840728.2840733","Conference: the 2016 ACM Conference"],"references":["234794393_Proof_Verification_and_the_Hardness_of_Approximation_Problems","234783217_Interactive_proofs_and_the_hardness_of_approximating_cliques","226785142_On_Parameterized_Approximability","222537142_Cutting_Up_Is_Hard_To_Do_The_Parameterised_Complexity_of_k-Cut_and_Related_Problems","220618318_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_and_Completeness_I_Basic_Results","220345621_Non-abelian_homomorphism_testing_and_distributions_close_to_their_self-convolutions","2607238_Algebraic_Methods_for_Interactive_Proof_Systems","2329275_Self-TestingCorrecting_with_Applications_to_Numerical_Problems","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","242490225_Approximating_clique_is_almost_NP-complete","228057642_Probabilistic_checking_of_proofs_A_new_characterization_of_NP","226510428_Systems_of_algebraic_equations","222569763_Machine-based_methods_in_parameterized_complexity_theory","222307097_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_and_Completeness_II_On_Completeness_for_W1","221149851_Systems_of_algebraic_equations","220432172_IP_PSPACE","220345368_On_an_online_random_k-SAT_model","30987752_Parameterized_Complexity_and_Approximation_Algorithms"]}
