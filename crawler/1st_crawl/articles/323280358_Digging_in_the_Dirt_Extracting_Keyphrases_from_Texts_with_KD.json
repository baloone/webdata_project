{"id":"323280358_Digging_in_the_Dirt_Extracting_Keyphrases_from_Texts_with_KD","abstract":"In this paper we present a keyphrase extraction system called Keyphrase Digger (KD). The tool uses both statistical measures and linguistic information to detect a weighted list of n-grams representing the most important concepts of a text. KD is the reimplemen-tation of an existing tool, which has been extended with new features, a high level of customizability, a shorter processing time and an extensive evaluation on different text genres in English and Italian (i.e. scientific articles and historical texts).","authors":["Giovanni Moretti","Rachele Sprugnoli","Sara Tonelli"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.4000/books.aaccademia.1518","Conference: Second Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLiC-it 2015)At: Trento, Italy"],"references":["279541579_Introducing_Distiller_a_Lightweight_Framework_for_Knowledge_Extraction_and_Filtering","272091377_The_Stanford_CoreNLP_Natural_Language_Processing_Toolkit","265888804_Key-concept_extraction_from_French_articles_with_KX","220875260_A_Study_on_Automatically_Extracted_Keywords_in_Text_Categorization","220479857_Learning_Algorithms_for_Keyphrase_Extraction","271569373_'The_Futurist_mountains'_Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti's_experiences_of_mountain_combat_in_the_First_World_War","270878396_Automatic_Keyphrase_Extraction_A_Survey_of_the_State_of_the_Art","220746576_The_TextPro_Tool_Suite","215470768_Probabilistic_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_Using_Decision_Trees"]}
