{"id":"271855251_Graph_Isomorphism_Color_Refinement_and_Compactness","abstract":"Color refinement is a classical technique to show that two given graphs $G$\nand $H$ are non-isomorphic; it is very efficient, even if incomplete in\ngeneral. We call a graph $G$ amenable to color refinement if this algorithm\nsucceeds in distinguishing $G$ from any non-isomorphic graph $H$. Babai,\nErd\\H{o}s, and Selkow (1982) proved that almost all graphs $G$ are amenable. We\nhere determine the exact range of applicability of color refinement by showing\nthat the class of all amenable graphs is recognizable in time $O((n+m)\\log n)$,\nwhere $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and the number of edges in the\ninput graph.\nFurthermore, we prove that amenable graphs are compact in the sense of\nTinhofer (1991), that is, their polytopes of fractional automorphisms are\nintegral. The concept of compactness was introduced in order to identify the\nclass of graphs $G$ for which isomorphism $G\\cong H$ can be decided by\ncomputing an extreme point of the polytope of fractional isomorphisms from $G$\nto $H$ and checking if this point is integral. Our result implies that this\nlinear programming approach to isomorphism testing has the applicability range\nat least as large as the combinatorial approach based on color refinement.","authors":["Vikraman Arvind","Johannes KÃ¶bler","Gaurav Rattan","Oleg Verbitsky"],"meta":["September 2017computational complexity 26(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-016-0147-6","SourcearXiv","Project: isomorphism testing"],"references":["324398168_Finite_Graphs_and_Networks_An_Introduction_with_Applications","322489675_CANONICAL_LABELLING_OF_GRAPHS_IN_LINEAR_AVERAGE_TIME","300569595_On_the_Power_of_Color_Refinement","287591627_Power_iterated_color_refinement","283819673_On_Tinhofer's_Linear_Programming_Approach_to_Isomorphism_Testing","274319981_Graphs_Identified_by_Logics_with_Counting","267465839_Fractional_Graph_Theory_--_A_Rational_Approach","267434432_Tight_Lower_and_Upper_Bounds_for_the_Complexity_of_Canonical_Colour_Refinement","267113963_Combinatorial_Matrix_Classes","266458350_Fractional_Graph_Theory_A_Rational_Approach_to_the_Theory_of_Graphs"]}
