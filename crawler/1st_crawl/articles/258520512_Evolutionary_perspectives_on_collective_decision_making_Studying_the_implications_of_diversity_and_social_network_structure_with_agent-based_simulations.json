Using an evolutionary theory approach to collective decision\nmaking, agent-based simulations were conducted to investigate how collective\ndecision making would be affected by the agents' diversity in problem\nunderstanding and/or behavior in discussion, as well as by their social network\nstructure. Simulation results indicated that groups with consistent problem\nunderstanding tended to produce higher utility values of ideas and displayed\nbetter decision convergence, but only if there was no group-level bias in\ncollective problem understanding. Simulation results also indicated the\nimportance of balance between selection-oriented (i.e., exploitative) and\nvariation-oriented (i.e., explorative) behaviors in discussion to achieve\nquality final decisions. Expanding the group size and introducing non-trivial\nsocial network structure generally improved the quality of ideas at the cost of\ndecision convergence. Simulations with different social network topologies\nrevealed that collective decision making on small-world networks with high\nlocal clustering tended to achieve highest decision quality more often than on\nrandom or scale-free networks. Implications of this evolutionary theory and\nsimulation approach for future managerial research on collective, group, and\nmulti-level decision making are discussed.","authors":["Hiroki Sayama","Shelley D Dionne","Francis J.
