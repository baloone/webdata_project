{"id":"327977298_A_Concise_Depiction_of_Cosmological_Experiments","abstract":"Familiar data structures from computer science are cast in the form of Monads and Comonads and their application to laboratory physics is demonstrated. These data structures are then used to model a cosmological thought experiment introduced by Hardy, encoding and relating fixed causal structure and structure free situations. The data structures are harmonized in a diagrammatic calculus and the thought experiment is calculated therein.","authors":["Ben Sprott"],"meta":["September 2018","Project: Foundations of Physics and Science: Data and Theories"],"references":["322766016_Experiments_and_Theories_A_Fundamental_Model","47860189_Informational_derivation_of_Quantum_Theory","265051991_When_Is_a_Container_a_Comonad","221550829_Bases_as_Coalgebras","51953954_On_the_Reality_of_the_Quantum_State","24168211_Convex_Spaces_I_Definition_and_Examples"]}
