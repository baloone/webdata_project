{"id":"233541026_Turning_weakness_into_strength_Strategies_for_future_LIS","abstract":"Purpose – LIS has been described as a fragmented field in crisis, with an increased competition from other fields; and lacking in development of theories. The purpose of this paper is to articulate a strategy in which the perceived weakness can be seen as a source of strength.\nDesign/methodology/approach – The text builds mostly on reflections on meta-theoretical and science-organisation literature. Ten distinct problems for the research field are identified and discussed in order to provide a viable strategy for the future.\nFindings – While it is common to suggest a convergent movement toward the idealised characteristics of the strong research discipline as a recipe against fragmentation, a strong convergent movement is suggested that feeds off the fragmented character of the field. What is commonly perceived as a weakness, the multidimensional character of the field, can be translated into a strategic resource.\nOriginality/value – The paper provides a fresh perspective on the strategic situation of LIS.","authors":["Jan Nolin","Fredrik Astrom"],"meta":["January 2010Journal of Documentation 66(1):7-27","DOI:10.1108/00220411011016344"],"references":["297387756_Whither_information_science","283407078_Information_science_Origin_evolution_and_relations","280895340_Visualizing_a_discipline_An_author_co-citation_analysis_of_information_science_1972-1995","279411053_Library_and_Information_Science_Its_Content_and_Scope","275469153_Born_Digital_Understanding_the_First_Generation_of_Digital_Natives","271695620_Curriculum_and_Catastrophe_Change_in_Professional_Education","270746754_A_Sociological_Theory_of_Scientific_Change","270421127_Professions_and_Patriarchy","270162336_In_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","270113262_Academic_Tribes_and_Territories_Intellectual_Enquiry_and_the_Cultures_of_Disciplines"]}
